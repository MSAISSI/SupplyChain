Feature Request Portal for loyal customers like canny.io, where we could easily add bugs and requests! You should not make it hard for people to give feedback and vote on it! Especially when we pay high amounts yearly.2. Styling, theme, and looks are just super ugly and outdated.3. Hard to change the styling, even with CSS it's a big mess to change field sizes, centering etc.4. In an era of Typeform and Jotform, Gravity should be much more modern with buttonized checkboxes/multi-select lists, auto-continue after entry, continue by pressing enter, etc.5. CRM integrations are lacking, it's well integrated but there are many essential things missing, like company fields, which force one to buy another expensive plugin from a third-party seller.6. No integration with push services like One Signal7. Many basic things missing, like international phone prefix selector etc. which then has to be bought again from third-party vendors...8. Lack of deep integration with industry-standard builders as Cornerstone and Elementor"
