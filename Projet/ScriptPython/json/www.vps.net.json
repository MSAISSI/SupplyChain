They won't reply to my emails to request to speak to a human, they simply ignore. I predict they will reply to this review to make it look like their service is good, but  the email address they provided last time I never got a response from. Don't fall for it."

When I questioned them about it, their support staff were slow, unhelpful, and defensive. I've been a customer for over a decade so I'm really disappointed in where their level of service has gone to. Update: after the reply below, I reached out to them via the email provided, and am still awaiting anything back from them. They take your money, but won't speak to you."

Activation took more then 3 days2. Scaling up and down didn't work so had to work with support a lot to make them fix their bugs3. They constantly disable your account if you don\u2019t login.4. At some point they said 'ups, we accidently removed a server' so I lost all my VPSs at the time. Luckily I only decided to keep 2 and had backups to migrate the rest to a better hosting because of the #5...5. A month ago they decided to remove some servers again. This time they sent an email about it. I asked them to help with taking a snapshot and to migrate myVPSs to their new environment. After not doing it for over a week the deadline for migration was reached and they only said sorry that they didn't do it.Don't fall into their trap of giv8ng you credits as you will lose more time with them or just run disposable servers that you can afford to lose."

The network speed fluctuated from 10 - 250 Mbps at different times of day without any consistency when tested with speedtest-cli. CPU (CPU family: 6, Model: 13) performance was also pretty low at around 2.5 GHz compared to 3.5 GHz CPUs that can be expected at that price bracket. (dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=1024 | md5sum) o/p was around 350 MB/s which could easily surpass 600 MB/s for a 3.5 GHz virtual processor. On top of that, no money back policy means that I already lost my money."

They'll sell you the plan stating a cheap price, then in my case add on additional products without any authorisation and claim they are needed for your account to work.When I realised they had done this and explained I cannot afford the add-ons nor had I authorised them and the monthly payments to be taken from my account and asked for refund. They said they don't do refunds.Their customer service is short, unapologetic and they lack any moral or ethical value towards their customers.I would strongly advise staying away unless you want an endless complicated interaction with their customer service who will try and spin webs"

          "Contenu": "VPS.NET is a scam!!!On January 4, 2020 I wanted to cancel my account because we moved to Azure and continued to have issues with our billing and server. The only way to cancel is to send a request via the user portal. I did that and then the next day got a message asking how they could keep me. I explained it was that we moved to Azure and simply wanted to cancel. On January 6, I changed my email address associated with the VPS.NET account, but made a typo in the email address so the validation email kept being sent to a email that didn't exist. Rather than VPS.NET not accepting the change and continuing with my old email which is your user name they kept the new mistyped one which locked me out because it wasn't able to be validated. On January 7, I called them and first was sent to a voice mail in billing that cuts you off before you can say much. I then called back and tried support who quickly transferred me to billing.This time I got a lady who would not help and insisted all issues must be submitted via email. I explained I tried to email billing but they wouldn't respond back and I needed her help since I couldn't get into the portal to send messages from it and confirm the account was cancelled. She refused and said there was nothing she could do. I then asked to escalate the issue to her supervisor. Her response was \"Sorry there is no one here that can help you.\" I then asked for any other person in the building and she again responded \"Sorry there is no on in the building that can help you. All requests must be via email.\"This is ridiculous!! Stay away from VPS.NET they are simply trying to get you to give them your credit card info. From day one our server had to be rebooted every day and we could not find the reason. I think this is a mom and pop shop that is a scam just trying to get your money. Even their advertised 24/7 chat support is nonsense. I tired several times with it and no one ever answered the chat session. THEY ARE CROOKS!!!"

Tried to restart MySQL but it kept failing.After a few hours a long email was sent detailing what was checked.  It said that I might want to try to reboot server and see if that helps. (I checked ok to reboot server in ticket).Anyway, I rebooted server from  the vps dashboard and that fixed everything.A lot of time was wasted by VPS and me on this and I almost did a restore but fortunately I wanted to make sure that was 100% my last option.   A server reboot should have been done much earlier in the troubleshooting process, certainly before I was told to try a restore."
