          "Titre": "MBM ok, mlm and support: the opposite",
          "Contenu": "If you want to use MBM with mlm, a PHP script to manage subsriptions on your Website and synchronize them with MBM, at least find and download the standalone version and fix all errors by yourself, as the script bundled with the mac download has not been updated to the fixed version and contains a flaw which does prevent it from using SMTP. Version 3.2.0 contains a typo. Although I had to find the error by myself and reported it 2 weeks ago, the mac download as of today has not been updated and support didn't even react verbally on that report. The standalone version 3.2.1 states it to be fixed since 2019-11-29, which as of today is more than six months ago.Test mlm thoroughly before buying MBM, as support comes in the form of  not reading messages, \"mlm is a free script\", \"I don't know\" and \"why should I answer, if I don't know?\" and that's about the end of it. No questions more than asking for screenshots, no info about system requirements. Have a look at the style of support in the forums for it and you'll see what I mean.But as if this weren't enough, add a hint on the website to set register_globals to \"on\" in order to circumvent problems with the script, which in terms of security has been known as irresponsible for years. The script contains undeclared variables.Knowing all of the above beforehand would have prevented 2 people spending several hours trying to find and fix errors and getting useful or even just interested, friendly and timely answers from support.2 points, because of the easy refund and because MBM in itself seems to work good as a standalone solution. Its interface could be a bit less 2002, though.I hope I could prevent my emotions from influencing this report and it is of help for others in search of a toolset for mailing list management.---------------UPDATE 2 weeks after my initial review:Concerning the reply: qed (= not addressing any problems mentioned in the review).The Mac software package still has not been updated with mlm 3.2.1. I just cannot understand why a developer does not care about delivering software with known and already fixed bugs frustrating his potential customers. I can come up with many good and bad explanations for such behaviour. MBM is a useful software, just be warned that if you need to integrate subscriber management on your website and/or need to use SMTP for sending mails, you're on your own. My advice is: get the fixed standalone download of mlm and check it thoroughly. Do not set REGISTER_GLOBALS to ON, as is suggested in the FAQ.UPDATE 3The point is that I have neither been bombarded with questions (but with unrelated tutorial videos) nor have I received a reply on the mail with the screenshots until I asked for it some days later. Then the answer was the question, why you should answer at all, if you didn't have any idea.Sorry, but there's been more than one strange moments in our communication. Not a single one of your messages addressed the questions asked or provided any helpful hints, e.g. about system requirements or that there already is a fixed version of the script or whatever.Enough with that. Have a nice day and happy clients from now on."

Another more glaring glitch was seeing a long list (over 300) of email addresses that were marked as Bad and \"impossible to test this email address\". But when I ran those same names individually most of them came back as vaild. But on those names I ran them twice as individuals. Some reported bad initially then either automatically changed to valid or were marked valid upon a second testing.  Please work on those items and you will have a perfect program!
