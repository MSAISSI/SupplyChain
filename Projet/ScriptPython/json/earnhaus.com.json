If you aren't key demographic they are looking for, you get blocked by every survey even the terrible ones (ie- $0.15 for a 20minute survey)I guess I should've lied about my age, race, job, etc so I could actually take a survey. That's what I get for being honest."

          "Contenu": "Not impressed with this survey site at all. never took so many surveys and wasted so much time to only be told, not a good fit. I know how survey sites should work and I use another one very successfully. I just wanted to try this one and see how it went. Tremendous waste of time. Spent over a week on surveys and tried to cash out at $5 only to find out you take a $1 fee. So I took another 2 weeks to try to get to $10 to no avail. I have 3 outstanding surveys where I am told I have to wait over a month to find out if i get paid. I got tired of trying to get to 10 and just ate the ridiculous fee and cashed out. Meanwhile the other site I used I can get 10/day. And I don't want to hear the excuse I was given it's because they are dup surveys. They are not. So overall, this site is a big fat no from me."

I receive notifications for surveys and when I go take the survey I get denied after answering my gender or my age. One thing I don't get is when I get asked my D.O.B. then very next question what is my age. Another thing that I thing is bogus is the evaluation deal. On some of them I have to purchase or subscribe to something in order to receive payment and the pay out is less than the subscription. I don't know what to think this survey deal anymore because it seems I get the run around more than getting to participate in any survey. I didn't want to even give this review one star but I did just for the fact that my experience in the beginning was great and after a few months have past it has slowly began to change in a negative way ."

However, I just started letting the site direct me thinking that would solve the problem.  I just spent 10-15 minutes on a survey and mid survey it just sent me to a different site to start a whole new survey (progress bar reset to zero - different company name).  I did not get paid for the first survey nor it tell me why it just switched to a different survey but I wasn't going to waste my time jumping around for no reward. No idea how people say they make money.  I literally spent at least two hours and couldn't get over $2.60.  Seems like a scam."

Apparently they didn\u2019t accept them. I\u2019m always truthful thid compamy really stinks surveys pay low and god forbid two surveys ask the same thing but just a tad different that makes of forces you to anwser differently you\u2019ll start being disqualified right away.

They say that you do three surveys and you get $5 well I did three surveys it took me over 2 hours and I got nothing except for an invitation to take more surveys and them telling me that they'll give me credit for the ones I've already taken soon they do not pay the same day because you cannot earn enough credits the same day to even cash out you would not have enough hours in the day to do the surveys like I said the surveys are so long and repetitive it's ridiculous one hour for one survey and no credit!"

I have a problem with the fact that they will sucker you in to doing a survey for a particular price and then all of a sudden it kicks you out of that specific survey and boots you to a survey that is much longer and gives you way less pay. Or how about when they don't pay you immediately after taking a survey and they say they are reviewing it further, then nothing else is ever heard about the survey or that money so I count that as my time being wasted and it aggravates me terribly. I have never received any money from a survey that has went to review and I have at the least 30+ surveys in review right now so like I said that is a big waste of my time. I believe there needs to be a better understanding of how money is earned and the way the surveys are reviewed also a reason as to why exactly the surveys were not accepted to receive the aloted pay."

Well I did sign up and I did NOT get the reward.  It was the 2nd time today that I have had to sign up for something.  Last time I did get the reward, but this time I did not.

Yes, it's true I received the $10 within 1-2 minutes to my paypal. GREAT, that made me happy. Well now I want to continue doing surveys on this site, and everytime I get halfway thru one, a screen pops up saying answers are being looked thru??? Whatever that's supposed to mean. I am as honest as I can be doing these surveys, I received a measly $10 and now can't do or get thru any surveys. I guess my opinion doesn't matter, and now I believe that this site is a joke! Since I've home from the grocery store, I've been trying to complete just ONE survey and I can't.  So not only have I wasted A LOT of time, I don't get any compensation for doing so, like the other survey sites."

I can see why others are frustrated as well. I thought this was going to be a good site to earn a little pocket change because believe me no one gets rich doing surveys but the little bit does help out. Hopefully they will correct this issue or a lot of people will be leaving their site for others where they can actually get rewarded for their time. Do better Earn Haus!!! Make your site as great as we all know it can be. Don\u2019t get peoples hopes up of actually finding a good site, only to be let down!! Once I see a change, I will be very glad to change my review!!"

After my first redemption I am getting a lot of messages that read along the lines of \"We are reviewing your answers. This is perfectly normal\". I have no way to gage my progress toward redemption all while my answers/valuable data have already benefited the 3rd party. This all happened AFTER my first redemption. Stalling and reviewing to me seems more of a way to maintain collection of data without paying out the promised rewards. In turn, thus equals to the exact same hassle of every other \"legit\" survey site exhibits. It would be most impressive if the reviewing of data would stop.There is nothing to review...if there were indiscretions in my answers then the survey should've (like most) kicked me out or disqualified me. If a survey is completed then the immediate award should reflect. I have provided valuable data as a show of good faith that the company will honor them rather than pulling stunts that only conform this company to be like every other that offers false pretense and empty promises."

Early this morning this morning I did two surveys the first survey was on electronics and I wasn't provided with the survey number because after I was not qualified for one survey it automatically directed me to that survey it was supposed to take 40 minutes so I don't know what the pay was but I figured 40 minutes while it probably pays about $2 the survey had some kind of glitches where the server was slow and it took a while to get to the next question after it would get to the next question it would do it again some questions went through smoothly at the end of the surveying it said could not be connected to server I waited I refreshed and I sent it on again and it says your answers have already been sent but I was never compensated for that survey which took an hour the next survey I did with on alcoholic beverages it was supposed to take 14 minutes 10 to 12 minutes into the survey it booted me out and said that I did not qualify for the survey thing that's not the first time it happened but it's the last time that it would happen for me I would like to be compensated for those two surveys and from now on I believe that this site should let you know at least 1/4 of the way into the survey whether or not you qualify don't get all of my answers and then right before the survey is to end in Pay tell me that I don't qualify like I said I am generally happy with this site but not today. Later on today I went back to the site to try to complete some more surveys as times are hard these days I just spent 10 minutes completing a 10-minute survey that got to the point where it ask me what my race was to verify my income for my family they only paid $0.60 I guess what happened after I completed the survey it said this survey is not a good thing I don't know what is wrong with this website but they are getting people's opinions for free paying them either cents on the dollar a Pang of nothing at all which is been my experience with the last three so I thought maybe the first two times was just a glitch but now I know they are basically stealing from people"

You should take them serious as the data collected is for a real company. The prices aren't always fair as far as the length and difficulty of the surveys though. Also it seems you get disqualified if you dont spend a predetermined amount of time on one question before answering. That's unreasonable bc not everyone reads at the same pace and finishing quickly shouldn't discredit your answers. I also find it unfair that sometimes you won't get a reward bc you are under review. Only to never get an answer as to why they let you finish but then didnt keep up their end of the deal so to speak. Not all of the companies they work with dk this but quite a few. I feel like that's what gives the negative aspects to the site."

You can see it below. I emailed them twice for this problem. And what is up with charging people a dollar to cash out 5$. You get rejected so many times. Guess they took my review to heart because now I have 23 surveys 'under review'. Kicker here!!!! My first surveys were fine. They do have good surveys. It will take you 2 months to get a good payout. So to add, I did start in October. I have been paid twice. First time it took me 3 days to receive my 5$ payout. The 2nd time, I cashed out 5.19$ then was told that I would be charged 1$. Do you have any idea what 1$ means?? I'm sure that you don't. 1$ can be the equivalent of 3 surveys because you have to do all the surveys that are 22 cents, 50 cents, 35 cents. That's up to 3 surveys I did and you wanna take that away from me. BTW I cashed out the first time in October then cashed out the day of my review. 16 days apart."

It was awesome for a quick 5 bucks, that's the only reason it gets 2 stars, otherwise it'd be 1 star.EDIT: Raised my review 1 star due to company reply...thanks."

On the other hand, the surveys take too long for an extremely low yield sometimes. Researchers should not be allowed to deny payment if you complete the survey and they don't like the answers. This doesn't happen often because I read the details before I start now and I just don't do surveys that don't credit immediately anymore. Problem solved. Also $0.17 for 19mins is ridiculous. Other than that.. Earn Haus is legit. If they increase the pay for these surveys, they would put all the other \"survey\" sites out of business."

My dashboard shows I have a whole lot of surveys that are available and yet all of them that I have tried to access go out and then immediately come back which means that I haven't been accepted and that is unacceptable to me! Why are the surveys on my dashboard if they are not going to allow me to take them? So the question prevails as to whether or not I'm actually going to be able to pay out on this app. That's the reason for the four stars which can immediately be changed to five stars if I could start getting surveys to actually take.

Of the 37 pended for review, 2 were paid a day later but those 2 were the first paid after a review and after 93 surveys. Per EarnHaus support, industry standard is to reconcile by the end of the following month, but again, none of my reviewed surveys were paid later for April or May. 14 are still pending review but odds are not in my favor that they'll pay. When contacted, support at EarnHaus paid on 5 where extended time was committed only to find quotas full \ud835\ude56\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67 the survey was completed instead of at the beginning.Very regularly the time expectation is grossly underestimated by the sponsor. I am using a tablet to speed up clicking that a mouse would be slower for. I had one survey that was expected to pay $0.65 for 15-18 min. The 100+ questions took me over 30min and resulted in a review (which so far means very low chance of payment) For fun, I tried a 3min survey for $0.10 and it took over 20min and went to review (which again most likely means no payment.) Each survey has an option to provide feedback or concerns, but none of mine were responded to when using that option. However, support when directly contact has been super fast and cordial and very thorough.If the percentage of surveys that pend for review drops significantly or if more of the reviewed surveys pay later, I'll definitely update this review..."
