They didn't tell me anything. I had to call and ask why my order is taking so long. That's why I wasn't able to secure another pair. The \"prompt\" refund, wasn't prompt at all. It took me calling for it be addressed. Which I gave more than a couple of weeks to be considerate. All other retailers were either already sold out of the given product. Or in the few weeks I let pass by before contacting them. The rest had sold. If they were more prompt and a better business. They would have did exactly what they said but weeks earlier. So I could have perhaps maybe found the product i was looking for."

Shipping from California??!!  Your home base is in the state I live PA.  You mean to tell me you have no warehouse in our big state??  I drove up to your store last year from Langhorne, PA and purchase a Cambridge receiver & Denon turn table. It's TEN days later and I'm still waiting for 2nd speaker of pair.

The item condition had now changed to \"seller refurbished\". Even though the detailed description still says \"certified factory refurbished\". By them changing the front page item condition from \"certified refurbished\" to \"seller refurbished\" it made the 20% off coupon invalid, They did this to avoid giving customers the coupon on the eligible items.

I asked how is this and I was told that an email went out shortly after I ordered the product that I needed to keep the box. I looked at all emails from WWS and not a word spoken about eh box.  Also I was told the the manufacturer tracked the product and box. I called Bose directly and they questioned as to why the box was required. Bose said it doesn\u2019t matter what box the product is in when the repair shop receives it in as long as the they receive the product. Bose also charged no shipping or fees to fix their product. Bose definitely stand behind their product!  I was planning on purchasing more Bose speakers from here but due to this last interaction I will be taking my business directly from Bose!"

When I opened the box (to make sure it was not damaged),  it had no cover for the speaker (yes it is supposed to have one and I pulled it completely out of the box to make sure it wasn't in there).  I called on four different days,  each time I was told they would call me back later that day after they contacted the Manufacturer.  The return phones calls never came.  On the 4th phone call (calls were at least two days apart each time)  a guy I spoke with once again said he would get a hold or the Manufacturer and see if he could get one.  He said if not,  I could simply return it.  The answer I expected as a customer was,  I'll get one sent out to you immediately and you'll have it in a few days.  The guy's I spoke with were always kind and never rude but the phone calls back never happened.  It has been over a week now with no grill cover and no phone call back.  This is a Christmas gift and it was a good deal.  Unfortunately the only other one I considered was no longer on sale (Black Friday pricing).  Now I'm stuck with either spending a lot more money on a similar item since the sales are off or give a gift missing parts that does not look right."

          "Contenu": "Bought from them Dynaudio Xeo2 speakers with the hub to connect speakers to computer. Didn\u2019t realize I also need another remote for everything to work, as the one which comes with he speakers does not work with the hub. Well, I needed this new remote ASAP, so I overnighted it. It arrived damaged. I contacted them, they told me to start the return process and only then they will overnight the replacement; even though the damage was NOT my fault, and I provided video to prove it. Well, it\u2019s been few days since I sent the broken one, but have yet to hear from them. Haven\u2019t received any emails with the new overnight tracking yet. So I\u2019ve had the new speakers for about 2 weeks now, but still can\u2019t use them yet because of that stupid remote. If you can, avoid these guys. If you have to deal with them, then, like in my case, you don\u2019t have a choice.P.S. Turns out the remote I had received initially was not the way you\u2019re supposed to receive it from the manufacturer. It was just a naked remote without batteries - not even in its box! I asked them how could this have ever happen, don\u2019t they see what they put in a box to be shipped to a customer?! Their answer was \u201cwe don\u2019t know\u201d.P.P.S. Eventually I received my remote, although going through their unprofessional representative on the phone only added to my unpleasant experience with this company."

I specifically told the guy I wanted these cordless Bluetooth headphones as I use them in my business & I have to be able to walk around while on the phone.He shipped me the wired JBL Reflect Mini In-Ear Headphones with In-Line Mic instead - which I can't use.After I received them I looked online - trying to make sense of what they'd done & found this ad which I screen-captured - which I can't seem to post here.I found, an ad for the \"wired\" headphones they \"erroneously\" sent & they were on sale for only $39.55.  So even though I didn't want these, if I had wanted them - they were hosing me on the price at $50.10.Nonetheless, they sent me the wrong ones so I called & the guy (who after much discussion and weasel-ly attempts to the contrary) said he'd give me a Return Authorization for a full refund & email me a label.  I also did a screen-shot of it & the Label's tracking info which I couldn't copy here.I sent the product back promptly - on 1/5/17.By the way, I went over to my local FedEx location and spoke with a guy there who I always deal with.  He told me that FedEx picked up the package at the post office where I dropped it and delivered it to another post office in PA.  They have no way to track it beyond their drop-off.  I believe I've done everything I could have in this case to comply with World Wide Stereo's RMA requirements can't get back my money from these people.  They conveniently keep saying they haven't received my returned product back yet.  Since they sent the label to me, how is that my fault?Next stop, Better Business Bureau, Social Media, then Amazon.Steve Parker"

          "Contenu": "In this review I want to give credit where credit is due, so I'll start outright by saying my initial experience with World Wide Stereo was quite good! During my process of shopping around for the home theater solution that was right for me, I spoke with lots of different sales people from lots of different stores and online retailers. I have to say, my conversations with worldwide stereo during this process were among the most enjoyable and helpful.I would even say that I was impressed with how quickly they shipped my home theater system to me. All said and done I think I got it in like three days.However, once I got the theater system set up, that's when I first experienced my first issue. Now, just so you know, the system I bought is legitimately a plug and play system--you really have to try to mess it up. Well, what happened was one of the rear surround speakers was defective. It never worked correctly from the get-go. The other identical rear speaker works beautifully. So I contacted worldwide stereo to get the problem taken care of. When I told them about the defective speaker, the first question I got asked was if I kept the box that it was shipped in. I quickly answered no. I never save packaging for items that I purchase, with the exception of Apple products because of their high resell value and because there's often things in the packaging that I might use later, like extra cords or chargers.Anyway, when I said that I did not have the original box, the customer service representative told me that they would have to charge me 15% for a restocking fee. I thought that was very unusual, as I do a lot of online shopping, including all kinds of purchases have electronics and speakers, etc. The representative went on to say that it's industry standard practice. I reminded the representative that were talking about a defective product. It's not that I didn't like the color or some thing--the product I paid for didn't work out of the box. The representative stated that that did not matter and provided me a link to the part of the website that explained returns and exchanges. I ended up reading the entire webpage, end it seems to indicate the defective items are handled differently than simple returns or exchanges. I still don't think their website makes it clear enough that when they sell defective products to customers that the customer is responsible to pay fees if they don't have all the original packaging. This is an absurd customer service practice. I quickly went to several of their competitor websites to review their return policy and found nothing like it. So much for an industry standard.That all took place on a Saturday, and then I got a call from them on Monday. The lady that called and spoke to me basically treated me like I was out of my mind for thinking that they should take care of everything in regards to getting a working product sent out to me. She was argumentative, and frequently cut me off while I was speaking. At one point I asked myself, am I a customer here that spent hundreds of dollars? She's treating me like I'm trying to rip them off, when in fact it was them that sold me a product that didn't work. I'm simply just asking for the product I paid for, and not be charged fees for a box. Are you kidding?I will not be spending another dollar at World Wide stereo. I will purchase directly through the manufacturer, or from another third-party."

Luckily it does. I want to complain about it but I read about other customers bad experienced with your customer service. Your company courier, in this case Fedex, is not good.  I saw it on my security camera that the Fedex delivery guy just drop it on the front door without care before knocking on the door. I hope that you take an extra care on any fragile order by placing it on a box not just ship it as it is. I have ordered online several time with other vendors, e.g. B&H, they place all orders on a B&H box and they really put extra care on their delivery. I don't recommend this online vendor specially when ordering fragile items."

That is to say, I cannot leave the switch in the position of \"IT\", and I have to keep it with my finger all the time when I am on the phone.

At least, I have not received any reply even though I have returned it to them.  At the same time, When I feedback the problem to the seller, I have no idea why they can not deal with this immediately. And they told me they were willing to re-ship a new one until they received the headphone I returned. Why they cannot deal with the problem while they receive the feedback of problem from customer? So, the problem of item from seller have to be borne by customer and make customer have to wait for more time? The seller cannot deal with the problem immediately? One month passed, I did not get any reply. At the same time, it also delayed my use due to their distrust of their customers, I think."

I tried calling and emails and couldn't get a response from Korus and then called World Wide back to see if they could help. The next salesman told me that he would call Korus and get back to me. I didn't hear back for a few days and called again. They said they are still trying and give them a little longer. I never heard back from them.

          "Contenu": "I had an order cancelled by WWS for apparently no reason. As I read through the Trustpilot reviews, I see multiple people experiencing the same problem with WWS. I'm now one of many. The similarities:* Placed an order for a not-inexpensive item ($900).* Order is cancelled the next day, for no apparent reason.* I logged into my bank, and the transaction shows as having been fully processed -- i.e., it's not in a \"pending\" state, but is in with other fully executed transactions.* Called WWS Customer Service (CS), who said that she can't see (in her system) why the bank cancelled the transaction, but that it's in a pending state at the bank, and will \"drop off shortly\" -- and that I need to contact my bank to find out what happened. - I informed her that the transaction was not in a pending state, but rather has been fully processed, and so won't be \"dropping off\" without further action. - She replied that WWS will process a reversal on the transaction, and I will see a credit. Okay, fine -- but that means the bank didn't reject it, right? - She tells me (again) that I need to contact my bank to find out what happened. - She states that the purchase cannot be reinstated, I will have to go in and place a new order, and recommends that I use Amazon or PayPal to make the payment next time. (That's not a problem, but I want to understand WHAT HAPPENED. I'm an engineer; we need to do a root-cause analysis before trying the same experiment again.)* So I called the bank, who confirmed that the transaction has been fully processed, \"the vendor has the money from this transaction,\" and that there is no issue from the bank's end. (Minor note: two weeks earlier, I'd tried this same transaction at WWS and the bank DID reject that purchase, because it was a \"new vendor that I'd never done business with before.\" They put in an approval for this vendor, and a couple of weeks later I went back and processed the order I'm speaking about here.)* I called WWS CS back, and was told that \"credit card orders can be rejected for any number of reasons -- address problems and phone number problems are two very common reasons for orders being rejected.\" I have neither of those -- the address is correct, same address for billing and shipping, phone number is correct, all the planets are aligned. - I told him that there was no problem with the order at the bank's end, and that the bank says that the vendor has the money for this transaction. - He then acknowledges that it was WWS who cancelled the order, not the bank (this is the first time that WWS actually acknowledged that THEY cancelled the order -- which means that my call to the bank was a waste of my time, and the bank's time). He assured me that a reversal on the credit card transaction will be done \"immediately.\" (I'll be checking on that...) - I asked why WWS cancelled the order, and was told that they have the prerogative to cancel any order they want, but that I can place a new order and use Amazon or PayPal to check out. - I don't disagree that the vendor can cancel any order it wants, but I also want to know on what basis was my order cancelled. I'm told that, for my protection, they can't tell me that. (And again, I can't disagree with the \"for your protection\"; they have no idea whether the person they're talking to really is the credit card owner. So, no issue there.) - I informed him that an order being cancelled for no apparent reason does not build confidence that a second order will be processed correctly, and that I will need to go to another vendor. He replied that he understood my reason for wanting to go elsewhere; I think he might have even preferred that outcome for some reason.The people I talked with -- the operator and two CS people -- were all very nice. I did feel that I got a bit of a run-around by first telling me that I need to contact my bank to find out what happened, and then later being told that it really was WWS who cancelled the order.What really troubles me here -- and the reason I decided to post this review (and in this level of detail) -- is that the experiences of several other reviewers on here were nearly identical to mine: WWS blames the bank or credit card, but these are credit cards that have been used for years and are working fine elsewhere. WWS gives no explanation for the mysterious cancellations. WWS recommends placing a new order and using Amazon or PayPal.In a way, I feel I am lucky, as I also see there are numerous cases of late deliveries on products (although the shippers are also running late these days as a result of COVID) as well as delivered products that are somehow damaged or discolored. This is a gift, so I obviously want it to be in \"giftable condition\" when it arrives. I placed a new order directly from the manufacturer, rather than from WWS.I'll update this review as I get more information...."

Needles to say the Neo PSU was jostled in every which direction and did sustain some damage to the front lower left hand corner of the face. I had to unscrew the face off and attempt to bend the corner back into a somewhat straight position, didn\u2019t have much luck. The back side of the unit also sustained similar damage.I did not return it as it\u2019s functional albeit damaged and needed a phono stage ASAP. I hope that future orders will come securely packed as they always have..."

It felt like WWS was trying to pressure me into accepting a 75$ refund, which for 350$ speakers seems unacceptable and of course I am going to try and send the photos and exchange my speaker for one that doesn't have a gaping puncture on the side. But otherwise my experience was great! Fair prices, quick shipping, and customer service responded in 24 hours."

I was surprised that WWS does have a notification system in place for this type of a situation. Employees that answer the phones are not rude, but are not pleasant, they give the impression that they do not want to answer the phone and help customers.

She also explained the reason for confusion is that Energy is a subsidiary of Klipsch. She offered for a representative to contact me from Klipsch if I had any concerns about the quality of the product I received. I refused the offer as I am satisfied with the quality of the product I received, I just felt like it was not as advertised, again by a third party. So I am updating my rating solely because wwstereo cared enough to contact me promptly to address any concerns. I will consider ordering from them in the future."

The order consisted of three items, two of which shipped from Pennsylvania, arrived via FedEx Freight earlier without any issues.  The third item shipped from California.  A delay with FedEx picking up the package resulted in the delivery date being moved from Thursday to Friday before Labor Day.  The delivery address is a Call Center for my company and handles FedEx Freight and Express shipments all day.  Since the package shipped as Home Delivery, it didn't get delivered with our daily Freight or Express runs.  The driver made a false claim that he made an unsuccessful delivery attempt at 5:20.  I called FedEx and made arrangments for another attempt on Tuesday after Labor Day via FedEx Freight.  Despite this, the package was delivered on Saturday and left unsecured at the drop-off location.  I appreciate that World Wide Stereo is not responsible for FedEx's lack of professionalism and failure to follow instructions.  However, the choice to ship my item as Home Delivery resulted in the package not arriving along with the regular deliveries that Friday.  Communication and consideration would have gone a long way to mitigate the hassle I had to go through just to receive my item.Thank you."

When the television arrived, i was going to do my inspection. The driver told me that my inspection instructions were incorrect, and that i just needed to sign the paperwork. I disagreed, so he made a phone call to his manager. Seems like there is miscommunication between the shipping company and World Wide Stereo.  Third issue was that the tv was damaged at the corner. That was very disappointing. I did notify the customer service of World Wide Stereo. This time around they were very helpful with my issue. The communication was clear, and the issue was resolved.  I did receive a new tv the following week without any issues. The driver did not know that he had to pick up the damaged tv until he called his supervisor. World Wide Stereo really did try to fix the issue, and worked with me so that i would be satisfied with my purchase. Few things kept me from writing a better rating. Maybe my experience with World wide Stereo might be better next time IF i decide to buy more items for my entertainment room."

I\u2019ll certainly be looking to World Wide Stereo for other system options and upgrades such as my speakers and amplifiers.

This language enriches our soul, allows us to time travel back to moments of intense personal meaning, and give us the gift of solitude in a world that seems crazy by most measures.A well designed and installed HiFi system powerfully connects you with the artistry and passion of musicians the world over that have dedicated their lives to expression using sound as their medium.The people at World Wide Stereo have dedicated their lives to enriching the places you live, work and play in, and are exceptional at their craft.I urge you to let them show you how they can help you too.My finest - JBevier"
