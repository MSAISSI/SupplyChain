Customer services is almost non-existent. I could not recommend this website less and I would caution anyone from buying from them."

          "Contenu": "I\u2019ve waited a few months to provide a review for my computer. Customer experience was limited but no issues when in contact from a support rep. Around 2 months after purchasing my custom rig, my computer began blue screening. This started happening around September. After the first blue screen, it began to slowly increase in frequency, up to a few times a day. Going over the dump files and talking to some outside sources of what a potential issue may be, came to a trial and error period. Began pushing and reseating connectors in the computer, which did not work. Eventually made my way to reseating my ram. This fixed the crashing for a few weeks, then began again. The crashing has continued till this day, months after the purchase. I have reseated my ram around 5 times, which allows it to run without issues for a couple weeks until it crashes again. Streaming my screen via discord has become choppy and I feel the computer is struggling. With the components I choose and the price I paid, this is unacceptable. Funny enough, I had two other friends who purchased custom rigs from CyberpowerPC, which one of them began having booting issues within the first 2 weeks, another where all games would crash and some blue screens. The two individuals purchased their computers roughly a few months from each other and have since sent them back, one is more recent but the other one two almost 2 months to get back, with no help from the CyberpowerPC support team. This will be the last computer is purchase from this company, I have since my early purchase of 2013, recommended this company to many others. Never again. I\u2019m not sending my computer in to be left with nothing for months, horrible response time and with terrible quality control. Either the parts are defective and or refurbished but with a premium price tag. I\u2019ll be replacing parts with my own money even after spending over $4,400."

Countless calls to support to try and help with this. I was denied and flagged for fraud after using a credit card. Fine, that makes sense, I did not mind. I then have to wait quite some time due to personal reasons before I tried using my debit card, which was then still flagged for fraud and the order was denied. I then had to wait longer to transfer money to PayPal only for the website to tell me that I was not able to purchase this configuration through PayPal despite being told that my only options are to not use a credit card or use PayPal. They had so many sale advertizements, but they will gatekeep new people from purchasing their wares due to a lack of trust and flexibility. I will never get a computer from them again. I had to resort to having the people that helped with my first computer, buy it for me. Then I sent them the money through PayPal as repayment. Horrible experience, get your wares from some place else."

Instead of doing any repairs or replacements, CyberPowerPC rep, Victor, continued to have me take my PC apart and perform workarounds to extend the life of my GPU.

A gift card and a graphics are completely different. Now I'm stuck with a GPU that black screens and crashes frequently with no support from the place I bought it from."

However over the space of the next 6 months the same problem happened twice. Look at the reviews on YouTube.as a parent that didn't really know much about pcs, the general opinions I found was quite similar. Really good specs for the money but all other components poor and cheap quality"

The idea that this was not identified before shipping out the computer my way blows my mind.

They said I could send it back but I would need to provide everything to do that and if something happened in transit I would be at fault for that. So I tried to find a work around and no matter who I talked to I got the same answer. The very next week one of the ports on the video card went out and was sending corrupted data to my monitor. I called again and still no assistance. How hard can it be to send an empty box for the product they sent me. To you I ask this, how is that a good customer experience?"

Either way, CyberPower seems determined to keep me in the dark. They have refused to cancel the order or spec a new machine to send to me while their shipment snafu is worked out, which is disappointing to say the least. The PC itself might be fantastic---I'm a repeat customer and they've been great in the past---but their customer service is non-existent at best.

Mailed in this state, the water cooler torqued on the mounts and bent the tabs.  Fans did not work, and RGB was not set-up out of the box,  the IO did not align properly due to the chassis damage.  My request to CPPC was simple, please send me new chassis and I will transfer the components myself.  I did not want to send the system back, I did not ask for a partial refund, I asked for a chassis and I would do the work.  In the month since, I have not received any response to my warranty request or any subsequent follow-up.  I have since bought my own chassis, moved everything and properly assembled it myself ensuring it would work\u2026something CPPC should have done in the first place.  Terrible attention to detail, poor quality control and the worst customer service/tech support I have ever experienced.

          "Contenu": "The desktop was dead on arrival. Regardless of paying extra for expanding foam protection to keep components in place, the video card was apparently too heavy and needed further support. The unit arrived with the PCI slot (supporting the video card) damaged. The PCI connection was spread apart enough to disallow a connection. The motherboard was also probably damaged. The weight of this card warrants extra support to avoid this issue in the future.Afterward, their support team took a couple of days to supply a return shipment label. After shipped back, I was told it might take weeks before return. Thankfully, they did ship it back within about a week after they received it.My biggest complaint: I originally paid extra for 3 day shipping, but it was sent back UPS Ground. The tracking had an arrival date of August 31st. Understandably, the shipment was to FL during Hurricane Idalia... It moved through less than a day and expected a possible extra day to deliver. Well, Friday came, and then came notice it wouldn't be delivered until Sept 5th (because of worldwide weather), sorry... that's BS.Bottom line... Cyberpower should still have honored the 3 day expedited shipping I paid extra for the first time. And under the storm conditions, UPS shouldn't have been delayed more than a day. The order was placed on July 25th and it's now Sept 2nd and I'm still waiting on UPS to deliver!FWIW. This is my third computer ordered from Cyberpower, and was very happy with the first two orders, but a bit dissatisfied this time. The return time on a damaged unit received in shipment should receive better support and priority."

There are noticeably screws missing from fans that were to both hold the fans to the frame and the fans to the radiator.  I paid extra for wiring but found that some of the wires were ran between the case frame and the cover panels such that the wires were under compression when the cover to the computer case was closed.  The remaining wires were ran properly simply by running the wires through the slots in the frame provided.  I have reached out to Cyberpower, sent them pictures, but they have not offered to do anything about the problem.  Outside of that, its a good computer, but I selected to pay multiple upcharges to have this computer custom built and feel like I have been taken advantage of."

IT service... 3 stars. - Nice people but can't remote connect so you have to do all the work and describe what you see.Return policy... 1 star. I wanted to switch out a part. Not possible. I wanted to exchange it for a new build and pay the difference. Not possible. I really tried to work with them but the only option was for ME to pay shipping cost for their defective PC.EDIT:Response to me review... 1 star. You can tell they really care about my problems. LoL"

The build also said they would include three more Corsair fans. This is where things went wrong. To get all eight fans into the case they installed the cooler with a push / pull configuration. This was OK, but because the Corsair node only has room for six fans, which control the fan speed, they wired the other two fans from the power supply. This caused these other two fans to operate at full speed. Very noisy. They also put the \"tach\" wire from the Corsair cooler onto the AIO header. After contacting Corsair, they said the tach wire should go onto the CPU \"fan\" header. This wire is for telling the motherboard that there is cooling to the CPU. Then in bios, I reset the CPU fan from \"ignore\" to Monitor. I realize they were trying to include all the fans that were ordered, but they should have only added one more, not three."

          "Contenu": "The Good:-Computer runs great (now). I got a AMD Ryzen 5 7600 and 3060ti with 32GB DDR5 at 6000mhz with a 1tb NVME on an Asrock Micro MB with a hefty 850w. Computer runs quietly and cold with only one fan and the AIO CPU cooler.The Bad:-LOOONG time to get it built and shipped (more than a month), annoying when the receipt said only a few days.-RAM and CPU were not compatible at the speed it was at. Had to lower the RAM mhz to 5200 in BIOS because the 7600 can't reliably handle 6000.-Deal made it seem they were upgrading the RAM to 6000 over 4800, but it was just actually 4800mhz RAM that was overclocked.-PC was crashing every few minutes when under load because of this problem. So much for quality control.-No extra fans? Would think for the price paid they would at least throw in some fans for the intake, but no. I know it's an add-on you can pay for, but dude, fans are so cheap, and how can you send out a computer WITH OUT AN INTAKE FAN.All in all, I'm not really disappointed in the machine itself because the parts are good, but I've built my own machines my whole life, this being my first pre-built. I would rather build my own machine again next time knowing what I get is going to work properly. Having crashes right from the start because a company can't check if the RAM works properly is an absolute no. They need to educate their workers better."

          "Contenu": "Cyberpower sent a system to me that was delivered on August 9th.  There was no documentation or check list included and no AC power cord for the power supply.  There was also packing material so badly jammed between the GPU and cooler that it could not be removed without manually removing the Styrofoam from inside the packing material by hand.  While a tech support rep guided me (using a video link) through how best to disassemble the packing material, it was only because the material could not otherwise be removed without removing the cooler and GPU that he recommended removing the stryofoam. The power cord is still missing.  The tech support group at Cyberpower advised against using the cord from my existing system and of course using a cord other than the original would make relying on the warranty of the manufacturer of the power supply doubtful.  I have been told that it will ship in 7-10 days. The problem is that the company warranty only allows returns for a 30 day period during which a return can be done without paying a restocking fee, and a further 15 days to request any return.  The longer it takes to correct the failure to deliver the cord, the less time it allows to use the computer and determine whether there are any defects that would warrant returning it.  I have ordered at least 8 computers from system integrators over the years from several venders.  I have had defective parts and worked through warranty repairs.  But I have never before received a system lacking a component essential to using it.  I also never received a system that did not include some form of confirming checklist by the builder or a shipping department confirming all items included in the box.  I still have no clue how the system runs or how well the airflow was set up in the case.  System integrators cannot reasonably prevent a system from occasionally containing a defective part.  They should never just leave parts out altogether.  The experience has not inspired confidence."

          "Contenu": "Dear Sir, Ma'am, or whatever misguided pronoun you have chosen,I am writing regarding the order above and my displeasure with the condition in which it arrived.I'm including pictures attached to the email.I am a quadrapleic disabled veteran.  I had a 17-year career as a Data Center Hardware Engineer after leaving the U. S. Army before becoming 100% disabled by MS.  I'm not writing for a \"Thanks for your service\" or for pity.  I write this so you'll  know I know my tech but need hands to do the hardware for me.Once I received my order, I scheduled some tech friendly friends to come and install it for me.  Once it was powered on, the system booted successfully.  Because I no longer have the use of my hands, I use the Quadstick disability controller to operate my PC.Upon reviewing the devices installed in the system, I discovered the 8 TB 3.5\" inch hard drive I ordered was not showing up.  This prompted a service call.  My techs worked with Adam and looked to troubleshoot the issue.  Adam asked for us to remove the right panel of the case.Once removed, the Corsair 5000D Airflow Case has an additional doorway that swings on hinges revealing the inner parts of the case.  We discovered the 8 TB drive was installed, but was not connected.  Now my PC installation became a PC repair, which the techy friends I had hired charged me additionally.Also, I found the cable management in the system to be a mess.  Even though the  Cyberpower tech that built my PC used cable tension sleeves on some of the cables, he/she/it has actually blocked the use of all three SSD drive trays thereby eliminating my ability to use them for future storage expandability.  I would need to pay a tech to completely rewire the PC just to use one of the trays in the future.I spent $3600 on this PC to be \"Future proof\".  So I wouldn't need to buy a new computer in the next 10 years or so.I had initially planned on upgrading my system storage with SSD's as the higher ratings become more affordable.  Though my motherboard has 2 other unused M.2 slots, the larger capacity M.2 drives are prohibitively expensive currently.I have neither the time nor the energy to have people come and box this thing up and ship it back to you to have it wired correctly.I do think it should be discounted since I had to pay my installers significantly more than I had planned since they had to actually repair my system instead of just installing it for me.  That and the blocking of my SSD trays cripples my storage options for the future and that's just unforgivable.Cyberpower PC's response?  Tough luck  Seeya!.  (Essentially)All in all, I designed a great system in their configurator.  They just took a dump on cable management and on customer service.I'll be reaching out to all of my techy friends and they'll be reaching out to all of their techy friends on social media that Cyberpower PC should be avoided.  I'll recommend a competitor like  Alienware, Digital Storm, or Falcon Northwest."

The unboxing was satisfying, quick, and the machine had no issues with heavy use over the course of 2-3 years. The second machine; however, has been a massive pain with issues and multiple support tickets. The machine was much more powerful with a 3000 series RTX, and it worked very well when it was in working order. A couple months after heavy use the machine randomly had hardware errors that caused my monitors to stop getting feedback from the GPU, and since the CPU does not have integrated graphics the machine was practically unusable. My setup has worked flawlessly for many years and I have no reason to believe the machine issues are linked to any peripherals I am using, and even while I was troubleshooting I was able to run 4 other machines using the same setup without any problems. I worked with support and ended up spending $600 to ship the whole machine back to them in California for it to be fixed, and within 48 hours of the machine back in my hands the same issue was still happening, joy! I worked with support again and discovered that the issue goes away entirely with the use of a different graphics card. Through many months of troubleshooting, unseating hardware, and headaches, the problem still exists only with the GPU that came with the original build. I requested a replacement since none of diagnostic tests provided any useful information and I was told that I shouldn't assume the GPU is the issue and they would send it right back to me if it didn't test broken -- but my machine was broken when I sent it to them and they sent it back broken, so at this point who is to blame if it comes back and still doesn't work? Needless to say, I have gotten tired of constantly dealing with a faulty machine shipped to me twice by the company. I don't mean to be entirely negative for this review because the company impressed me enough the first time around to purchase a second build, and it must also be mentioned that support is very kind and patient when troubleshooting; however, I will not personally use this company for any future builds since I can no longer trust both the hardware they are sending out and the maintenance team's ability to truly diagnose and fix issues. I hope if you go with this company your experience is like my first machine and not like my second, but if it is the latter don't say I didn't warn you."

I even got an email from a tech who stated the ETA and offered to help should I have any questions. After that is when it proceeded to go downhill. About 3 weeks had passed since my purchase so I went to the website portal to check the status and the information on there was not helpful at all, barely stating that I had even made a purchase. As I remembered the date I selected when making the purchase, I knew the date was less than a week out. I emailed the tech and was told the motherboard was on backorder and it would be another 2 or 3 weeks until they'd get it in. I know this is out of the company's control but maybe have a system in place to communicate this to the customer, without the customer having to reach out first, and to offer a substitution or something if they did not want to wait. I acknowledged the update from the tech and proceeded to wait, checking periodically for an update on the website. It was, I believe, the day before the date the backordered ETA was pushed to when I saw the ETA had been delayed even further and would be another week or so longer. Again, communicating this to the customer would be helpful. I decided to just wait until the new ETA date and see what happens. The date came and went without anything getting updated on the website so I decided to reach out to the tech again. I get back a largely blank page but with a simple date which it should ship by. Nice to know the motherboard came in, one can assume. From here it was picked up by UPS and I got an email with a tracking number. No idea why it proceeded to sit in a California warehouse for another week before being delivered but I feel like that's more a UPS issue than yours. At this point, I am just so overjoyed I finally have my PC in my possession. Packaging was mostly pretty good but something I found extremely odd was the paperwork and extra cables came in a completely random motherboard box which is a shame because I would have loved to display the actual box for the motherboard I am using. The cherry on top for this whole ordeal is after getting everything set up and some games installed, when I launched any given game, the whole PC would crash resulting in an error blue screen a few of the times. I had to troubleshoot online to try to figure out why the gaming PC I just purchased couldn't play any game I launched. Currently it seems underclocking the CPU has at least made it so I can play games but this should've been noticed if the PC was tested in any way based solely on the operating temperature. In summary, I would say the company needs to work on the service aspect of the process giving the customers more accurate updates on what's going on and maybe a bit more time testing the unit."

          "Contenu": "I saw that CyberPowerPC for their Labor Day Special was offering a good deal on building a PC with them. Having never used them to build a PC I was hesitant, but read some reviews and so I opted to build with them instead of assembling it myself, especially considering saving time and money because of the sale. I received the PC a little slower than I would have liked - almost 3 weeks, but upon opening my PC I was disappointed to see the first thing wrong - I ordered a PC with 3 RGB Corsair fans in front, as well as ordering the Corsair 4000D Airflow Case with the perforated front for air flow to be able to see the fans - the image on their website showed this case with my selection. Cyberpower PC sent the build inside the 4000D Tempered Glass Mid-Tower ATX case with the solid metal plate in front, obscuring view of the RGB fans, and not providing the airflow and aesthetic I wanted. So either the photo on the website was not accurate or they used the wrong case. Easy fix, but I had to pay extra to buy a replacement plate from Corsair to get what I wanted. This was the first disappointment.I also paid extra for the \"professional\" cable management, which was done well enough everywhere else, except in my PSU. The power supply I chose was fully modular, but they left the entire mess of unnecessary cables plugged it that aren't being occupied at all - they could have removed them, and the wiring will take me time to unravel, remove and then re-assemble - a service I specifically paid them more to take care of. Starting to feel more disappointed.I also received two game collection vouchers with this purchase, and one of them was well expired by the time I received my PC. Definitely expired before they had even shipped it. To top that all off - Cyberpower PC promised a $50 prepaid American Express Gift Card with the purchase. Upon opening the gift card and activating/checking the balance online, the card had already been used in an online gambling website, and had $4 left on it. I emailed Cyberpower about this and the other issues and was not replied to for over a week. I never received an email back, so I decided I had given them enough time and I called and was connected to Ryan at CyberPower PC on 10/10/22 at 12:25PM EST to find a solution to the issue, or to see if I should contact American Express. Ryan seemed to have 0 customer service experience and told me he would call me back - which he never did. I let it go because by this point, I can paint a picture of Cyberpower PC's incompetence and apathy, even if the gift card balance issue is not related to their service.As for the build itself, it works the way I need it to, apart from the GPU developing coil whine a few weeks after I received the PC. However, the building process, specials/sales disappointments, and customer service left a lot to be desired and I was left disappointed and unsatisfied with my experience with Cyberpower PC."

On getting the PC back the expanding foam in the PC case damaged the motherboard or video card, and I had to troubleshoot it myself, again.Edit: So after a few months the power supply failed, it was so loud when it failed it was as if I took a hammer and hit the hood my of car as hard as I could. I requested an rma, and after some troubleshooting they took it on RMA.Not an issue, things happen. But when I got it back the computer didnt work, no video. Plug monitor into motherboard, and got video. Video card issue. During ship back from RMA the foam they used inside the PC case bent the video card. I called to make another RMA. Sent pictures. You can clearly see it's bent. I re-seat the card after OK from tech support. It starts to work.The computer turns off after 60 seconds every time. The power supply port on the graphics card seems damaged, if you touch the power going into the graphics card even very gently the PC turns off and fans run 100%. I buy a 90-degree adapter for the power cable. Seems to work to keep pressure off the cable. But still disappointing,  I am not happy at all, but cancel the RMA. The PCI-E slot, or the graphics card are bent. Functional  Been 2 months now since I got it back and only happened one more time.On to the original review.After a few bad reviews, I was worried about how the PC would come. But after a week with it, I'm fully satisfied.I bought the roughly 2350$ 13900k 4070ti base system. But after changing to the 990 Pro NVME and some other small items quickly became $2890A few main issues I was concerned about were damage, bios being configured correctly, proper seating of the CPU cooler (thermals) and fans not being plugged into the motherboard, and getting direct voltage.So after going through the PC thermals are great peaking at 80, and 60 ambient temps. Case fans are connected to the board so not always running at 100%, also the fan curve was just fine. Ram was running at correct speed, but I don't understand timings and voltage, so don't ask.Oh yea, zero damage. To remove expanding foam I had to pull a few power connectors. And that stuff was in there good, I had to break it off to get it out. But all good. No issues or debris.The keyboard they gave me for cheap is terrible. The mouse I paid an extra 14 dollars for is also terrible. Skip them and like someone else said reduce the e-waste because you will throw them out.Ordered on May 17, and received it on April 11. They told me ahead of time it would take 2-4 weeks for production, so if you minus the 4 days for UPS to deliver is very good.I didn't select a specific brand of 4070 ti I got a gigabyte eagle oc. Which I would have been happy with several brands. So I lucked out, this is one I'm happy with.The only thing I wish I would have changed would have to choose a name-brand power supply. It does work fine, but online many people complain they commonly are a failure issue. And since I spent $2900 I trusted they would sell me a good brand. If they told you what brand they put in the system by default I would have changed it for a mere $40-50 more, which is nothing compared to the total. As I said it's running just fine, even with my GPU and CPU pulling 500-600 watts for a bit. No crashing or anything like that."

Also, a few of the cables were not plugged into the motherboard, and were not even in the right vicinity on the motherboard (so I had to undo wires and move them across the motherboard to the right place).

The main issue I have/had is that the wiring job was very sloppy, and when I say sloppy I mean way too much wiring just crammed behind the mother board and around/underneath the fans. The only reason I noticed is because I had to troubleshoot one of the radiator fans on the liquid cooling system. 1 out of 4 fans would not turn on. BIOS settings looked correct so I had to check the wiring. Sure enough, there was a bad connection where a section of wire near the base of one of the connectors was essentially folded over itself I think it wasn't making contact with one or more of the connector pins. For now, I just unbent it and that seemed to work as long as we don't move the computer a whole bunch or nothing like that. Hence why I might need to just redo the wiring. For an almost $3k computer I thought I would be paying for quality manufacturing but it was obviously very rushed and sloppy. I'm happy with my purchase, it works, but I hope I don't run into any more issues due to the wiring issues."

Unfortunately they seem to cut corners with customer service (Both times I contacted them the representatives were very curt and eager to end the interaction), don't update their storefront to reflect out of stock parts, and nickel and dime you for industry standard things. Like charging for foam protection for the inside of your PC during shipping, and not double-boxing for shipping. My shipment arrived so beat up its a miracle the PC wasn't damaged (although that's on UPS). It also clearly displayed what was inside the box, which makes it a tempting target for theft. I also paid for their professional wiring service (why aren't all PCs \"professionally wired\"?) and the cable management is about as messy as it could be...

You will have to remove the video card to get the expansion foam out. At least with the case I purchased. Since they also charge extra for doing the wiring correctly, which is also seriously wrong! The wiring can get so tight that it will pull apart in places you don't expect it to. So beware to check every connection before boot up. Especially the adapter connector to the video card. The 4080 I opted for used this and I found the adapter cable had come loose upstream, this caused the video card to not function properly. After reseating all the cables it worked fine. So just be aware. Otherwise the PC is working great and the turn around and build time was as stated."

I phoned customer support and was told he could install another video card which I accepted so the order could be completed. Upon checking the CP website, I noticed that you were including a 4 TB disk drive and a keyboard and mouse free with any custom order. I recontacted customer service and requested these items be included in my order. I was told they would not change my order to include them but I could cancel my order and reorder to get them. My computer had not been built at this point but I was facing a deadline to receive it before leaving in a planned vacation. The customer service tech knew about my deadline and that if I reordered, I would not receive it in time. If he could change my order for the video card, he could have added these free items. I am very unhappy about this and feel that he took advantage of my situation to save a few bucks. My computer did arrive on time and looks great."

          "Contenu": "The physical build quality is great and the PC was packaged perfectly for shipping. My only complaint is that it seems the hardware was not configured to take advantage of the components purchased. The motherboard is low quality (I blame ASRock for this and not Cyberpower) so trying to run the memory which is rated at 6000mghz at the rated speed is not possible. The system is incredibly unstable. So the memory was set to be downclocked to 4800MGhz because enabling XMP causes the system to be unstable. As I said this is a problem with ASRock but I think Cyberpower should NOT be selling boards that are not compatible with the other components because it is very misleading to the customer to purchase one thing and have those parts hadnicaped because Cyberpower didn't tell us that the motherboard they say was \"OC Certified\" isn't actually certified it seems."

The third I ordered could have been installed elsewhere in PC and they sell matching fans that would have fit where they put the random one\"Professional wiring\" was a joke, if this was the \"extra\" level I'd hate to see what regular level was that didn't cost extra. I don't think they did quality control like they said they did because upon starting PC two of the stock fans that were plugged into daisy connection were running weird (making noise when they ran).  I took these two out and ran the extra fan I ordered directly to MOBO and it resolved the issue.So, TLDR, shipping date they sell you on is misleading, customer service isn't great, pro wiring and air flow is a joke (this is something extra you pay for), but PC pricing and options is good. It seems to be running fine now that I did driver updates and fan control."

          "Titre": "Should have never passed QC",
          "Contenu": "The Bad First: Wiring for one of the case fans was wedged between the motherboard back plate and the chassis, sandwiching the wire across the onboard display port.  The only way to fix this is to remove the motherboard and all components that are attached to it, re-route the wire and reseat the motherboard. This is unacceptable and shows poor quality control procedures within the company.  How did this pass quality control? The top of the case was also not screwed down and secured nor did they supply me with a single spare case screw so I could not even screw it down myself.  Not a single case part or screw was supplied with the system, no motherboard manuals, no spare parts.  Nothing.  Very disappointed in the quality control from CyberPower PC on this particular build.  Okay the good:  The system was operational and I had no problems with it turning on or not working properly.   The system is clean and the wiring is neat.  They did supply me with my extra case fans \"That I purchased extra as a kit of 5\" that would not fit.  It only needed 2 of the 5 so I have 3 of them as spares.  I called in to the tech support team and they were very helpful and kind and said they would send me case screws so I can secure the top of the case.  As far as the motherboard squishing a wire in the backplate? Well for that I would have to pack it up and send it back.  I'm just going to leave the wire as is as I don't plan to use the onboard display port.  The other workings of the system seemed to be installed correctly such as: The coolant CPU temps, FAN Control and LED.  I didn't have to rewire and connect things up to the motherboard that were forgotten or anything like that.  I would have loved to have given CyberPowerPC a 5 star review as I've purchased 4 rigs from them throughout the years but not securing the case and the wire issue suggests that they skipped QC at least on this build.  I just can't give more than 3 for that."

          "Titre": "Good PC with ALOT of hassle!",
          "Contenu": "OK, let me start by saying that the computer I ordered was well-built. However, the issues I experienced were with the graphics card. Once I received my new PC from cyber power PC. I unpackaged everything made all connections plugged monitor into display port on graphics card. And turned on system for first time. The screen was black. Number code indicator on motherboard was a 97. Looking that up it indicated that graphics card was not communicating with motherboard. Attempted to reseat the GPU into motherboard thinking this was the issue still no display. Luckily I had an older PC and was able to remove graphics, card and test in other PC , still same issue with black screen. Plugged in old graphics card from other PC into new PC and that one worked just fine. Called their RMA, which was fast to get a hold of and was able to get the RMA process started. Returned that graphics card as soon as UPS shipping label was printed.  Took about three weeks for the RMA process. Received New graphics card and installed it and everything is now working as it should. Now after almost a month and a half from placing my order until receiving RMA graphics card I now have a working PC. Doing research, I found that this was not a one off issue that this actually happens quite often with cyber power PC.  Some of the explanation that was given is that something must\u2019ve broken on the GPU during shipping. Even though I paid for the extra packaging and care for shipping my item, I still received it in this sort of condition. Also, another thing of note is that the graphics card maker provides a mounting bracket to support GPU and also the case, which is the NV7 also provides a mounting bracket for the GPU to be supported, and neither one of the mounts were used.  I also had suggested to CyberPowerPC PC that when they ship a new PC that the graphics cards should probably ship separately packaged instead of already connected and would probably save them a lot of headache. they could just include a pamphlet on how to install a GPU to the motherboard, which isn\u2019t that hard. Also, another thing that was a bit of a disappointment is that I had also paid for professional wiring. However, the wiring was nice looking in front of the case, but was a nightmare behind the case where all the cables are hidden. And the RGB fans were connected to different controllers, which I had to go in and rewire in order for all RGB to work correctly. Luckily for me I have built several pieces in the past and have an idea of what I am doing. However, for someone who has never built a PC or has a clue I feel this would be troubling for them to have to deal with. I think that most people ordering a PC from a online PC builder want a finished product that they don\u2019t have to mess with out of the box. This is one of the reasons why instead of building my own PC this go around I ordered from cyber power PC was to eliminate having to deal with the hassle. That is not what happened. Next time I will just build my own PC."

The real issues came when I got the tower. All looked and was packaged well. Upon first start up I noticed the front fans were not powering on. I shut the PC down and removed the side panel to take a look. To my discovery, the wiring was a huge mess. There was basically a rats nest of wires and bundles just stuffed into the bottom portion. The connectors for the fan were out of place and had a piece of electrical tape over them(I assume to try and keep them in place). The way this was setup was pretty awful and there is a bundle of board wires that run right over top of the front fan connectors that when the side panel is placed on it applies pressure and easily knocks the connectors loose. These connectors had no grip in place whatsoever and when connected you could disconnect them by simply blowing air from your mouth. I do not know why they were so loose however, after making a few adjustments of my own all is well. I currently do not have the patience to address the rats nest of wiring stuffed in the bottom half right now but I\u2019ll get there eventually. Overall the PC performs as expected of the parts ordered and that\u2019s the only reason I give this a 3 out of 5. The quality of parts seems good but the wiring in general was very poorly done and looked rushed."

I don't think a client should pay more for piece of mind regarding a quality build and proper shipping.  Just because  these additional charges seem to be industry standard doesn't mean that CyberpowerPC has to do this also.  Charge everyone a few bucks more and just do it.

When I finally did receive my PC it was built to perfection (and I've ordered from them before with the same perfect results on build) and they're still the only builder I'll go with, just wish there was more direct honesty during the order process."

After launching windows 11 for the first time, then restarting the PC for the first time... the PC entered a restart loop that could only be fixed by using the windows boot manager in the bios. Then, after finally booting into windows for the 2nd time and then trying to completely shut down the computer, Windows 11 blue screen crashed when attempting to turn the computer back on. It had to be completely reinstalled. I also discovered that the CPU fan was plugged into the wrong port on the motherboard, and was disappointed to see an ugly zip-tie job on my cables after paying extra for \"professional\" cable management.These problems were not a big deal for me to fix myself, but I can see how a new PC owner would have been completely panicked or put off by these same issues occurring to them."

In what I was hoping was going to be a hassle free experience not having to build a PC myself, I ended up going through a bigger hassle to get this PC to work than if I were to have built it myself for less money.

Adding RAM was easy. Adding an M.2 SDD was OK except for the missing screws. Adding hard drives was painfully hard, screws and cables were missing, and the power cables were not accessible. I had to redo a good amount of the wiring in order to free up the SATA power cables (and I lost the RGB fans in the process, I must have disconnected something without realizing), it's been one of the harder experiences I've had installing a hard drive in a new PC. I know that, in theory, I can add another 2 hard drives in the case, but I won't even consider it given how hard the first 2 were.Ultimately, the machine works great, with the upgrades that I wanted, but it took a lot of swearing to get it to that state, and I can only rate the overall experience 4 stars because of those upgrade difficulties."

On Sunday, I went and checked the system over again to show someone the specifications and noticed there was a $50 discount I did not put a check mark in to apply the discount. I sent an email and the reply on Monday was that I would need to cancel my order and place a new order. At that time, every other discount still applied, so modifying the order to apply that discount seemed like an easy billing solution. They put the order on hold until I told them just to process the order. I did not have the time to cancel an order and place the identical order so I could get a billing discount. This is something the company should work on. Having to cancel an order (which was already billed to my credit card), and then place the same exact order to get a billing discount is not good customer service."

My only 'complaint' is that you have to get the PC with Windows (though every other dealer is the same so nothing really against CyberPower). For the majority of people that's what they are after, but I'm a Linux user, so having to pay for Windows when I didn't want it, was the only downside. Maybe add an option for no OS? All-in-all a great buying experience and I would highly recommend them."

On average I get about 7 years before I really need to replace a system and that isn\u2019t because it stops working. It is because the technology has developed beyond what the PC can handle. This last purchase was no exception. I ordered on 14 October and it was delivered on 20 October. That was with customizations. I will keep purchasing from CyberPower.

          "Contenu": "I bought a prebuilt computer and paid extra for the foam insert in the case to prevent damage during transport. However, the graphics card arrived damaged. There was no physical damage but it clearly did not work. That said it was very easy to request a replacement, and the shipping was paid for. It took about two weeks between when I shipped out the old graphics card and when I received my new one. And the new one works. I'm still giving five stars despite it not working out of the box because the return process was easy, and even though I had to wait a little longer than I was hoping for, everything turned out great in the end."

I had tried 2 different back-ups and a power strip just to be sure. He issued a return shipping label with in minutes. I sent it back and they turned it around in a day. I had been told it could take as long as the original build. I could not have asked for better tech and customer service. My new PC runs like a champ.I also have a PC built by Cyberpower in 2017. It's still going strong. I have an issue with the connection between my PC and any web browser because of the last security update of Windows 11. I can still play on-line games with no problem. It is a software issue and software is not my forte. I had absolutely no issues until the update and you can't delete a security update...believe me I tried. Yet, I can run GW2, Fortnight, Destiny2, and many other games with no problems. It's still a powerhouse, runs smoothly for programs and any game you want to play! I still love my PC after all these years."
