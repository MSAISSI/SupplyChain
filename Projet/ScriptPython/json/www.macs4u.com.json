I took my mac to a local shop for them to realize it was a bad connectivity issue with the battery. I got it fixed for 50$ where macs4u were going to charge me an arm and a leg...I wouldn't know, they never got back to me. Terrible customer service. Think twice before using them!"

We have paid dearly for this computer in lost time alone and it would be the decent thing to do to send out another WORKING computer for us to transfer this data too, BEFORE shipping the faulty computer back.

I would think spending a little extra on a everythig would upgrade me to a slightly newer model that doesnt take so long to load on opening the screen. Called after review and Basically wanted me to change my review to a positive one. I left another review in which they decided to try and get it deleted. So I will repost here on the original review.I bought this paid $1000 for the upgrades and package and it was slow from the beginning, had only less than an hour on full charge. I\u2019ve needed to plug it in from that point forward to work. I had an existing charger that was the correct one so I used it saving this one since they always bend and break easily. I pulled it out to use and it does not work because I was sent the wrong wattage charger. My MacBook Pro takes about 10 minutes to boot up and takes forever to sign in to get to work on adobe cloud graphics. I feel I wasted my money and they wanted me to just hange their rating to benefit themselves."

Same issue: would stop accepting a charge regardless of cord and adapter. The third one lasted just long enough to get past warranty then the same issue happened. I took it to a local Mac repair place who diagnosed it needed a new battery. If you want a Frankenstein (and not the funny Mel Brooks version) computer, with questionable parts from other dead computers, buy from here. Gave two stars as they tried. (Rev: Why not replace cord first time if that was issue? And 12 mo warranty expires from purchase of first computer; third replacement computer was well within 12 months of receipt but outside original computer purchase."

The signature-only mandate is great for security, but not for those working days away from home. \u2026 UPDATE: macs4U's reply to this review stated that I could have KEYED IN the FedEx location during ordering, but let's be very clear about this \u2014 there was no dropdown menu with a FedEx location as an option nor was there a prompt about keying in a FedEx location as an alt shipping address (i.e. I would have to have known IN ADVANCE the retail store would accept my package and allow me to pick it up). Consequently, my review has dropped to two stars b/c of your obtuse response. \u2026 2nd UPDATE: I didn't misunderstand your explanation. Apparently you misunderstood my parenthetical reference above. \u2026 Your instructions need revision. I know this because I have 20+ yrs in PR/Mkt and have written copy for the various pages of a payment gateway. I suggest you conduct a trial purchase and ask yourself: \"How would a consumer know that shipping to a FedEx store is acceptable if we don't tell them or they don't know this in advance?\" \"And why would a consumer choose a FedEx retail store without prior authorization?\""

I called customer service to see what the issue was & he said some of our info in the 3rd party purchasing software must have not lined up. The money would be back in our account in a few days and I should try to buy it through PayPal. WELL, an ENTIRE week goes by, no money. I check every day and call a few times, same answer. My bank account even says that it's no longer a pending charge, its complete. My husband makes 4 or 5 calls, NO ONE has answers. He keeps getting the same \"Just wait\" even after telling them, they HAVE to have our money because its out of our account. They even told us to have our bank fax some sheet to prove we didn't have it at one point. So we had all these phone calls. FINALLY, we had to ask to speak to a supervisor (Brandon), he tried to help us, gave us the info for the finance people. It was clear he felt bad and empathized with us, but that still didn't excuse the fact that the company had no idea what happened to our money. It took ANOTHER week, and finally they refunded my money. Thankfully we didn't have to dispute the charge through bank but I find it super irresponsible that they had NO clue where our money was at (or had ZERO answers) for TWO WEEKS. This was a business purchase too so I was losing time on my deadlines! They at least should have offered a discount on the computer I wanted to purchase or some sort of help for the grievance and loss of business they costed me.  All this to say, I'm glad they honored their word & refunded me but they were such a pain to deal with and very incompetent in knowing what was actually going on, that I will not use them or recommend them to anyone I know."

          "Contenu": "My experience with your company and staff was fine and effortless and I received my computer very fast and in good order.  After a few days of having my data transferred to the new computer, being walked through reinstalling my Adobe apps via phone, which took some time and frustration, I felt like things were getting back to normal as I got used to my new computer.  Then some glitches came with the keyboard.  The left shift key, when depressed, took me directly to the Desktop.  I called you at Macs4u, and was directed to call Apple Care, which came with my purchase, and of which I was very thankful to have.  I also discovered that the whole row of top keys did not function at all.  I spent many hours, stretched over three days, talking to at least four service agents at Apple.  They had me perform countless tasks over and over to no avail.  I have owned and used a computer for many, many years, but am not a \"techie\" so this was very stressful for me.  Just the thought of sending the new computer back for a replacement, because no one could figure out the problem, sent me into a tailspin just thinking about all the time, energy, and money I had put into transferring over all my data from the previous computer to the new.  Finally, one of the Apple senior supervisors came across the problem.  There was something in the keyboard settings that was not set properly.  I don't know why others were not able to discover this, but thankful he was able to.  So, because someone in your employ did not program the settings correctly, I was put through a lot of frustration and dismay.  I know things like this can happen.  Purchasing a renovated computer, to me, already had a risk factor to it, and I guess one of my fears came true that something might go wrong, and it did.  I'm very thankful the problem was corrected without having to get a replacement and begin the whole process of transferring data over again.  For this reason, I have to give a rating of two stars: \"a lot of friction.\""

          "Contenu": "First the good, the technical support from IT was responsive. They went through troubleshooting with me and spent hours trying to help me with all the difficulties getting the iMac up and running (multiple times, many hours, over several days). However, in the end, the actual refurbished computer (iMac with fusion drive) was a lemon.After I lost a full week of productivity trying to make the computer work, Macs4u authorized a return. But, they then charged me an exorbitant restocking fee for a defective computer.The iMac was unable to wake up after sleeping. After going into sleep mode, instead of waking, I would find the computer completely unresponsive. The only option was a forced restart in recovery mode, which would reveal that the computer had rejected the operating system or the hard drive (flashing \u201cno\u201d symbol or flashing folder with a \u201c?\u201d ). These errors require wiping the computer & rebuilding the whole computer. I even resorted to physically driving the machine to their local HQ for an expert rebuild & reinstall, but with the same result: a full system failure after sleep.The returns department tried to blame the instability issue on my migrated data & an older program, however this is completely unjustified. My programs and data worked just fine on my MacPro and since returning the defective iMac from macs4u, I have purchased a Mac Mini that is running my migrated profile just fine with zero issues. The problem was not which version of macOS, or my migrated data, or certain software, it was a lemon of a computer.These types of hardware problems can and do occur,\u2014 as my grandma used to say it\u2019s not whether problems happen, it\u2019s how you handle them, that matters.What can\u2019t be justified and is the source of my grievance was their refusal to stand behind their warranty. The website states (1) that hardware is covered under warranty and (2) that warranty returns are not charged a restocking fee. I have since learned that the fusion drives are particularly unstable and prone to failure. If Macs4u had followed their own policies and refunded the full purchase price, I would be giving a different review here, despite losing so much work time trying to make the defective iMac work. After making up for the lost productivity, I probably would even have purchased a replacement from them, but a computer without the fusion drive. Instead, after working double time to make up for my lost week, I went to a different retailer and purchased a computer with a solid state hard drive and I have had zero problems. An expensive lesson indeed.From the website:\u201cOur warranty is a hardware warranty and covers every component of the computer including the AC charger to work as designed and are covered against mechanical and electrical failures. Simple as that!\u201d (1)\u201cIf the refund is based on a warranty issue, the restocking fee is waived. \u201c (2)"

I bought this refurbished for one of my kid going into his freshman year at college, another of my kids going into senior year at college purchased BRAND NEW mac book pro for same money I spent and everything was loaded, updated and ready to use immediately. I was not told that we would have to do anything to this so I was expecting to be able to turn on and use ...that was disappointing.

The price was OK, but the machine was a bit older than I wanted (2012) and I can tell there's been some wear-and-tear on it (such as worn spots on keys, hidden by the silicone keyboard cover) even though I paid for a machine in \"Excellent-Grade A Condition.\" So far I haven't had any issues, other than I lost some of my alias folder connections when I reloaded my data from my back-up hard drive. Also, the two-day FedEx took nearly a week to get to me in Southeast Alaska. I did buy the two-year warranty, but hope I never need to use it."

I was not charged extra, as I should not have been, because it was obvious the \"expert\" did not know what he was doing, since he had to put me on hold over and over, to check with his supervisor.The Mac is adequate but is by no means as good as the one it replaced. It takes forever to load pages. This is quite frustrating, since I do many searches. Also, the power cord continually falls out of its plug, even when the Mac is moved ever so slightly. This should have been noticed and remedied before it was sent out. It is also frustrating that support service is available only during standard daytime business hours and not on weekends at all. They also prefer that you make appointments for service. There is no real consideration for customer convenience. Since I am up at night, this is especially frustrating.  Apple Care was far superior.I would only recommend company this to someone who absolutely could not afford a new Apple product."

They act like no one works! Started out great and fell down to a zero when having questions as to the delivery being signed for. Replying to my email a day later. Not good on that. So you say that it is a late 2016 model. And on the MacBook itself it is a early 2015. So I change my review to full of crap. Do not buy from them. And as far as the shipping. Called fedex and they also said the same as their site, the shipper, macs4u wouldn\u2019t let me see the delivery time. So??? Good luck to whomever buys from them. You can see they lie to try and make them look better.>>>> Looked up my MacBook Air and yes, my MacBook I bought from macs4u says on the display EARLY 2015 and yes, that is what apple says it should be. So are you saying you shipped me the wrong MacBook? Thanks for your quick responses, to bad you weren't this quick when I actually had questions on my order."

          "Contenu": "My purchase, delivery, and initial setup experience with mac4u.com was great. Positives:First, their purchase options included payment via AFFIRM which enabled me to get the exact iMac that I wanted and not have to settle. Next they reached out to me after the computer was shipped via email, text, and phone. The phone call was a very professional touch which I really appreciated. My shipment arrived in just under four business days from MN to NC which was sooner than I expected for such a large package.The equipment was nicely packed and the smaller peripherals like magic keyboard and magic mouse where secured to the inside of the shipping container and undamaged.After plugging in the new computer powered up with no issues and immediately recognized the peripherals. I was expecting a system setup screen but instead got a standard Mac OS desktop with an open document from macs4u again thanking me for my purchase and letting me know the default system login/password.AT THIS POINT I AM A 5* CUSTOMER BUT THEN...Negatives: Reasons why I cannot give Five Stars - all of which are easily remedable.First, as an IT professional, turning on a \"new-to-me\" computer and not having to go through an on-screen system setup process is a HUGE security concern and means that someone else set up the administrator account and may or may not have access to your system once it is connected to the internet.THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE!! People who are not as computer savvy as I am may just leave the setup as-is and with the default login and passwords that macs4u provide. Someone with bad intent could easily find out via the computer owner that they got a great computer and great deal from mac4u and end up getting into the admin account by guessing.Second, I connected my Apple Thunderbolt Monitor to my new iMac and did a few minutes of web surfing. I left the computer for a few minutes upon which it went to sleep. When I giggled the mouse to wake the system back up, the iMac came up but the display did not. Within 30 seconds the system threw a serious error and shutdown.It would not reboot.So now I am less than a hour into owning a very expensive computer that will not boot fully.I ended up having to access the restore menu manually, erasing the hard drive, and reinstalling Mac OS on my system which took another three hours.Now everything is working fine.The issue seems to have been that the OS that macs4u installed on the iMac was actually from a MacBook Pro(MBP). The iMac and the MBP OS's are not exactly the same so restoring the system from Apple servers resolved the issue.Seeing as macs4u has paid support options based on time spent as well as warranty options, this could have been a big headache for others at best or a return for macs4u at worst."

I ordered the Black Friday Special Macbook Pro (late 2017) and after a perfect two weeks or so of functioning, it started getting freezy. Two freaking weeks.However, I got on the Help Chat on the Macs4U website and they were awfully nice about the return. They were prompt, clear, and even sent me a shipping label to cover costs. Once I sent it back, they got it processed within five hours and offered a FULL REFUND, no restocking fee. It's rare that a company go so above and beyond in their service. And in the end, maybe I just got unlucky with the unit that I got; statistically, it's bound to happen. It's how a company handles it that matters."

I spent a few hours talking to the cc co. going back and forth on what the problem was, resending the purchase on Macs4u while still on the phone with the card co. and so on. Finally I called Macs4u and a very nice gentleman named Wolfgang worked everything out for me quickly and efficiently. I was feeling very frustrated and wanted to take it out on him, but he was so charming and helpful that my anger dissolved. A few days later my computer arrived and so far I am very pleased. So my review at this point is, great customer service and a computer that has lived up to my expectations so far."

My only complaint would be that I was a bit stressed out that it felt like it took forever to get the computer which I paid over a grand for mailed to me with the free shipping from fedex which macs4you uses. Took 6 days which felt like 8 to get from Minnesota to Oregon. Amazon would have under its free shipping had it shipped to me in 2-5 days which I would have been less anxious and worried about it being banged up on its journey to me. When the computer did arrive from Macs4you I was impressed with how they had it boxed and padded with lots of foam! Anyhow I am happy I went with the older MacBook with the USB ports and SSD slot built in.  I am pleased with the perk of getting the hard cover in blue for the MacBook along with the keyboard protector."

Additionally, the charge cord didn't work.  We sent it back and they updated some hardware for $100.  I'm pretty sure that the \"new\" cord they sent back was the old cord, or one just as bad.  It never worked correctly.  Strike Two.  Then, the second computer we bought as a high school graduation gift for our daughter.  It worked fine...for 5 months.  We had to put a new $200 hard drive in it.  Strike Three.  UPDATE: Within minutes of posting my original review (1 star), a very sincere, polite, and attentive man called and resolved our issue to my satisfaction. I was impressed by this customer service. So, since we have had issues with equipment, I must take a star away. But at least they made things right. On the customer service end, I would give a 5 star."

Somehow I stumbled upon Macs4u and found that they had what I needed and would even install the OS that I required. I'm still using that computer for work today, so when it came time to order a MacBook Air, I immediately turned to them and found out that they had the best prices and service for refurbished Macs anywhere. Both computers look like brand new and function flawlessly and their customer service is always top notch. I've recommenced them to a few friends now. Nice to know there's great small businesses out there making a difference!"

Not only that, but the customer service they provided has also been fantastic! They helped me transfer my old data over to my new desktop and even made sure I had the most current updates to the applications I use most frequently. I couldn't be happier with my purchase from Macs4U and would be happy to do business with them again. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to anyone looking for a great deal on Apple products. THANK YOU!"

I called to doublecheck and they sorted it out the next day. The laptop shipped on time and arrived the next day (today) with zero issues. They even called me a few times to give me updates on the shipping progress. GREAT attention to customer service. Even though it's only been a day, the laptop is working great and literally looks out of the box brand new. Not a single scratch or visible wear anywhere on the top case, bottom screen, keys or track pad. The battery only has 100 cycles which is very little use. It also comes with a 1 year warranty from MAC4U and has remaining Applecare warranty as well. SUPER impressed with how this went down."

In the years since, I purchased a new iPad & iPhone from 2 separate local sources because I believe in shopping locally. Sadly, my experience with calls or visits for help locally were less than satisfactory.I'm not a tech expert but do small-time contract work & now need a quicker, newer set-up for book formatting & graphics programs. I researched, narrowed down my search, then called Macs4u. The folks who helped me were pleasant, knowledgable, patient, & guided me toward my best bet.When I typed the wrong payment information, unfortunately, my credit card was refused & all my credit cards were automatically locked. Yet my Macs4u helpers neither judged nor revealed frustration. They offered alternatives & paused my purchase until I could take care of issues the next morning.I recommend Macs4u without reservation! They hire capable, helpful, people-oriented employees, their products arrive quickly, safely, & as advertised, & someone is available to offer help when I stall. As long as they continue to strive for excellence, I'll continue to heartily recommend Macs4u."

The MacBook Pro I got a couple of years ago was to replace a much older one and it is still working perfectly. This 2017 iMac that I just bought was bought to replace a much older one and I wanted to double up the ssd to 2 tb. Again with this purchase, I had a couple of choices and the guy I spoke to talked to me about the differences to make my decision easier. I got a wireless keyboard and the iMac. Everything arrived in about a week and the computer was in perfect shape. The keyboard had a sticking key and when I call, they immediately got another one out to me. I am completely satisfied with the computers, the service and would recommend this company to anyone looking to upgrade from an older system and not willing or able to pay the price of a new computer."
