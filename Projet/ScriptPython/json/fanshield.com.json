Why should my bank eat the cost, albeit it a minimal amount, and I have to endure the hassle of a new card because of Protecht/FanShield\u2019s thievery?My advice to consumers is do not use HotelPlanner.com as a liaison for booking a hotel because it allowed me to incur the fraudulent charge from Protecht/FanShield.I have emailed back and forth about this issue for one week.  No refund has been issued.  Time for talk is over. I am going all out to alert others and try to prevent FanShield and its cohorts from stealing from innocent consumers. I also want the bogus charge  along with an aggravation amount paid to myself."

We went ahead and opened a claim and got in response \u201c The coverage under this peril (Unforeseen Severe Weather) would apply as such: \u201cSevere weather conditions which result in your inability to attend the event. You must be unable to reach the event by car or travel carrier. This does not include weather such as heavy snowfall with roads open, ice on roads, or abnormally heavy rain, unless the intervention of authorities is involved.\u201dSo basically what this means is that unless ROADS ARE CLOSED we have to show up and \u201cenjoy\u201d ourselves and no matter that we got this insurance we are at full loss. In fact we could have easily changed the dates but because we got this insurance we are totally and royally screwed."

I showed all that in my claim and all natl weather reports. They would not refund and the lady argued with me she wouldn't and expected us to fly on with the possibility of being stuck sleeping in an airport for days as flights cancelled. Then they argued that the streets would have to be closed so prove that to them. I didn't see their 72 hour cancelation or the email until she told me it was sent after. That has nothing to do with the severe weather that came the days prior to the trip right before.

When you first read about it they make it sound like it would be easy to get a refund if need be, only to find out unless you have a major, mostly unheard of reason, you will not receive a refund.  Travel plans can change all the time and with family coming from out of state I thought I would be covered if they couldn't make it.  They responded very quickly to tell me my reason did not qualify for a refund.  I will never purchase this kind of \"protection\" again.  Lesson learned."

My total spend on tickets was $360 not including Fanshield. I got the plan thinking worst-case scenario we don\u2019t get to the location, we can be reimbursed. However, it would actually require a life-threatening emergency for reimbursement. Normal events, like a toddler recovering from a cold needing to stay in bed, or a parent with a disability not being able to make her way to the event site, are not covered, and those are the very common occurrences that can mess up a schedule and cause money to be wasted. I wouldn\u2019t recommend buying this product for tickets that cost less than $50."

Only \"We are review your documents and will get back to you shortly\".Update:Fanshield wants a signed note from your doctor, despite giving them my discharge official documents from office staff. This was not good enough. The process made me feel like I was in grade school. They also again wanted proof of purchase which I had already sent to them. Finally they wanted to know why my wife couldn't go to the same event that I obviously could not go to. At the end of jumping thru all of these hoops I did receive my refund thru PayPal.

We canceled our flights, and every other event we had scheduled to come see him the day he had the surgery. Got a refund easily from everyone else, except fan shield. We provided documents showing he was on the list, that he got his new liver on the date we said and etc... still got drug along and asked for more documents... Was only until we got ahold of Aaron that anything was done. I honestly would give this a one star if it wasn't for Aaron, he went to bat for us. Understanding how big of a headache this has been for us and for our family. We really truly appreciate him. In the future, maybe have a little more understanding when a family is going through something like a transplant. It's not a planned event, we were told he was going to be waiting a couple of months for the liver but found a perfect match much sooner. So, it was a shock to us all. We finally received our refund 3 weeks later, thanks to Aaron."

I received my refund, chose venmo and the money was on there the same day I submitted the additional information needed. They did require my doctor to specifically state I am unable to attend \"event name\" due to acute illness. When you purchase the protection I think a disclaimer about documentation needed should be displayed so there are no surprises. I would purchase the protection plan again in the future and it makes sense why they need this proof or they'd be out a lot of money. I also noticed they don't cover COVID related events which is strange. You'd think they would as long as proof of a positive test from your doctor is given or some kind of note from your doctor about being exposed. I think its a bad look for the company to rule out any covid related issued all together. Fortunately, my illness wasn't COVID related, but feel for the ones who end up sick, unable to attend their event, then to be told they are out the money."

On several attempts, I was continually told the wait time was over two hours.  Perhaps due to COVID, but who knows.  I was able to COMPLETELY resolve my issues by leaving a review on this site.  FanShield immediately reached out to me and solved my problem.  I appreciate their time and helpfulness in sending my reimbursement."

I will use Fanfare again in the future but i will make sure that I understand the basics of the fine print first. Beware...they have their fine print worded in such a way that they can basically get out of almost any claim. They state directly in their advertising that they cover illness, however, in their terms and conditions they state that they don't cover pandemics. I took this to mean that they would not cover claims if there was a large outbreak and the event was cancelled... that is not the case. They do not cover Covid claims at all! IMO this should be CLEARLY stated on the front of their advertising."

We were unable to go anywhere after eating the chicken until we checked out on the 19th.  Initially, we were denied our refund for the dinner cruise ($286.74).  Finally after numerous frustrating e-mails, Natasha reached out and resolved the issue in an extremely short amount of time.  I really don't think we would have received our refund had it not been for her and her dedicated customer-oriented approach.  Natasha certainly showed her integrity and went over and beyond to get us a positive resolution.  She is a role model for her co-workers.  You are fortunate to have her in your company.

I received a prompt email detailing the method I needed to use to obtain the required insurance. However, due to personal circumstances I didn't use the link until some time later but was then informed that the link had expired. I emailed again and received a very gracious reply providing me with another link. I have now used this link and have purchased the insurance to cover all my costs associated with the event. Everything was dealt with expertly and with great support and service so keep up the good work."

So, ultimately though the claim was initially denied, Corey ensured I was compensated. I greatly appreciated the kindness and thorough follow-up.Original review: I bought this insurance for an event because it was advertised as  \"covering illness\".   I noticed others on this site buying this insurance due to uncertainty of COVID related events (as did I), but you should be aware, once you get the insurance you learn that they don't cover COVID, and will deny your claim if that is the illness that prevented your ability to attend the event.  My claim was denied due to \"no coverage for a pandemic\" even though they advertise that it is insurance that will cover illness, and even though I provided the requested documentation."
