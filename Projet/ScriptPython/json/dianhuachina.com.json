I called a few numbers in China, including fixed line and mobile. It always rang once then disconnected. I also tried different access number including Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane, all having same issue.I had this issue a few weeks ago and reported to customer support. I was told it's one-off but it seems recurring.I have been with DianhuaChina.com for many years. If this problem persists and I am not able to make overseas calls when needed, I have to ask for refund of remaining credit and find another service provider."

Unfortunately, since the old plan has been canceled, we will not be able to activate it again. We suggest you continue with the Monthly Plan purchased today which has a renewal date of 07/19/2021.We appreciate your patience.\u201d"
