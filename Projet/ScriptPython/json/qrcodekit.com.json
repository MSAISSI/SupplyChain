          "Contenu": "Is a misleading advertisement: it says that you can make a free trial by having ONE free QR code (and it is not specified that it has limited value in time) implying that the first QR code is free and, if you like the system, you can sign up, pay and make other QR codes. So it becomes a blackmail, because we created a QR code printed on dozens of copies of a product, considering to create latelay more codes for a fee, but after 2 weeks we got the blackmail of having to pay a QR code that should have been free, and they canceled it, so now that QR code doesn\u2019t lead to the desired page, creating a big problem to the company, as if he had put in the cellar and tied up his own friend. It's ridiculous to consider the \"test\" for a site that creates QR code as \"a trial period of ONE code\" (besides on the site is not clarified in this sense), if it had been immediately and directly communicated a \"paid version\" we would have used it, but at that moment, looking for a site togenerate a QR code before sending the file to the print shop we used this site, considering to sign up later, waiting to get if it was a half-scam or not, and in fact we did well not to subscribe and not use a paid version because it is tremendously not serious to attract users with this \"trick\". So, we decided to replace it with stickers doing it with another site that REALLY offers a free QR code (forever working) and then we will pay other products by subscribing. In so much competition it is really foolish to create such a phishing and blackmail people afterwards."

I did not want it for business I wanted it for voluntary work.  The product is fine but I had not understood at the outset that with this company the codes used in the trial period would be deactivated and no longer work if I did not subscribe at the end of the trial period.  I do think that it should be absolutely clear that the codes created in the trial period will expire once the 2 weeks have expired and a warning ought to be given clearly that it is not advisable to use the trial codes in any permanent paperwork - in my case I also put the website on which was just as well.  Obviously at the outset you just don't know if you want to pay for a subscription and after a week I found it too fiddly.  No doubt the warning was there somewhere in the microscopic small print Ts and Cs; that any codes created would not last beyond the 2 weeks but it was not apparent to me when I went through the process.  So I feel like I wasted my time with it."

Pick a QR solution, not just a generator.QR Codes have been around for two decades, but they never became mainstream. 2020\u201321 changed that. As the pandemic hit in 2020, QR Codes took the center stage. Brand owners and marketers felt inclined to use QR Codes as a contactless solution driver.
