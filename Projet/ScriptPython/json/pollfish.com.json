Very bad initial customer service. I do not plan on using or recommending pollfish in the future. My survey was geared towards the Latino population, it being a huge market in the US I would expect better and faster results. Over three months of waiting is not ideal in a fast moving world."

          "Contenu": "I wont be using the service again. I made a formal complaint to Pollfish and no response to it so far from Customer Services, nor from any one at the company.  I got conflicting answers from CS Pollfish, Mike Kissen and Stephanie Johnson from Prodege. I requested a refund from Customer Services, they replied two weeks ago saying that they would process it.However, the week after I started to get constant and repetitive emails from Mrs Johnson telling me that they could upgrade my account to an elite plan for an additional 6K. I declined her offer various times, and told her about the refund being already processed. She told me that that was not possible because refunds can only be made in an 8-month window period. No evidence on this, the contract does not say so!! She said that the legal department had told her so, but she couldn't refer me to anyone from the legal department. Nor could she give documentation on this. In fact, I found no documentation on this on the Pollfish webpage. All lies!Since she was constantly bombarding me with emails, I asked her to stop and refer me to another representative.  Afterwards, she referred me to Mike Kissen, who unlike Mrs. Johnson said to me that my credits had expired. Hence Pollfish was doing me a favour, as apparently credits expire after some time. Again, conflicting information and lies.I asked Mr. Kissen for open documentation on all these clauses. He referred me to the terms of services (Researcher). But again I couldn't find any of the points that both Mr. Kissen and Mrs Johnson were talking about. Although I asked them to refer me to the specific clauses for keeping my money on hold, they didn't reply to my emails, which is quite surprising considering that I had been bombarded by emails from Mrs. Johnson to upgrade to an elite plan the day before. Nor did I get any response from any of the Pollfish representatives (Cs), nor from Customer Services.This is quite uncomfortable and unconventional in a respected polling company like I would like think that Pollfish is. I was very happy working with Pollfish in the past. However this was unacceptable.  I brought this issue to the Pollfish management and made a formal complaint, and no reply so far. My takeaway - the customer service from Pollfish and Prodege are willing to lie and give conflicting information just for the sake of keeping clients. No ethics nor principles are followed. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY if you care about TRANSPARENCY and ETHICS."

They said we had too many disqualifying questions in Survey Monkey, while we had no such questions. They couldn't troubleshoot it, and then held on to our money for a week without a proper refund. You get what you pay for with these guys."

You can also ask \"screening questions\" to disqualify people who aren't in your psychographic, or aren't potential prospects for what you offer. And you can ask up to 15 questions at no extra cost.My one complaint is that some of my surveys have \"failed\" because of a low incidence rate. This can happen when you have 2 or 3 screening questions. The thing is, we pay an extra fee for each screening question. Since we are paying more, it seems to me that we are compensating Pollfish for that lower incidence rate. When a survey fails, we remove one of the screening questions, making the revised survey cost less. But any difference we are owed back (because we paid more for more screening questions) stays in our account as a credit for the future. It is not issued as a refund."

It can finish the survey task in a very short time, and be convenient to collect the demographic information of the samples."

I showed multiple visual website drafts and different examples of content and the Pollfish community gave me stats to help me choose which website appearance to choose and also what content to put on it.Disliked:Can't load multiple videos for a question. I had to compile all the different videos in one video file, and I noticed a trend towards the audience choosing the first video as a favourite, even if I reverse the order. I feel like a lot of them see the first exhibit at the start of the video, then answer that it's their favourite, so they can make money faster, rather than viewing them all and giving a real opinion.I believe a lot of people are using their phone to use the app. And this is a problem when you need to upload a high-resolution image that needs to be in a desktop aspect ratio. Pollfish should also find a way to filter out all the people when answering as quickly as they can, to make money as quickly as they can. One way is to, encourage people creating the survey, to create answers that aren't relevant to the questions or thing to assess, to filter out the people that want to rush through it."

As well, I am impressed about Pollfish data quality system, it is something necessary to obtain representative information. However, every company always has something to improve. In my particular case, my survey took longer to achieve the quantity of responses that you had expected. Evenmore, I believe that is one of the most important part of a survey process to try it on a reduce part of your sample for knowing if you are doing the correct questions to achieve your goal, maybe this is a service you could also add for pollsters would get more accurate on what they are looking for and would be more satisfied with Pollfish. It would be really useful.I hope my review could help you.Best regards."

On the Individuals tab, for example, there are series of question/ answer choices in a merged cell in row 1 compared to s separate column for each like you would expect3. Export: even more basic, some cells in the CSV export are not usable. The cells would not add, etc. - something very odd about the formatting. 4. Image uploads. The tool would constantly get buggy with image uploads and either crash altogether, images would not update, etc.Combining all these issues, when trying to run a series of many surveys quickly and repetitively, Pollfish was just too much of a time suck and (sad, but true, literally just wasted lots of our time). We took our repeatable surveys for this ongoing project back to our main stream survey tool and a full service sample provider, for only a modest cost increase. We were sad it didn't work out, we really liked the idea of Pollfish, and we love the logo :-)"

Ended up looking for a different way to collect answers. They have great customer service. A bottom line, and In my humble opinion based on my experience, if you have a general survey with questions about everyday matters with direct answers, then yes, if you are looking in a specific subject that requires participants to type responses and discuss, I prefer that you find a different platform. P.S; they will ask you to add more filters to your survey to target the audience; that will cost you more still, you will NOT get what you are looking for."

Although Pollfish does not offer as many features as does Qualtrics, the navigation is intuitive and survey deployment was super smooth and fast.  We got the survey data collection with 150 participants completed within an hour!!!  Looking at the results, though, I do feel that there is room for improvement in Pollfish's response integrity monitoring algorithms.  We would had to exclude about 8% of the cases because the participants were clearly responding in a random manner (we check for internal consistency to identify these cases)--which is fine because this was just a pilot study...but that wouldn't have worked for us, had this been the actual study.  This has not happened to us with Qualtrics or Gallup, so we are a little disappointed."

I do appreciate that Pollfish gives you the lots of demographic data and their pricing is relatively easy to follow. Pollfish makes it easy to segment, visualize, and download data.

You also have to be somewhat astute with DIY research software, especially with applied logic and setup, but if you are, it's a great tool to use.  It's been a wonderful experience for our company (small/mid-size) and has allowed us to enhance our findings and support strategies with actionable data.  Definitely would recommend!"

This was exceptional service. Outside of this, the platform really does provide a variety of ways to to customize and configure your survey in all different kinds of ways, a very rich toolset for conducting surveys.The only downside I remember was how long it too to complete the survey.

Exclusively surveying active customers with Mailchimp (or another low-cost tool) can result in biased answers. The Pollfish audience ensures we get quality results from our market research efforts.2) The survey editing and response view UI/UX is exceptionally intuitive. It offers functionality that other tools hide behind steep paywalls.3) Pollfish reviews all of our surveys before distributing them to respondents. Having a second set of eyes on the questions and survey structure is comforting. They've caught mistakes and made good recommendations. 4) The prices for recruiting/distributing the survey are fair and typically within the budget of our clients.5) It's easy for everyone on my team to collaborate on a survey."
