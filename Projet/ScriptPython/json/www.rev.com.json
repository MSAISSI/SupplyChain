          "Contenu": "I used the button through Vimeo to place an order for Spanish captions or subtitles since it was advertised I could do this directly through the site but be taken to a third party to order (Rev.com). I placed the order for three videos through Rev.com, which totaled almost $200. I then realized in the ordering process, I had not been asked what language I wanted the captions in. I reached out to support at Rev.com to see if that was something I missed. I was told that only English captions were available at this time. When I asked to have my order canceled, I was told I missed the refund window. When I asked to have my order switched to Spanish subtitles, I was told management would have to make that decision. I pointed out the policy Rev has on their site about English captions being free with all global subtitle orders but I was still told it was up to management. I reached out to Vimeo as well to let them know the button on their site was misleading. I sent in the screenshots showing where it advertised the ability to order subtitles but then that option never appears once you order through Vimeo. They said to ask for a refund and work it out with Rev. I waited a week and then asked Rev again if I could order the Spanish subtitles and pay the difference (I would pay almost $400 more to them for the subtitles) since the English captions come for free. At this time, I have still not received a response or a refund and it has been two weeks since my order. I am reviewing their services in this way because I have yet to receive what I wanted to order and they do not seem interested in helping me correct my mistake, even though it would result in me paying them (Rev) more money. I do not recommend Rev to anyone. And I am disappointed that Vimeo has decided to partner with them."

What kind of company based in America just takes money out of their client's checking accounts without  their client's authorization? Rev.com did this to me yesterday. Plus, I am unable to speak to any real people or contact them to discuss a solution. In addition, I just happened to notice, Rev.com just changed the terms of our agreement from Net 30 to Due upon Receipt... again, without any approval, authorization or agreement with me. I don't know what happened to Rev.com that made them go from a company with awesome, caring customer service staff to stealing money from their customers. But this is quite unbelievable. I choose how and when I pay my bills... not rev.com robots. I cannot recommend doing any business with Rev.comAnd where are they located? Austin, TX or San Francisco, CA,"

I spent several hours over two days on a job that involved a college lecture in a foreign country, with a prof with an accent who frequently was out of range of the recording equipment. Because I could not HEAR a lot of what the prof was saying, the job was declined, i was NOT paid the nearly $50 I earned, and my account was deactivated.  Also Rev needs to revisit their policy on not informing clients when Rev is informed that the job has been submitted inaccurately. Another job for which I was NOT paid involved a 5 minute presentation followed by 50 MINUTES of indistinct, unrelated chatter that the AI could not transcribe (and I'm sure the client did NOT want to pay for). The IC was expected to struggle to transcribe AND CAPTION nonsense, which would be impossible to do well, thus leading, again, to NO PAY and deactivation of account."

          "Contenu": "They have pretty good quality with short audio transcriptions.  However, if you get anything over an hour, they break the project up into small pieces and you end up with several transcribers working on the project, which really reduces the quality.  For me, having consistent speaker names, whether it be their actual names or Speaker 1/Speaker 2, etc, is important as the data analsysis is based on who the speaker is.  For my project they used four different transcribers for a 90ish minute audio transcription of a 10 person focus group.  Two of the four transcribers were able to identify names or apply consistent \"Speaker1, Speaker 2\" names.  For transcribers 3 and 4 it was all over the place.  At one point they had 16 speakers.  This would not have happened if they had used one transcriber, or even two for that matter.  Additionally, when I brought this up to REV, they kept saying that they did not guarantee the speaker names and that I needed to go and edit it myself.  I had two other focus group sessions that were less than an hour and had no issues with quality because they used one transcriptionist.  So BEWARE of long audio transcripts - they choose cost savings over quality and will do a terrible job."

Despite advertising greater features and more detailed services than other sites, the software seems unstable and proved unreliable for me.  On July 11, 2022, I used the site\u2019s recorder after a couple of test runs.  When I attempted to save my recording, it disappeared and the page reset itself --- prompting me to start a recording and forever losing the one I really needed.  My follow-up to Customer Support provided that Rev.com does not backup recordings and there are no options for recovery of recordings that do not save properly, or at all.  I thought I found a really good site that would not only deliver a quality recording together with transcription capability, but I did not even receive the benefit and advantage of a basic online recorder."

After some time, I WAS CHARGED the full subscription price of $29.99. NO email reminders were sent (both inbox and spam checked), NO notifications were used on the personal account screen, NO remaining days were counted anywhere - as most respectful services do.I requested a refund \\ explanation by contacting their support on Feb 8th (ticket 3067419) AND NEVER GOT A REPLY.Today, on Feb 17th, I reached support chat and their representative Quinton admitted that A) he personally saw my ticket AND DID NOT reply, B) the support team IS NOT aware of the notification system, C) NO refunds are actually possible, D) and also that I can send a complaint email...to their support (what an irony!)In other words, THE ONLY way for users to know about the remaining days is by checking a subscription tab constantly (but only if you are aware of it and if you managed to find one).My complaint is not about money themselves but about the level of communication, support and user treatment, meaning:1. There are NO any emails \\ reminders at least 24h before the trial period ends2. There are NO any website screen notifications3. Support DID NOT respond to the support ticket even though they KNEW there was a request4. Support DOES NOT aware about how their reminder system works5. REV.com according to support team (I have chat screenshots) is UNABLE to provide a refund for unsatisfied customers, who even DID NOT use the service, which can be easily checked.I am TOTALLY disappointed with my customer experience with this service ON EVERY level. Refund is a minimum that the respectful platforms must do in this kind of issue - especially if the service itself was not used AT ALL.I would like new users to keep these things in mind during your trial period."

Instead I got a document that looked like my 11 year old did it and it was just translated.  All the spaces and headers jumbled up. I don't know if I would use this group again.  Way too expensive for what you get."

Another song, they didn't start with the words, but they ended at the appropriate time, but still only up about 20-25% of the time needed. Another song they didn't start at the right time or end at the right time. For example - a line with 12 words, the caption popped up about 5 words in and went off with about 3 words left to be sung. I had to spend about 30 minutes editing the captions. I am lucky that I use Premiere Pro so it is not a super hard edit, just time consuming."

I wish I had a 5* to share because I liked this company a lot before this experience.*update- a full business day lost without being able to send my transcript to my research participant for approval and no indicator of when it will be rectified: I really expected better in putting right the order that's now very late in its proper turn around."

However, large chunks were labelled \"inaudible\" and many of the words were not corresponding to the actual audio. \r When I enquired, customer service did their best to have the scripts changed. However, more and more mistakes became apparent. In addition to this, I asked for specific labels on all scripts, which hadn't been done on several. Customer service changed this, but still, it was hard work getting formats the same. The margins are different on each script and like I said, half seemed like guess work. \r The accents were not difficult (English), one Scottish (not strong). I seriously cannot see why it was so hard for the transcribers. I also think each script was done by a different person. \r The most positive part was Amity. This person did their best to help me and went the extra mile to fix things. It is a shame this person wasn't the person transcribing! it would of been much better. \r Thanks to Amity, but I won't be using the service again."

Your files will all be sent to different transcribers - some are fantastic, others are unacceptable in quality. I had one interview returned with 20% transcribed as [inaudible]. On listening, the volume was fine, the accent was minimal and the words were very clear. The company re-did the transcription and it was somewhat improved, other files I simply re-did myself when I checked them. Transcription is not verbatim, and sometimes the transcriber changes the meaning of the text so careful checking is required (such that I I could have transcribed it myself). In one interview, the transcriber wrote the wrong word every single time it was (clearly) spoken, despite that word being obviously in the job title.  The company did try to correct interviews when I complained, but the quality is so variable and requires so much checking, I decided not to continue with my large project through this transcribing service - too much wasted time checking the accuracy of the work."

After searching many online sites, I found Rev.com and because of their advertised 100% guaranteed acceptance, I used their service. The turnaround time was quick and I thought all went well. Until I tried to use the certified, translated copy at the BMV in Indiana to get my license. The BMV requires that the certification letter state that the translation was not done by a friend or relative. (This is not the fault of rev.com, obviously.) So, I called their 800 number and spoke to a very nice woman to ask if they could add that verbiage to their letter for me. I was informed that they could not and that their translations are not typically accepted by DMV offices. She said if I had indicated on my request that that is what I was using it for they would have advised me against using their service. I asked for a refund since I could not use the translation they gave me and I felt that their website was misleading or at the very least unclear about who would accept their translations. Especially if this is something they are aware of. I was denied a refund. I am very unhappy with the fact that they, the translation experts, did not make it clear on their website that their services are not accepted by a very specific government office."

They charge $1.25 and pay their freelancers 30-60 cents per minute for inconsistent results. Google it.The people sign an NDA but that doesn't mean that your stuff is private. It just means they'll fire someone for sharing it. Your info could be going to ANYONE. You don't get to pick and choose because to do that you'd have to hire an individual. And the fact that they pay so little and mistreat their freelancers doesn't reassure me that people are motivated to care that much.Some of your instructions can be followed but it's not the same as being able to tell someone what you need and them understanding. They ARE REQUIRED to transcribe every fart, whisper, and private moment whether you want them to or not. You cannot tell them to leave it out.If you need things transcribed frequently, might as well hire someone for the same amount who can follow individual instructions and know exactly what you want, and be paid properly. They'll probably do a better job as well since they're not having to do twice the work for the same amount of money.The only plus is it takes slightly more effort to go find a transcriber on Fiverr or somewhere people advertise than it does to drop your file into the slot. Rev is just an infrastructure of convenience that the slimy owner paid someone else to build. But like I said, if you are needing transcription done regularly, better hire someone."

Our company makes orders of between 100 and 200 videos to be captioned at a time, and inevitably a few of them seem to not 'parse' when adding the Vimeo links to Rev. The error message says it's privacy settings, but all our videos have exactly the same settings.

BTW, my clients span the globe so the accents are sometimes tricky but the result is still excellent. I often just use the Automated service because I need only to pick up on key ideas. The website is a dream with a simple layout and clear instructions even for first-time users. And having a history of my uploads is quite handy. Turnaround is excellent. My business depends on Rev and I'm quite grateful for this professional service."
