I am not going to spend hours and days to fix their problems and have interrupted calls. I understand that they may have probs but the key is how you handle them. Rebtel would not even address my request to give me break/discount....so I will be cancelling their service. Rebtel does not care about the customer ! They just charge the monthly fee whether there is a good service or not, do not expect any refund etc. So be aware !"

          "Contenu": "I recently had a terrible experience with Rebtel, a company I previously used to send phone loads to my relatives in the Philippines and Mexico. Unfortunately, my identity was stolen and sold on the black web, which led me to cancel my cell phone number and switch to a new provider with a new number. One day, I needed to send a load to the Philippines and logged in to Rebtel to enter the code for recharging. However, the screen repeatedly indicated that the code was incorrect even after requesting a new one. In a panic, because my wife was on an emergency call in the Philippines and her phone was running out of load, I created a new account on Rebtel's website. Although the process appeared to be successful, the account was locked, and I was unable to send the emergency load. I tried to contact Rebtel via email, but it took days for them to respond, and their solution was unsatisfactory because they requested personal information that could compromise my identity. As a victim of identity theft, I was unwilling to disclose that type of sensitive information. Furthermore, Rebtel charged my credit card $1 US dollar, which I assumed was to confirm that the credit card was valid. Unfortunately, I was wrong, and my account was locked. I informed Rebtel that I was an existing customer and that I was recharging a phone registered in their system. I explained that I had created a new account with a different number and device because I could not log in to my original account. However, my new account was still locked, and Rebtel's support team was unhelpful. In my opinion, Rebtel needs to establish a foolproof system of checks and balances, such as two-step authentication, a code sent to the registered email, or Rebtel App approvals, to verify a person's identity. I don't think it's fair to treat customers like criminals just for doing business with them. Finally, I found another company in the Philippines that provided better prices than Rebtel. They charged only $8.70 US dollars for 1000 5G minutes, compared to Rebtel's $10.20 US dollars for 500 minutes. As a result, I decided to switch and say goodbye to Rebtel."

Rebtel billed me for for 3 calls to *one* number in Scotland during their supposed \"free trial week\" that they offer after downloading their app. I'm disgusted by Rebtel--I just cancelled my Rebtel account to cut my losses. Rebtel later justified their bait and switch because I called what *they allege* was a \"premium number or special rate number\". Rebtel failed to define what such numbers are, so I asked Rebtel how would I be able to identify such a number? No answer from Rebtel.Rebtel's customer service persisted in answering me in their corporate-speak about how they \"understand it's frustrating to have to pay...\" Ahem. It's not just frustrating Rebtel, it's maddening to be mislead. Free is free. Furthermore, I have never been billed for a \"premium number or special rate number\". In cell telephone or landline life, those are not billing categories."

Upon my request to resolve the issue, I was asked to send a copy of my credit card statement and an identification document. I sent those right away. In the afternoon of February 24, upon my pursuit, they responded saying they are still working on my case. Is it rare to use a local SIM card while travelling? I use Uber with the same Colombia phone number and the same credit card registered at my home address in Canada. It works fine. I think Rebtel needs to upgrade their system to accommodate travellers who use a SIM card of the country/city they are in at the time of purchase.Malik Rashid"

          "Contenu": "I had a poor experience with the resolution of my issue which I had to endure for a month and a half. A particular number I was calling all of a sudden stopped working as the call wasn't getting through to the other side. One agent said that the number was a 'premium' and I am not allowed to use Rebtel to call that number using Rebtel. However, person in the other end couldn't afford such a number but the agent was adamant given the 'tools' they use say that. Then they said, no it's just they have incorrectly tagged the number as a premium and did something from their end where I could call the number twice. The issue returned and tried various options suggested by the agent to no avail. Then they suggested there's nothing wrong in their end but the person I am trying to call has blocked me! Another bizarre finding through their tools as it turned out to be I suppose. Meantime I've purchased another service and managed to make multiple calls to the said person. Now they are asking for my personal call logs to verify that I really have made successful calls to that number so they can make a case to 'convice' their tech team to look into the issue. This is another level, if they want this kind of data just to convince the technical team what's the point of using that service! Showing a 2 min or 5 min log of a call from a service that is not Rebtel, how do they intend to use that data other than to prove the customer isn't lying which certainly isn't the case in mine. Anyway, enough is enough so terminated the service and WOULD NOTrecommend this to anyone else."

When I ask customer service what is going on and why, they do not answer the question, they just demand I send them my bank statements, photo ID and digits of my credit card (the same one they\u2019ve been stealing my money from). I take curent screen shots of my credit card online account and redact everything aside from the fraudulent charges and give the last 4 digits of my credit card in enlarged bold print and I also include a screen shot of the confirmation of cancellation. I send this to them and continually, they keep demanding I send my ID and the information I\u2019ve already sent and then now asking what country I\u2019m in so they can steal more and more.    So, we all know what identity theft is right? Are you going to voluntarily give your Photo ID, credit card and bank statements to someone that has been robbing you? I work for a global news outlet and am seriously considering having a story on this to warn everyone away from this company."

When I call the number listed for Sweden - +46 8 50321100 - it just disconnects or says the number is not in use. Did you change your Sweden Access Number or what is going on? It can't be only me affected by this in Sweden. Without the possibility to use your Access Number in Sweden I cannot use your services... Among the by Rebtel listed Access Numbers there is ONLY ONE SWEDEN NUMBER, +46 8 50321100. This is the number I was using since years to call with Rebtel. Also, all the other Local Numbers I created through Rebtel webpage on my account were different versions of this number. NOW NOTHING CONNECTS! I can not use Rebtel since the Access Number in Sweden does not respond..Please help Mark Lowell (you are my last resort)!"

          "Contenu": "I was excited to try Rebtel's service for international calls, as I had heard good things about the company from friends and family. However, my experience with Rebtel was nothing short of a nightmare.After signing up for the service and purchasing a package, I eagerly awaited my local numbers so that I could start making calls to my loved ones. However, things quickly went downhill.Every time I tried to make a call, it took an excessively long time to connect. I found myself constantly redialing and waiting on hold, only to be told that the connection could not be established. It was incredibly frustrating, especially considering the high price I was paying for this service.I reached out to Rebtel's customer service multiple times, hoping for some assistance. However, the representatives were unable to resolve the issue and seemed to have little knowledge or understanding of the problems I was experiencing.After several weeks of struggling with Rebtel's service, I finally decided to switch to a different provider. It was a tough decision, as I had already invested a significant amount of money in Rebtel's package. However, I simply couldn't continue to deal with the constant issues and lack of support.I am extremely disappointed with my experience with Rebtel. Not only did their service fail to deliver the reliable connection I was expecting, but their customer support was completely inadequate. I would not recommend this company to anyone, as there are much better options available for international calls."

The quick answer is a monopoly and lack of competition. I place international calls via the Rebtel app to older relatives/family friends who reside in rural parts of developing countries and are not tech-savvy enough to utilize WhatsApp, FaceTime, and/or apps for making international calls except for Rebtel.So, in a way, I continue to use Rebtel to call such individuals because I am stuck with it."

If I phone not using Rebtel yes it's extremely expensive but at least I get a complete call experience and not phone roulette. Come on Rebtel! Coincidently it's gone downhill when you changed your logo and aptly put a woman screaming in frustration on your Facebook cover page!? (Lol)"

When someone disconnects the call, it gets automatically redialed.2. When for some reason, like receiver's mobile is switched off or out of network, you cannot hear the default company responses but hear the normal dial tone.3. If someone has set some beautiful caller tune, you cannot hear that but just the normal dial tone.In general, whatever the situation might be, you always hear the dial tone and can't understand if something is different at receiver's end.I informed their support and according to them, they are aware of the fact and will fix it in near future. I have been their customer since 1 year but this issue seems to be as it was."

However, I was charged at 41p/min because it's a special number!After getting in touch with Rebtel, they explained that special numbers are not included in their usual package (either in the pay as you go or the Unlimited package). However, I was not made aware of this upfront and the detail about special numbers is buried deep in the T&Cs...Helpfully, the customer service rep (Karl Maintang) still refunded me my credit for the 'special number' call and hopefully will pass on this feedback to the product/dev team."
