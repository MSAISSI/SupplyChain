Shipping it anyways and then I have to request the refund and pay to return the item. The customer service is either a bot or they're required to send scripted responses"

          "Contenu": "A4C has the worst customer service I have ever encountered. I have contacted them numerous times but still with no response. I purchased 2 items from them with the supposed 3 to 5 days delivery but they opt to choose DHL, which is a minimum 8 days delivery from their place in Texas to my location in Southern California. I contacted them on day 8 regarding delivery time, no response until 2 days later, after DHL hand the packages off to USPS, a delivery partner of DHL.It then took USPS 2 more days to mis mark the deliveries. I contacted A4C again and raised the concern of usps marked the packages as delivered but was not. A4C told me to wait for 2 more days as usps may mis mark the delivery but it usually arrives in the next 2 days.I waited, for 2 days, to contact A4C again. This time no response at all. I filed a claim with usps, sent another email to A4C telling them what I did, and asked them to also step in and check with shipping partner to push the concern. But of course no one answered. I waited for another 3 days, usps replied they have misdelivered to the wrong mailbox and advice me to contact the merchant. I attached the emails from usps to A4C, seeking resolutions, but still no response. I sent in another email asking for a resolution or I\u2019ll have no choice but to dispute the charge. Told them I don\u2019t want to take this route and don\u2019t want to ruin their online reputation by having to write a negative review. Till today, it\u2019s almost been a month, still no one responded. I honestly don\u2019t know how I can recommend this business to anyone. Nor how can I hold myself back from leaving this review. It\u2019s been a month and A4C still owe me hundreds of dollars, or products, or an answer. The worst part is they choose to hide and disappear, other than stepping up to take care of the problem. This is the worst online company I have ever dealt with, and I warn everyone to stay away from dealing business with them."

It looks the same, and reviews mention the ability to charge a device wirelessly, but the one I received doesn\u2019t charge wirelessly. So I guess I got ripped or got a bad one. It\u2019s lot enough $$$ to bother returning it so I just suck it up and keep it. It works w cables just jot wirelessly which is why I got it. Shipping was reasonable and if I remember correctly it was also free. Coupon code from the article posting the deal was valid so no other issues just not quite the functionality advertised."

I  tagged to be notified when the new models are restored in inventory, but in the meantime this rebuilt charger works fine.  The cell phone is fully charged now."

I sent A4C support a request for a refund and received NO answer. However, I discovered yesterday that after rotating the iPad 180 degrees (the iPad can rotate in the case 360 degrees) the on/off feature and flap are working perfectly.  So the case magnets are happy now and I'm happy now, but I'm somewhat miffed at A4C's failure to respond."

The packaging was OK but in retrospect I should have gotten them from Amazon for $5 more.  I did get one that way and the extra money was worth piece of mind.  You see, I ordered an Asus tablet refurb from A4C in the past that didn't even work out of the box.   I swore to not use them again.  I always stick to my word on such matters.  I ordered the dots on accident, having forgotten the original source of the Asus tablet.  In short, I don't recommend A4C.  They have a 1.5 rating on reseller ratings.  Check it out."

          "Contenu": "It's okay.  The design isn't the greatest as the back wheels keep hitting the toddlers heels. The seat also sits low so it doesn't provide enough height to kick off with feet.  This would be great for very very young toddler if their motor skills are developed and coordinated enough due to the size of the product. My toddler is on the small size and this is a bit small for his use due to reasons above.  Also the back wheels looks like it can be folded like the front for easy low profile storing but if it can, then I haven't been able to figure it out how.  For the front wheels there's a clearly marked push slide button.The only great thing is, this is a refurb but it looks completely new.  Maybe I can pass it on to my nephew so he can start using it at a much younger age."

It was rejected due to being past the 30 day return policy.  However, Lacy reached out and was able to make an exception and authorize an RMA. I'm greatful that she took the time to go above and beyond to reconcile with an individual customer.  I commend their customer service for their resolution and thank you Lacy!"

The force that it took to create the dents can't be good for the internal hardware. The wear on the edges could have been caused by a case and doesn't affect the ipad's performance. Only time will tell if the dents will have an impact on the life of the device. I am very pleased with my purchases especially when you factor in the savings over a brand new decice."
