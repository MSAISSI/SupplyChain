Arrived at \u2018will call\u2019, they verified my ID and order number and said they\u2019d be out with the products shortly. 30-40 minutes after that, I was informed that they were unable to locate any of the products and it could be weeks before they could get replacements in. This is when I chose to cancel the order . The purpose of calling ahead was to avoid such an instance to occur. Now I\u2019m without product and wasted an afternoon for nothing."

I can\u2019t remember but I\u2019m sure if they look up the time and date my order was delivered they\u2019ll see it. I definitely don\u2019t want his taller partner getting in trouble since he was the most polite.\u2026  I got my Mom a washer here for Christmas as a gift I had it delivered I wanted her to have the full experience (instead of her or my dad installing it or picking it up) my mom greeted this short grinch politely and he looked bothered he even had to do his job to bring the washer down and pick up the old one. My mom was very uncomfortable in her own home that\u2019s unacceptable. He\u2019s been working for rcwilly for years, obviously RCWilly doesn\u2019t give a rats ass about the customer service because I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only person who has complained about his attitude. If you don\u2019t like your job get a new one. I will say that his partner on the other hand was polite and very kind and did most of the work he installed and uninstalled the washer and his responses weren\u2019t rude or annoyed."

          "Contenu": "I ordered a new appliance online, a dishwasher with the install kit plus the five year warranty. Upon completing the order online, there was no option to request the pickup of my old dishwasher appliance, nor an option to select an install for my new appliance. Hence I assumed both of these things would be completed automatically. Yet upon having the new appliance delivered to my home the delivery person wouldn't take the old appliance, they wouldn't complete the install of my new appliance. The delivery person wouldn't even bring the new appliance in to my home, they left it on the front porch! I called your Customer Service number only to have the customer service representative want to push me to a sales representative. During the call the customer service representative explained to me that I needed to request to have the old appliance taken even though there isn't an option online to do so! They then explained that I needed to request to have a third party complete the install, yet again I didn't see an option explaining that via your website. Overall this whole experience has been the worst I've ever had dealing with a major purchase of an appliance or furniture. My spouse and I over the years have purchased many items from your stores, including multiple couches, dining room tables, electronics, etc. I will never again shop with RC Willey having gone through this most recent dismal and upsetting experience!"

Wasn't used for 5 months - we've sat in it for six weeks and the cushions are collapsing. Supposedly it was under warranty but the manufacturer apparently says this is normal wear and tear. Even the technician RC Willey sent out took one look at it and said ' That's not right'. RC Willey refused to take any responsibility for selling substandard goods - refused any kind of recompense at all. Will NEVER use them again and will advise all my Park City friends to do the same."

To get a chair repaired that is still under warranty,  we had to pay an $89 fee at least 2 days in advance, which no one bothered to tell me when I made an appointment. Didn't find out until I had to change the appointment.  They won't give you any idea what time they're coming until the night before,  which means you have to make sure you have an entire day with nothing else to do but wait for them to come.  Add to that the fact that the repair people don't work Thursdays and Fridays and we had to schedule 3 weeks out. And we're retired-- what do people with jobs do? Terrible policy and we'll definitely think more than twice before shopping there again!"

I already had 2 Pedda stools from my other washer and dryer that they refused to put my new washer and dryer on.  Then I had to ask them for all the paperwork that goes with my washer and dryer, the one kid said that it should be in the machine.  Usually the paperwork comes in a plastic bag on the outside of the machine in the box when it is brand new.  the thing that pissed me off the most is the mess that they left in my yard, like all the Styrofoam pieces and garbage from them ripping the boxes off my washer and dryer.  Such bullcrap.  I have never experienced this kind of customer service with R.C. Willey's.Very disappointed"

The second CS agent said she left a message for him to call me but...I'm currently trying to chat with someone but still waiting for a response. It shouldn't be this hard to simply get a document sent to me.Another issue with me salesperson is that before I let him know I had made a decision, I had purchased the Blue Rewards on line. I have had this before. Well, the salesperson cancelled that order so he could add it to the invoice without asking me if that was ok to do. That is a clear manipulation without my permission. I'm assuming so he could get the credit for it. Thing is, I had already put his name on it anyway. Not ok with that."

We bought 2 couches, a bed frame, and a washer dryer. The couches were delayed for delivery and bed frame showed up but as we paid for delivery into our home, it was left on our porch. Nothing has gone as we requested on the delivery information which has made scheduling difficult. Carrying 100+ pound packages by yourself isn\u2019t fun either. The whole experience has put a bad taste towards RC Willey for us."

It had gouges, and when they delivered it, it just seemed like they wanted to get out of there before we could find anything wrong. Well about 4 months after we received the bed & nightstand my daughter sat on the bed, & it broke. My first reaction was it must have been the Chinese amish that made the bed because the amish take pride in their products. Well after about a month they sent a guy out to evaluate the situation, he totally agreed with us, and he was sorry for our inconvenience. Once he sent the report in, along with the pictures he took. The management contacted us with the decision they would give us a credit for the bed, but they would charge us with a 25% restocking fee for the night stand. In my opinion they should have given us a full cash refund , for everything. The given us a $500.00 credit for our inconvenience. My wife and I have spent thousands of dollars there over the last 40 years. We will never shop there again."

          "Contenu": "We bought two sofas in April. By May we could tell they were prematurely pilling, and by September we had a rep come out and look at them. They took a bunch of pictures and agreed that they are falling apart. The cushions are losing their umph, they are pilling all over, and there are strings coming out of the fabric. They offered us a replacement. We don\u2019t want another set of a couch that is falling apart. They said they can only offer store credit, so I spent three hours wandering the store trying to find another set that met my criteria. I came away frustrated and empty handed.  I don\u2019t want store credit, I just want a refund and to be done. I paid $2100 for couches, and they lasted less than 4 months. NOT happy. I can understand the policy if I had just changed my mind, or if it had been a few years and the couches didn\u2019t fully last through warranty. It\u2019s been four months, the product failed. A full refund should be standard."

I ordered a bedroom set several weeks ago and it was supposed to be delivered today by 3:45.  I received a call 2 hours later that I would not be getting my delivery today after all and I would have to reschedule.  ThIs is unacceptable. I scheduled this delivery weeks ago and now have to wait longer.  RC Willey\u2019s delivery department is awful. They need to be more realistic with there scheduling. They are always late unless you are early in the day and then cancelled at the last minute. Unbelievable.  My last delivery was not much better. The delivery man refused to put my sectional together claiming they don\u2019t do that on carpet.  I let that one slide but now I am convinced it is time to try another company for my future purchases"

          "Contenu": "I wish we could give 5 stars, but our experience was actually terrible.  It started off great, we got sold a beautiful couch.  It was down hill from there and I mean WAY down hill.  We arranged to pick-up the couch (as we live 4 hours away).  We had a family function that morning, so we arrived 20 minutes before RC Willey opened, we had called the day before and said we were going to be there first thing and they said they'd have it ready.  It took us almost 2 hours to get our stuff, and we ended up missing part of the family function and they delayed it as long as they could for us.  The gal at the Layton Will Call was about as rude as I've ever experienced which was off putting as we'd just spent over $6k on this sectional. We took a trailer because it was a very large sectional with 6 pieces plus an ottoman.  We got home only to discover the largest corner piece was for an entirely different sectional, different color, shape, size.  RC Willey did end up sending a couple of guys up to exchange it.  Then we had 2 of the sectional pieces break in the same spot along the frames (they are just poorly built, with boards too small to support the span of the large sections.)  They ended up sending out a repair guy to fix the sectionals and ended up just replacing them altogether, but the replacement literally took months.  The replacement took place over two different trips because they didn't have one of the replacement pieces with them.  On the second trip, the poor drivers sat in our driveway for over 8 hours because their truck broke down and it took that long for RC Willey to send help.  I wish we could say better things, our sales person and his manager tried to be helpful, but at the end of the day it was enough for us to decide that we will never buy anything from RC Willey again.  It is worth noting that the sectional is no longer available and has since received horrible reviews, so at least we know we're not alone in our struggle."

Well he is not family and I have 3 sales orders over the 2 days I spent in the store, on an average of 6 hours,  My time is valuable, but I suppose Taylor's time was more valuable.  Will never but anything not recommend this store to anyone. The rest of the staff was kind and helpful.  But one sour apple and ruin the while basket.  One more note I was there with a male friend. And he closely watched her movement and the evil stares thinking we were a gay couple, so I think that story is worth more than this post.  Im sure the LGBT community will enjoy this."

My mother is disabled and sick and my father is 83 years old. The delivery service was so terrible and even told us to just cancel our order, they don\u2019t care\u2026. Appalling!!! Left my mom in tears and so shaky she ended up having another fall from being so weak a few hours later.We ended up buying a bed and an adjustable bed frame that was way out of her budget, but Ralph was so great and we needed the bed ASAP (again, due to mobility issues). I feel bad for these hard working sales people for the delivery service to leave such a sour taste!! Another thing Ralph did that I thought earned an extra star was text us afterwards to apologize, but it wasn\u2019t his fault. They really need to hire trained delivery people on customer service. Do not accept anything or sign for any delivery otherwise returning your product will be hell!! Thank goodness we dodged that bullet when the delivery service refused to help my parents remove their old furniture.Don\u2019t waste your time here, go to Living Spaces! They have updated styles and their employees don\u2019t work on commission. Living Spaces won\u2019t sell you anything you don\u2019t need and their delivery service is top notch! You don\u2019t have to move a thing or prep for their arrival. Sorry, not sorry, but we will never give RC Wiley our business again. Wish we asked around or read reviews before going there. Almost all of my friends agree how horrible it is and I\u2019ll help spread the word as well."

But delivery (and this is paying for the high end/white glove delivery service) has been a nightmare. We finally settled on a couch created from 2 very wide recliners, and this is our first experience with a motorized recliner. This is not a budget couch, and it's not like they haven't made money from this purchase. The problem arose when the delivery was made and it turned out that one of the motors would not work. We planned for a second try just to replace the side that was broken. This was another 3 day wait. What happened here? They brought the wrong part (ie, they brought a second of the side that was working just fine). We tried to call to see if we could do something that wouldn't necessitate us going to the back of the line in terms of delivery date. My husband called and got on the call back list (where they call you so you don't have to wait on the phone). 7 hours later, they haven't called. Tried again and was told to call Karen, who wasn't working that day and said she couldn't help us. Tried again, got bounced around a bit and finally just had to be happy with another 3-4 day wait. This is totally unacceptable but we were so sick of trying to get this problem fixed we gave up for the day. It's not like they're the DI. Price was decently into the 4 figures. After they made mistakes twice with delivery, it's really on them to expedite getting our couch to us in working order. Gee whiz, offer us our delivery fee back or, better, don't make us wait another 3-4 days for our couch. Show us you're being accountable and value our business. Really angry"

          "Contenu": "As a furniture store I have no complaints.  It is the service and or outside company they use to delivery or install, i.e. appliances.  Just bought a gas dryer late last month.  Installers were young and I could see somewhat rushed.  I specifically told the chap that was attaching the dryer to make certain the vent hose was secure in the wall.  Two days ago I saw that it had come apart and away from the wall.  I was shocked and upset because I had used my dryer before noticing and I have no idea how long the hose had been like this.  We all know that using a gas dryer without a vent hose is not an option. If you operate a dryer without such a vent hose, moisture and lint can accumulate in the machine, potentially resulting in a fire. I was able to look at the hose and noticed that a ring is missing at the end of the hose that goes into wall.  Without this ring there is no way the hose will stay put.  I can only think the chap that was here was new and frankly had no idea on how to attach. THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THIS.  Impossible to do any laundry until corrected. I called immediately for service and was told nothing available for Saturday and Sunday and Monday the delivery/repair  company does not work.  Frankly, the inconvenience of this suggests strongly that I will never, ever purchase another appliance from R.C. Willey.  They need to address this and perhaps switch to a different outside company."

Just said, \"Oh no, you have to wait a day for them to be active.\"  I reexplained the issue to support -- I was put on hold while she \"checked with the IT guys,\" then moments later assured me that, \"You just have to wait.\"  Explained to her that I had already received the gift card but it was only one.  Why would one process in 18 seconds and one take 24 hours?  Well, 24 hours later, big surprise I don't have the second gift card and my mother never received an automated notification of even the one gift card.I try to support small business but (a) RC Willey is a big enough shop that this really shouldn't be happening in the first place, and (b) the customer service response was so unbelievably dismissive, I cannot see me ever shopping there again even for mom who loves the place."

She was never anywhere to be found because she was helping so many other people. We were there way too unnecessarily long. When I finally found her she was rushing me, telling me the furniture manager was after her to hurry up with me because she needed to go help some elderly couple in dining. I no longer work there, and I am a paying customer. I should have gotten the same one on one experience anybody else walking through that store gets. Anyways, very disappointed! We went to Bob's furniture and found way better items and bought them. We will be canceling our furniture order of a little over 3,000 today. On a separate note. We also bought a washer and dryer from Josephine Santos. EXCELLENT SERVICE!!!! she never left our side and we picked out what we wanted and was in and out of there! We are keeping that purchase.

We cancel excellent plans for the evenings (both times).  Later in the evening we receive notice that delivery is now 7:15 pm to 9:15 pm.  Ya, right.  Keep in mind this happened two separate times.  I cannot believe a company like this can be so flippant about people's time.  They just kept stringing us along.  No concern whatsoever for our time.  Just RUDE!

The purchase itself was very easy and the delivery was prompt and on time. However both couches and recliner were damaged when they were unpacked in the truck. Not sure it was at the manufacturer or at the RC Willey warehouse. Usually I have a salesman to contact to get them returned. Since I bought online the delivery gentlemen said they were not sure how to go about the return."

When I finally decided on a table and chairs with RC Willey I just spoke to to the sales clerk and told her that I wanted the table. She looked on the website and found that it was in stock and set up the delivery for the next day available. It was efficient and fast. I had to call the main store to pay for it. The transaction went smooth. I will know for sure of my satisfaction when I receive the table in my kitchen. I appreciate the efficiency of all concerned thus far."

Unfortunately, the installation of the water line for the refrigerator was missed, and this was never given as an option during check-out.  The delivery coordinator did a great job of noticing that miss, correcting it, and crediting the cost.  Nice work!"

However, our last purchases in 2020 and 2021 both \u201cincluded\u201d a rewards program promise Blue Rewards? So during \u201ccheckout\u201d no mention of rewards discounts or free delivery etc, etc, etc were mentioned or adjustments made to our purchase price for these earned rewards from past purchases?  So I went to the cashier window and asked for my rewards balance?? No records were found and I was advised that I was emailed reward documents that needed to be presented at time of purchase??? What a pain in the Fanny!Who does that - those credits should be reflected in my account - they are for my airline and hotel miles. So I receive no rewards for my washer/dryer/love seat/recliner/2 area rug/ and carpet with install over the last 3 years. I went in my email and found one \u201creward\u201d notice that wanted me to register for the program.  Why should that be necessary - to receive promotion emails which I get routinely as a result of my account information. Registration should be automatic and rewards banked \u2014 my opinion is this is a promotional joke!!! And future RC WILLEY shopping my be considered more carefully.RC Willey read and responded to my concerns. My understanding of the program was flawed - however,  prior rewards were documented and awarded to my purchase after management review. I\u2019ve raised my rating because my value experience at the store has always been fantastic - this mix up was corrected promptly and effectively."

They were shipped in a timely manner and I received shipment and delivery notices.  3 of the 4 boxes were received in good shape. 1 box looked dropped on a top corner.  Upon opening - great instructions and they were easy to put together. There was one broken part.  I sent an email as it was a holiday weekend about the broken part and I received a call early the next business day.  The part was shipped and received in good order.  My only other problem was a tape that was around the seat backs - when taken off - it removed some of the finish on the edges the width of the tape. This happened on 3 of 4.  Now - I\u2019ve taken a sharpie and can hardly tell where that was.  The 4th chair thankfully didn\u2019t have this tape. There is one more thing - there is one corner of a seat back that is dented  - probably from that drop referred to above. Could have been from the store or a shipper - but not large enough to get another seat back. Because of the tape- the stools are not pristine perfect - but they are beautiful and complimented by company. Comfortable, look good, great swivel, and easy to put together.   I highly recommend."

          "Contenu": "You better hope that you never need any sort of follow up with this company, otherwise you are screwed.   I got my washer/dryer delivered in February 2023. RCWILLEY brought them over (their delivery lads are lovely), and I was supposed to have installation of new washer/dryer and removal of old appliances.  The delivery folks couldn't install my washer as I had a leak in my plumbing... Ok not their fault.   I called their customer service that day and they told me that \"yes, once my plumbing is fixed they can come back and finish installing my new washer and remove the old one.\" It's Reno, we've had horrible weather this last month.  I couldn't get a plumber in until last week (first week of March).   I called Thursday to get my order finished up, I'm bounced around to every department and given a number for Lisa.   I leave a message for Lisa.   I get no call back.  I called on Friday, bounced around again.  Saturday, bounced around again.  I leave a request for some sort of human who knows what they're doing to call me back on their email support system.  Do I get a response?  NO.  I've ordered multiple purchases from this company throughout the years.  Their lack of customer service and zero response has urged me to NEVER do business with them again.  Think maybe if I flame them online and file something with BBB they'll actually come in and install my damn washer like I paid them to do??UPDATE ON 03/16/23: I spoke with Appliances manager Caplan (sorry if misspelled) on 03/14/23 as they had seen my nasty review on trustpilot.  He was friendly and let me vent a little bit about the sucky phone tag I had to play.  He got me scheduled to have delivery folks come back in to get my washer installed, and they came today so I'm updating my review.  I'm giving RCWilley experience 4 stars for three reasons.  1:  YOUR PHONE ETIQUETTE WHEN A CUSTOMER CALLS INTO YOUR MAIN STORE WITH A PROBLEM SUCKS.   If someone doesn't really know what to do with you, they just transfer you around endlessly until you give up.    Once you finally do get someone on the phone who knows what they're doing, they're great.  Always friendly.  But it's the getting to someone who can help that is the issue.  2: When I purchased my washer/dryer, the website did NOT tell me I needed hoses/vents for installation.  Best Buy (oh yah, I'm mentioning them) automatically adds the items to the cart and you have to manually remove them if they aren't needed.  I ended up buying from RCWilley because I always have good experiences with deliveries and had (previously) never had a problem with the company.    NO I was not aware that I needed those items, and adding some hard-to-see \"suggested\" items on your website isn't cutting it, RCW.   3:  I shouldn't have to write out a public nasty online to get some results.   I personally don't really like complaining loudly in public, particularly about companies I really like, it makes me feel uncomfy like I'm an evil witch.  But I felt it was the only way I could get someone to contact me back! Your positives are:  Once you get someone on the phone they're lovely.  Delivery folks are always great, and the items I've purchased in the past (chairs, dining set, loveseat, washer/dryer) are always good quality and price."

When I removed a shelf to adjust its placement, a long hair was trapped behind it. Not my hair nor the delivery gentlemen. In the future, I would like to know when I order an item from RC Willey if it has been refurbished or had been previously bought and returned by another customer."

Bob Pearson greeted us kindly and we started looking at the refrigerator selection.  Bob was excellent at helping in our selection and most importantly assisting us in a quick delivery.  In less than 1 hour from the time of purchase the new refrigerator was delivered and installed.  Ricardo and Jake on the delivery truck were super and disposed of the old fridge and installed the new fridge in no time.  Everyone was extremely professional and save my family's thanksgiving weekend.  I cannot thank Bob, Ricardo, and Jake enough for their efforts in getting the new fridge delivered and installed so quickly."

We were in the process of buying a new home and went to RC Willey to look at furniture and get ideas.    Upon arriving we were greeted by salesperson Michael McDuffie who was extremely knowlegable, friendly, professional and beyond helpful!  He spent several hours with us going over sectionals, tables, and dining room tables. We knew once we purchased our home we would be back to buy furniture. There was a dining room table and sideboard that we really loved but it was out of stock.  We signed up for email notifications to alert us when it would come back in stock (fingers crossed that it would!)  A few weeks later it did and I immediately reached out to Michael about it, he took care of everything and today we have our beautiful dining room table and matching sideboard in our new home!  We couldnt be happier!  Michael ensured from start to finish that the whole transaction was entered, ordered and completed.  We are 100% satisifed and highly recommend Michael McDuffie for all your shopping needs at the Summerlin location! He is a true professional and that speaks volumes for superior customer service!  Thank you Michael and RC Willey for a positive shopping experience!  April and Terry"
