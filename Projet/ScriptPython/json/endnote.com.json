Frankly, it's the pits. It's overpriced, isn't compatible with OneDrive/the cloud, and is clunky when citing directly from your browser. As it's so expensive, it's baffling that free products such as Zotero and Mendeley are so much better in every way. I just spent $247 for the program and now I've got to spend another $150 or so to upgrade to a cloud-compatible version. It screws up my documents in sometimes inexplicable ways, in which even tech support can't figure out, costing me well over $1000 in lost time and work since downloading in Feb 2023. I'm not sure why large institutions go all in on EndNote, leaving employees/researchers stuck with a crummy tool that isn't user friendly. Stick to Zotero if you don't need to work in Word Online or Mendeley if you do."

Second, and related, I used to be able to delete a section in my version of the reference and then hit \"Update Empty Fields\" and continue editing, but now the program closes the whole window.   Third, if I'm searching for a reference, I used to be able to type in, say, an author's name, then hit the tab button to get to the next search field.  Now, however, the tab button takes me out of the search windows and into the list of references, which is inconvenient.   Thanks."

EndNote is a great program that makes organizing PDFs a snap, cite while you write, change formatting, etc.  The improvements over the years (e.g., clicking a button to get PDFs) have be the icing on the icing of a great cake.  I would like to have a greater proportion of PDFs \"linkable\" with a \"click\" although that probably has more to do with journals than with EndNote.  I really have no complaints!"
