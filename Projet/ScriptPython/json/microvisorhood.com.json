          "Contenu": "I installed the hood about two months ago and have used it a few times since then. The hood seems to help, but not as much as I had hoped. For me, sticking out another inch or two would have helped. And the back is just held on with magnets, which are too small in my mind. But the biggest issue is that last night when using it, the hood almost fell off. Two of the three screws holding the hood to the microwave came out; they were not under tightened they just came loose from the microwave as if they were the wrong size. So now I have an expensive door stop."

The product describes itself as a filter, but is simply a hood, and a very expensive piece of metal. The return policy is very limited. You have to pay to ship it back and pay an $18 or $35 \"restocking\" fee. I inserted the hood once which produced scratches where the hood contacts the insertion clips. These scratches could make the product non-returnable."

I was very dissatisfied with it, as it only captured a minimal amount of steam from the front burners of my induction range (maybe a 10% improvement). When I called Microvisor to inquire about a return, I spoke to a man named George who informed me that they will not refund me, as the product was used. After arguing with him for a few minutes and listening to him attempt to belittle me, he finally agreed to accept the return and refund me (minus the $18 restocking fee)."

He said to use the thumbscrew and remove it while cookin ony takes 30 seconds. Really I bought this to take off when cooking? The company does not tell you that if the microwave is not flush with the bottom of the cabinets, it sets to low to safety use. Brother this guy started his BS by saying everyone's home is different, really why would you not say that in your ad. When I told him I would like to return the microvisior for a refund he stated that to read the return policy and there would be an $18.00 restock fee. He also said that if it was used it was like returning tennis shoes that had been worn. Wow this company is not honest, once they get your money it's all over. BE SURE TO READ THE RETURN OPTION BE FORE BUYING!! AND BUYERS BEWARE IF YOUR MICORWAVE SITS BELOW THE CABINETS IT WILL NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY. Of course you could do as he told me and remove it when cooking. I will never buy from this guy again. Also the customer service email does not work. I called several time before I got that idiot on the phone. I also want to apologize for giving a 1 star review."

A lafy answered with \"hello\" and said he wasn't home at the time I called.) advised that that's why he made it removable and was very rude on top of that. It makes no sense to me. If I have to remove it to reach my back burners what purpose does it serve when I still have the issue with the front burners in order to reach the back?  When finally told I could return it but packaging and everything had to be perfect I got stuck with the product because my cat scratched on the styrofoam. I could not, in good conscience, sell the product to someone else without telling them tge truth about the product, so yeah, I'm definitely stuck with it."

          "Titre": "Unreasonable Return Policy",
          "Contenu": "After receiving the product, I opened the package to review its contents.  The hood looked a little wider than anticipated.  Also, since my oven was curved, I wondered how the hood would look.  So I placed the hood up to the oven to see how it would look (with the bracket as well).  No mechanical fastening took place; just lifted it up to the oven to have my wife view how it looked.  It did not look good and we concluded it would be a safety issue for our young child and elderly parent.After requesting the return policies the very next day via email, I received a response email and was notified about the stringent return guidelines (for the first time).  Essentially, one cannot even open the package and touch the hood.  I'm exaggerating, but essentially the company noted any scratch whatsoever would void the any refund.After reading the email and the attached photos, I called to find out if this was really happening.  The gentleman repeating their policy, noting that even if the unit is not mechanically fastened/installed, it did not matter.  Even putting the hood into the bracket on a table would void the refund as the hood would be \"scratched\" (although could not be visible because the \"scratched\" portion would be in the bracket and hidden).  Regardless, I noted I did not know of this stringent return policy to which he noted it was on the website.  I noted I did not see it and that, at a minimum, it should have been with the instructions or somewhere in the box as is common practice.  Not everyone looks for return policies on websites, especially since most people visit websites to place orders.So, after having to pay about $30 to return the hood and another $10-$20 (don't remember), I just received the hood back.  FYI, it took almost 4 weeks from the date I returned it.My recommendation to avoid any future issues:  place the stringent return policies in the box along with the installation instructions.  If this would add to your costs, I would recommend replacing IT for the advertisement you place in the box for a free hood in exchange for a Youtube video; at least put the ad in regular stock paper in lieu of the heavy card stock.  No added costs would be incurred and the consumer would be protected.  Had I known of this stringent return policy, I would never have placed the hood into the bracket (by hand on my table).  BTW, I keep using the word stringent because I am a SME (subject matter expert); I've been in quality control for years (most of my tenure at the corporate level)."

Made a bigger mess than before.  Also cuts off any overhead light that you might have so you're now cooking in worse shadow than before.  It probably won't stay up much longer."

It definitely reduces cooking odors but won't capture all of them (they are clear about this in advertising so believe it).  The house can still be stinky after some types of foods but the intensity of cooking odors are greatly reduced.  I use an odor eliminating candle occasionally and that helps.  I wanted to replace my microwave with a range hood; however, the way the microwave is attached would require a contractor to remove it and redo the tile.  The Microvisor Hood is a viable option.  You can't go wrong with getting this item.  Shipping was fast and I suspect the company has a good customer service department from the positive reviews although I did not need to contact them."

Works as described and has really made cooking a more enjoyable experience now that we worry less about setting the fire alarm off or raising the indoor AQI (we have a detector) too much.  We have birds which are very sensitive to AQI.  The only constructive criticism I have is that I immediately did not trust mounting this with the hardware present on my microwave.  I decided to drill out a bar existing on the microwave, install 3 m6 rivnuts and then enlarged the holes through everything in order to really get a solid mount.  I had some left over automotive m6 bolts with a philips drive, which made it possible to install without having to modify the provided mounting bar much.  My wife and I are a bit accident prone and we've already bumped the hood a few times, I'm really happy with how solid it is now."

We really like the product.A few things to improve:1) MicroVisor edges are little sharp and smoothening them will make better user experience while installing.2) Center lock screw doesn\u2019t come off easily.Looking forward for motorized MicroVisor extension. Great product and good service."

          "Contenu": "Packaged well and delivered very quickly. Assembly was extremely easy, just screw the mount into the bottom of your OTR microwave and then insert the visor and the locking pin. Less than 5 minute install.My only complaint is that the single locking pin between the visor and the mount doesn't hold the visor completely steady. Hitting the edge of the visor gives it a noticeable amount of wobble, and there's a small amount of in-and-out play in the visor when mounted. You can push/pull it ever so slightly around after it's been mounted and secured.Functionally this thing does exactly what it's supposed to. It very clearly helps capture steam and move it towards my microwaves fan when cooking on the stove top. I recommend this product, although I would like to see an additional security pin for the visor to the mount. The single pin doesn't hold it as securely as I'd like."

I was not sure if going 3/4 inches into our microwave  would get close to anything electrical inside. I am very impressed by the detail built into the visor. Smooth edges, very good stainless steel thickness, and a threaded knurled screw which locks the visor in place, once the receiving nut is engaged.Finding the shorter screws took longer than installing the unit. The look is classy, and my wife is happy with its appearance and function."

I am 5'9\", and the visor does not impede my ability to see all the burners when I am cooking. Then I started cooking.  I am very pleased to say that the visor did a fabulous job redirecting the smoke from all my pans to the vent at the rear of the stovetop. I honestly did not expect such a drastic improvement, but for my situation, the visor works. The best part was not hearing the smoke alarm go off!Thank you!"

          "Contenu": "I was able to purchase a refurbished Microvisor Hood on the last day of February for a reduced price. Due to some negative reviews I wanted to give it a try, but not at full price. The hood was very well packaged and arrived very quickly. It was in perfect condition, lightweight, easy to handle, and I was able to install it in a few minutes. I have had it for a few weeks now and have to say it works very well. It's keeping my microwave and upper cabinets clean. I pulled my microwave fan filters to clean after using for a week or so and they do seem to be pulling in a lot more grease. I have also noticed that the underside of the hood has grease and condensation spots so it is working to keep cooking steam more contained. Does it keep everything contained? No, but it's a great improvement in my kitchen. It does obstruct my view of the stove knobs a little (they are on the back of the stove), but I just duck down to adjust them and that minor inconvenience is more than worth it in my opinion. The only thing that would be an improvement would be to have a full-sized outside vented fan instead of a microwave, but my very small kitchen is not very accommodating to that scenario.Thank You Microvisor Hood for helping to provide a solution to a very annoying kitchen problem."

And I ordered it express 2 day shipping! So I emailed customer support the next business day, which was Monday, and immediately received an automated response which provided me with a phone number to call if I choose to do so. Quickly, a man whose name I cannot remember, asked me if he could be of assistance. I explained to him I made a mistake on my 2 day order and he asked for my order# and how I would like my situation to be resolved. I told him which model I ordered, and the model I wanted, and he said he would take care of it. NOW HERE'S WHAT SETS MICROVISOR HOOD APART FROM THE REST! About 10 minutes later, I logged into my account to check my order...AND IT WAS THE CORRECT ITEM!!! So here's a company that does what they say they're going to do, when they say they're going to do it, and did it swiftly with no problems at all. Super-Fast response and resolution. YOU CAN'T ASK FOR MORE THAN THAT FROM A COMPANY! Oh, yes you can. The visor works GREAT!!! Not to mention that it gives your Over The Range Microwave a look you won't see anywhere except in places where people bought the Microvisor Hood. OUTSTANDING COMPANY!!! OUTSTANDING SERVICE!!! OUTSTANDING PRODUCT!!! I HIT THE TRIFECTA WITH THIS ONE!"
