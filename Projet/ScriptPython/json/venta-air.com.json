          "Contenu": "Venta humidifier broke after 2 years. Tech told us to purchase 2 parts to fix which we did and it did work. We had to buy a new Venta and we asked if we could return the 2 parts and receive a credit. They said yes. Parts returned, no refund issued as of today's date. The woman who takes the orders & helps with troubleshooting loses her patience a bit and raises her voice to customer. When a person pays almost $500 for something, one expects it to last more than 2 years if properly cared for which it was. Thank you."

When you call for service you are usually greeted by an answering machine, and expected to leave a message and wait for someone to call you...if you miss that call, there's no followup, you need to call again and leave another message.Replacing the motor is not as \"easy\" as the manufacturer claims, and this machine was clearly designed to be made difficult to disassemble. After spending money on a new cob wheel, and motor, I ended up throwing this piece of junk in the garbage.  Never again. Good riddance."

It was sealed lackadaisically with the bare minimum of clear tape, which had torn loose at both ends but was still attached across most of the flaps, which is a good thing for you cuz otherwise I'd be filing any angry claim for replacement instead of just a 1-star review.  I was amazed that all of the contents seemed to be in there and undamaged, considering."

November 2022, time to turn it on -- current flows to motor, lights flash for a second and then nothing.   Called customer service.  Rep tells me that based on my description of what's happening, it is a failed motor.   Cost to replace, now that I am out of the two year warranty (used to be a ten year warranty, but not any more):  $120.63 plus tax.    How could this have happened?  It worked OK and now it just won't start?   Her response \"They just sometimes go bad.\"  Really,  so now, two months out of the two year warranty, with what is clearly a defective motor, I am required to purchase a new motor, oh, and, do the replacement operation myself.   Absolutely no consideration given by Venta for this being what is so obviously a defective motor, and only two months out of warranty."

They didn't suggest any alternatives.I found a cord that works, powered it up and found that it didn't work. The hygiene disk was no good as all the sediment inside packed itself to one side, preventing it from turning in the humidifier. I again emailed Vanta and they suggested I either purchase a new disk or return my unit and buy direct from them. I chose to buy a new hygiene disk.I installed the new disk, ran it for a week and the humidity didn't go above 42% except when I turned on another humidifier. The entire time it was running in fan speed 5 in turbo mode. It's been a brisk winter so far, staying mostly above freezing. My home is roughly 1200 sq ft."

The item came on its own box that had a box cutter cut all across the box. As if that wasn\u2019t sufficient only one out of the three items ordered was shipped. I must have left at least 4 voicemail messages and sent at least a dozen emails to get it fixed with no avail. Emails to customer support and use of their website contact forms seem to get swallowed by a black hole. You as a customer is left out in the dark about what is going on with your order - they provide no updates or explanation. Then finally after a million emails a partial refund was issued but just for the airwasher - neither were the other two items ever shipped nor refunded. Customer care at this company is no care at all. To date issue has not been resolved and I had to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. Customer beware - do not buy from this company directly - order at Bed and Bath or Amazon where you can at least get decent customer service and be assured you will get what you paid for and properly refunded if need be!!"

The actual products Venta sells work OK but require a lot of your time to lug water and refill them daily and then the  machines require you to do a deep cleaning of them every 10-14 days which is very a time consuming and messy process, (about 1 hour per machine), and you have to BUY their cleaning products to use in doing it. You also have to buy their expensive water cleaning additive to then add to the refill water after you\u2019ve cleaned the machine and it not only costs a lot but is hard to locate and then you have to pay for the shipping costs on top of that because there are to local retail supply outlets. To make matters worse there are no local stores to get stuff from in regards to the frequent cleaning supplies required and or if repairs are need. Everything is a long-distance back and forth shipping process and they are anything but speedy or proficient. Their whole objective is to not only sell you an expensive item but once that is done they will have you locked in to having to buy a lot more stuff from them, (by long distance), at their high price so you can just run the machine."

I was never informed that Venta had changed their policy or I would have returned it. The 10 year warranty is both on the box and in the user manual. But now they said .........\"Our paper warranty registration applications as well as our manuals states \u201c10-year warranty\u201d which we do understand because we do have units that have a 10-year warranty. If you visit our website under \u201c Warranty\u201d you will see that it is only for a duration of 24 months. However, one can only quality for the 10-year warranty if the unit was purchased before August of 2020. Since you purchased your unit in October of 2020, you have a limited 2-year warranty.\" ...... This is just wrong ! We feel that the manufacturer of this product has misreppresented their product; if they had changed their warranty policy that information should have been communicated to prospective purchasers prior to the sale by changing the warranty information on the product box and manual. They also had the opportunity to advise us of a policy change when we registered our warranty on line and they did not."

          "Titre": "I ordered a venta comfort plus air\u2026",
          "Contenu": "I ordered a venta comfort plus air washer several weeks ago after reading good reviews about their products. In order to complete my purchase online and take advantage of their coupon code (which didn't work on Amazon) I had to order direct from the company and request a shipping address different from my billing address. I called for a week straight during their posted business hours and could not get a hold of customer service at all. I finally emailed them and quickly got a response and help with my order. So I place the order over the phone, confirmed everything with whom I was speaking, and then waited for the item. A week later it finally arrives and it's the wrong air washer!!! They sent me a cheaper version of the item I ordered. So then, I had to take time out of my day to contact them again, get a return label and return the item to UPS. So incredibly annoying. They even confirmed my order was correct and they shipped me the wrong item. I understand mistakes can be made, but they didn't even include an invoice with my order. That's pretty basic if you ask me. In addition, this might have all been avoided if they simply updated their website to include a spot for different shipping and billing address. It doesn't end here though, because in order for them to send me the correct product I was told I had to wait until they received the one I returned at their warehouse. They received it 3 days after I returned it according to UPS based on the tracking number. It's been a week since then and I still haven't received my order. I'm waiting on feedback today, but only because I had to keep emailing them to get a response. Completely ridiculous. I would have rather paid more and order from Amazon then deal with this. I really wanted to like this company, but having me be inconvencied and wait longer for something that is not my mistake is bad customer service."

Also, the two parts were shipped attached and packaged in a flat Fed Ex envelope which ultimately bent the rubber coupling. I think the shipping charge of  $7.95 for your estimated .5 pounds was too much, especially since part of that weight was for a piece I didn't really want.

However I LOVE the units, how effective they are in humidifying the dry air in my house during the winter, and how easy they are to maintain. I have owned these 3 Venta units for about 10 years and have never had an issue. I continue to recommend the units for humidifying a home and several friends and relatives have purchased units. And I will buy another when the need arises."

I have called multiple times today during their business hours and no one has ever answered. I left a voicemail and also emailed their customer service email. No one has responded to either message. The cleaning is already expensive ($119) and the inconvenience of not getting a mailing label, not being able to reach customer service through any channel, and a 6 week turnaround is all frustrating."

I even bought and used the  special Venta Cleaner which is also recommended once every six months.I thought with a bold \"10 year warranty\" displayed on the box, that my unit would at least be professionally inspected and cleaned by the manufacturer after only 3 months of use.Instead the person answering the customer service line and the manager completely blew my off, telling me I would have to pay for an Ultra sonic cleaning!Don't be misled by the claims that this product \"purifies for life and is easy to clean.\" I've had an awful experience.The response of customer care totally ignored the fact that, as I told them,  I had already cleaned my unit with vinegar and followed all the maintenance suggestions since I bought the unit.I have also  found out other customers had difficulty cleaning.

          "Titre": "Seriously ?",
          "Contenu": "My day started where I went onto the website to order a few $5 reasonably priced power supplies which I assumed would have been the easiest thing in the world as I\u2019ve ordered many small $5 Knick knacks off the internet with easy, speed and no problems. The easiest part of this experience is the checkout (right because everyone just wants their money) but I wasn\u2019t complaining since I had so many easy options to pay and that went great. Now here is where everything went downhill. I receive an email the next day stating immediate action required to finish my order, first I\u2019m thinking ok what\u2019s going on I paid, the site said in stock, what\u2019s up? So I spend the next day in the morning calling every 20 minutes for a couple hours trying to get thru their line with nothing but voicemail as if they don\u2019t have a job to pick up the phone. Finally I get thru and the person who answers the phone seems nice and attentive, then again here we go with the downhill part. First I\u2019m told that \u2018there is limited power supplies in stock\u2019 and that the other warehouse may have them. And I know that was all a bunch of bologna because the end result was getting my order shipped the next day but we\u2019ll get there. So next I\u2019m asked why and where I got my ventas because I needed power supplies, and if I would have known I signed up for 21 questions I wouldn\u2019t have wasted my time. Next, I had show \u2018proof\u2019 of purchases that I made in order to have my order completed. Now at this point I\u2019m seriously irritated. All this work for a five dollar item, being lied to, feeling as if I\u2019m some sort of criminal because all I did was order some items online from the comfort of my home like everyone else this day n age. It\u2019s like what else do you want from me, my social security number or my bank account like really come on. Anyways, I proceeded to email the screenshots of my proof of purchase and waste more of my time because at this point I didn\u2019t care and just wanted my stuff I ordered. It\u2019s been shipped, I hope there isn\u2019t a problem with that so I\u2019m still waiting and we\u2019ll see."

Maybe two of these would do it, but the cost is insane.  I might as well install a whole-house unit at that point.The fan is not well balanced and causes an uneven noise.  This means that in low or medium modes, you can hear random sounds that are too obviously random to qualify as comfortable white noise.  Can't sleep unless it's on high (because the fan gets fast and loud enough to hide the random sounds) or off.It's a cute piece of engineering but for the price, it's not good enough.  If I had paid only 15% of what I paid, I'd be happy with it.  Because I paid a fortune for what is mostly a plastic box and a fan, I am not happy with it."

My problem with Venta-USA is that this is the second time I have ordered both of these products and other than receiving a confirmation of order and a \"gee, it might take a while to receive it\", I have heard nothing. No updates, no anticipated date of arrival - nothing. The first time I was more willing to give them the benefit of the doubt regarding them having to wait for supplies on backorder. This second time around I am not feeling quite so generous. I have to wonder why the company has such a hard time keeping stock in hand and getting it out, inasmuch as these products are essential for my Airwashers. I'm becoming disgruntled with Venta-USA."

I found the reaction of the agent officious and unaccommodating.  Rather than empathizing with my gear part and rubber housing issues, I was tersely informed that \"no proof of purchase, no warranty -- read your warranty\".2. When I pointed out that one of my orders was made through Venta's online platform and gave an order number, the response was, sorry, we can't check that -- our systems have been changed and don't \"speak\" to each other.  This was made my problem rather than apologizing for it being Venta's problem.3,  I asked for the agent's name and s/he insisted on remaining anonymous -- this isn't best practice and doesn't create a personal connection with your company.  4.  I mentioned that I'd sent in warranty cards with serial numbers but was informed that these don't count when its comes to product support.5. I have had to dig through files to find the proofs of purchase and could only find two.  Now I feel bad that I won't be able to get support for my other 3 units."

          "Titre": "Sorry, but they are over priced and over-hyped",
          "Contenu": "Sorry, but I think these Venta units are over-priced and do not perform anywhere near as well as their specifications would have you believe.  The sq-ft rating for the units (I have been told by Venta) is determined in a closed lab setting with 8-foot ceilings.  If you have a perfectly tight house with those 8-foot ceilings then perhaps you will be satisfied with their \"real world\" performance.  I have a 1600 sq-ft house with 10-foot ceilings that is not perfectly \"tight\".  I was using both the Venta LW25 and and LW-45.  Both have been a disappointment compared to the performance of Ultrasonic and Evaporative humidifiers I have tried.  One feature of those Venta units that I consider a very poor design, and I did not think about when purchasing, is the side discharge of both units.  The humidified air exhausts horizontally front and back.  This makes placement of the units next to walls and furniture a potential problem for some.  I prefer units that exhaust up and out so that they can be placed close to walls, drapes, etc.  In addition, Venta states that the chemical additive does not evaporate and get in to the discharged humidified air.  If that is so then why does it keep leaving sticky deposits around the top of the tank and in other nooks and crannies even though I did not splash water in to these areas?  I have to clean the residue with a paper towel when I pull the top off to fill the tanks.  So I am certainly skeptical about that claim from Venta.  I gave my LW25 and LW45 to a friend to use and needed a replacement.  I purchased the LW60-T because it does have a vertical discharge and uses Hygiene Disks which eliminates the need to add their chemical solution to the water tank periodically.  The LW60-T also has a better coverage rating than both of my prior Venta units combined.  I liked the design of the unit, as far as the rollout tank and the noise level go.  However, after 39 days the disk stack in the unit stopped turning.  The gear that engages with and turns the disk stack was wobbly and freewheeling.  There had been some random clicking/chattering noises coming from the LW60-T before it died.  After some back and forth with customer service they agreed to send me a replacement unit.  I also found out that someone else had called in the same problem as I had that same day.  Reading between the lines in Amazon reviews there were one or two others that sounded like they had the same failure I had.  After I received the new replacement unit, filled it, then set it in operation ... it started the \"death rattle\" after just 6 hours in operation!  Same problem as the 1st.  Every time the rattling noise started, the disk stack stopped.  No disk stack, no humidification.  Obviously there is a design flaw, or a bad production run from the factory.  Inexcusable for a unit that cost me nearly $1000.  I got a refund for the Venta and purchased an Essic Airfare MA-1201, which humidifies better than the LW60. While the MA-1201 is noisier it cost me just $120, so I can live with that. The Aircare is an evaporative unit that humidifies the farthest corners of my house, which the Venta LW60 did not do.  I think I would have had to purchase the Venta LW62, at $1800, to get the same level of humidification that the Aircare MA-1201 provides me at $120.  A ridiculous price for what might have turned in to an expensive doorstop after a few hours of operation.But ,,, the customer service was good.  They worked with me, provided a fairly quick replacement, and finally agreed to the refund when the 2nd unit failed.  Too bad they do not actually manufacture the unit."

Also, it sometimes is very difficult to clean, with an odd somewhat sticky residue. (No one smokes).  We clean it every 2 weeks.  Otherwise it is quiet, efficient and keeps the humidity up in our large room."

Pretty much every company I call has an automated phone system that will keep me on hold until a representative can get to my call, so this felt very unprofessional in comparison. In the end, I decided to try and fix the unit myself. The good news is that the product is designed to be easily opened up and repaired by the end-user, which is exceedingly rare in this age of sealed and disposable products. I found repair information through Youtube videos and service documents on the website."

There is minimal directions on how to use the Auto function and when using it, it will run at low fan even thought the room is at the target humidity and it frequently runs the fan on high, sees the humidity jump near the unit then slows down to low then sees the humidity return to the room level and repeats.  Never had this issues with many prior humidifiers.  For the price, this unit should have a much better user interface, videos on Youtube on how to use it and ideally, a remote for measuring humidity away from the influence of the unit itself.  On the positive side, its easy to keep clean and refil and holds enough water for a few days between refills."

Machine will usually read about 50%, while hygrometer two feet away will read 40%All that being said, it does seem to raise the humidity about 4-7% in the immediate area when on full blast. I mainly bought this item so I wouldn't have to clean it all the time, and so far so good in that department. No gross buildup in the tank.For the enormous price tag I expect everything to be perfect, and so the  gaps in the housing, inaccurate hygrometer, and unresponsive customer service were all disappointing.

          "Contenu": "Manual could have more specific directions on differentiating automatic mode as only controlling the fan motor speed and turbo mode as maximizing fan motor speed but still subject to the \u201cset\u201d RH (which resets on changing modes).Water capacity is less than advertised as it accounts for filling bottom tray and water storage container, but bottom tray has no water making. The water tank itself has less capacity than its much cheaper LW45 counterpart.The room humidity is consistently 10% RH less than the two external digital hygrometers (one as part of a Dyson air purifier and the other as a stand alone) 20 feet away in the same room. Additionally, RH falls up to 17% below target humidity overnight when the heater runs most. NOTE: this is used in my 700 sq. ft finished basement so it should have the capacity to humidify the entire area (I also keep the bedroom and storage room doors closed reducing this area to closer to 450 sq ft. I account for the difference in RH within the room compared to the digital hygrometer built into the unit by increasing its set up by 10%.I was also unaware of the need to replace hygiene discs in this unit at a cost of -$50 every 3 months. This cost more than the HEPA filters from Dyson.Overall, the product seems to humidify in the dry Denver climate, but I am not sure it is worth the cost. I debate whether using two LW45 units would have been better (cheaper upfront cost) with no need to purchase expensive hygiene discs\u2026"

This time it was returned in a pretty well packed single box. The only minor problem was when it arrived UPS, I watched him carry it up and drop the box straight down maybe a foot high. When I tried to spin the water wheels with my finger, they were jammed. I pulled them out and gently replaced them and all is well. The cleaning is superb as expected, and everything works properly plugged in and turned on. Thanks for the service."

I reached out to Venta (you send email because they don't answer the phone) and they say I need two units. I have no space for another unit considering the product is sizable and you must place it a considerable distance from the wall and furnitures. Venta also said to run it continuously at high speed for 7-10 days. For me that's impossible because with loft living, every time I cook the windows and doors must be open so the humidity goes out immediately. What I like about the product: 1) it's quiet at a fan speed of 2 so I can sleep with it on; but the display light is bright so I put a paper on top 2) No need to buy wicks (but you have to buy a water treatment additive 3) The product seems to be solidly made although I have had some issues assembling the unit after taking it apart for water refills. Got E1 and sometimes it says there's not enough water after I have refilled it. Figured it out eventually but prefer to not be having these issues at all. 4) You can use tap water although I use soft water from the bathroom out of overabundance of caution. 5) No white dust is produced as in the case of ultrasonic humidifiers. All in all I will return the unit and get a whole house professional humidifier that is mounted by the furnace (out of sight) and can humidity my large space."

          "Contenu": "As a long time Venta Airwasher owner, I was happy to get a second Venta when I moved from a one bedroom apartment to a two story townhome.  The LW 45 Comfort Plus is a nice size, just about an inch or 2 bigger on all sides than my original LW 45, but covering more sq ft.  Easy to clean and maintain is probably the main reason I got it.  Doubling as an air purifier was the reason for getting the original one.  Although I am not sure of the degree to which it is actually purifying the air.  My reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is that the Comfort Plus model has an obnoxiously bright LED display which would make it impossible to ever use in a bedroom.  If you hit the sleep button, the light will dim some, but the fan also slows to low.  This feature does not allot for customers who may want to keep their Venta on high when they sleep and have no LED light in their bedroom.  Other than that, the new model does have a nice auto feature and a nice auto shut off feature whereby the unit shuts off when it runs out of water.  There's also a nice indicator light which tells you when you need to clean it.  All these features are nice, but for bedroom use, there really should be a display button that you can hit to turn off the display light while you sleep.  Dimming is not enough.  One should be able to turn the light off completely.  Also, the original Venta came with a 10 year warranty.  New Ventas only come with a 2 years warranty.  Why?  Does Venta no longer believe in its product?  I still think Venta is the best, and that's why when it came time to purchase a second humidifier, I went with Venta.  I just wish they would change the display and the warranty."

          "Contenu": "I bought my first Venta airwashers over 20 years ago, and they have been the hardest working and most dependable appliances in my home! They finally gave up the ghost within 6 months of each other, but I\u2019d say almost 21 years of faithful service made them a fantastic investment. The reason I didn\u2019t give 5 stars to their new \u201ccousins\u201d are: the power cord used to be surrounded by thick rubber-coated material which was virtually indestructible. The new airwashers have a very thin, skimpy electrical cord which I can\u2019t see lasting very long. The plastic housing of the airwashers also seems thinner and less robust. The pluses: there is now an automatic turn off switch when the water level gets too low-the older style would just keep running even when completely dry. Also, the lighter-weight housing is easier to carry when it\u2019s full of water. I\u2019m hoping that these new airwashers will give me many years of service."

Your \"chat\" guys told me the little drive wheels needed cleaning. Not so--the bearings (?) wore out. Call me if you would like to hear the noise.       About 5 years ago I was informed that for LW-44 motors my warranty was 5 years. In fact one began to show metal chips in the bottom of the tank recently. I bought a new motor from you at about $120.00 and found I did not get the drive wheel with it. So another $25.00 spent. Sadly, in perusing your website I noticed that my motor had a 10 YEAR warranty and now my unit just missed the cutoff. I have the two remaining and they are progressively getting worse. I will replace them as I really like the units since they keep my house in good humidity control during the Winter months. Seems to me someone did not give me the facts and I could have had my motors replaced under warranty. Wish it were so. Total cost of $435.00 to get all my units running is a bit dicey for this 86 year old retiree. Will probably not make 10 more so you will not have to replace the current ones.  Thanks & stay in business till then --I might need you.    R Gross  989-350-8891 Telly"

I am so glad I came across the VENTA, It ran over 3 days before I put more water in it (the light didn't come on, I simply did it for convenience).  I love how quiet it is on the \"Sleep\" mode; I love how you can set the \"humidity percentage\"; and the overall simplicity of use.  I can fill it, set it and let it go.  I have severe dry eye and I need a humidifier I can count on.  In fact, I will likely order another one within the next 2-3 months for our family room.  I HIGHLY recommend this product!"

          "Titre": "Venta Humidifiers Are Outstanding!",
          "Contenu": "We recently purchased two Venta Comfort Plus room humidifiers: the LW25 and the LW45. They are a world of difference away from our old humidifiers. We've tried evaporative and ultrasonic in the past, and while both types worked to humidify well, they came with a lot of additional work: constant decalcifying for the evaporative humidifiers, while the ultrasonics left a sticky fine dust everywhere in the house. Both styles were noisy and required a lot of additional cleaning over the season as well.The Venta Comfort Plus technology is simple, efficient, and very quiet. Except when running at its highest mode, the Venta humidifiers are nearly silent. They are incredibly easy to care for, and if one regularly uses the Venta Water Treatment Additive, the humidifiers only need a quick rinse and refresh every two weeks. My only work now is filling the tanks every morning so the humidifiers can keep us comfortable throughout the day. I highly recommend Venta; they are worth the extra cost in terms of quality of workmanship, performance, and ease of use!"

There is an additive and a cleaning agent to buy but I appreciate that these items keep the day-to-day cleaning requirements of the machine to a bare minimum compared to the ultrasonic humidifiers I've had in the past that sorely missed the mark in many ways. After purchasing one Venta last winter and seeing it in action, I decided it was worth getting two more this winter to cover two bedrooms and the main living area."
