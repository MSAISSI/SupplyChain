I will definitely not use anymore Vagaro because it\u2019s not a platform that controls the status of the businesses on their platform as well as doesn\u2019t help its customers to get the money back for scam like the one that happened to me."

They charge $40 a month (you read that right) to run and automated transfer to your Quickbooks software. Their customer service is often snarky and unhelpful, sometimes just not responding to email inquiries at all. Their payment processing platform is unorganized and antiquated. Don't make the mistake I did, go with Acuity or Square appointments instead."

They also make it impossible to transfer your client info out of the platform so it\u2019s incredibly difficult to transfer to a new platform.

          "Contenu": "I am in the process of finding a hair salon software for my business.I signed up for a free trial with Vagaro using my personal email address so I can try it out before considering it as an option. When I thought \"huh, I can consider it an option, but I need to talk to a sales person to ask more questions\", I booked a Demo call, using my business' email address. I talked to a guy named Gerardo. At the end of the call, he asked me if I wanted to do a trial, and I said that I had started one but hadn't gotten a chance to use it. This is when things got weird and negative... Gerardo said that he needed to talk to support to figure out how to move forward, as I already had a trial on my personal email account. Then he reached back to me and said that I had to sign up for a new trial using the link he will send me (with his name on it). I was going to do that, but I needed to first make sure to cancel the trial I had started on my personal email address. Turns out that when Gerardo talked to support, they blocked my login privileges to the account I had started a trial on, as I couldn't login or reset my password. I thought \"Maybe Gerardo closed that account for me\", so I went ahead and sent Gerardo 2 follow up emails to confirm that my previous account was closed and the trial was effectively cancelled. He never replied.. Completely ghosted. For no reason. Maybe he left the company? Maybe he was fired? No idea... But then, to my surprise, I was charged one month of membership last Friday. How infuriating, not only I had already spent my time trying to login to this account multiple times and following up twice with Gerardo, but I had to now deal with them to refund the charges... So, after spending more of my time on calls and emails, they said that they won't refund anything. I don't even care about the $90 at this point, I just care about the morality of the entire situation. How in the world would I actually consider their software if this is how they treat potential customers?I could never recommend Vagaro :("

I am still rating them 3 stars due to their customer service not being positive and solution based from the start. Original: STAY FAR AWAY!!!!!!  This is a company with ZERO morals or humanity.  We run a non-profit organization that provides mental healthcare to homeless youth.  We had a free trial for 30 days- because of how difficult it is to navigate their site- i was 1 day late to cancel the free trial.  Because of this, I was charged the monthly rate.  When I contacted support and told them we will absolutely NOT being using their software, they told me they cannot refund the charge.  So basically they are charging me for a whole month that im not using- and even worse charging a community service based organization for something that we will not use.A total money hungry company with no ethics!They have a one size fits all and horrible customer service.. STAY AWAY!!! they dont care about people"
