When I asked if it was due to my sexual orientation, they just avoided the question. They didn't even answer \"No, not because of that\". It is unacceptable to encounter discrimination of any form and I cannot recommend using this service as it appears to have questionable practices. People should be careful where they spend their money. It's a shame I can't attach screenshots of this conversation...Avoid!"

After paying more than 150$ to clean my clients data base, I sent an email campaign to the active emails.Many of them had a hard bounce, making my campaign totally disastrous. All the emails ended up in the spam folders and my domain is now considered spam.I contacted Zero Bounce to ask why did their service told me that those emails were good when they weren't and they answered that they knew about it, but that is not so important. Now they blocked my account and I cannot even use the remaining credits I had. I feel scammed and very disappointed."

So, I used Zerobounce to clean up a list. The website is simple, without bells and whistles, and more designed for IT and data professionals than general consumers like me. The service did a good job of identifying the various categories of files (valid, spamtrap, catchall, etc.). It also provides a good PDF report that summarizes the results. However, it does not provide a description or definition of these category names. They assume that their users will know what they are, which is not necessarily the case. I contacted customer service and they seemed to be as clueless insisting that the definitions were on the summary report, which they are not, only the description names are listed with no indication as to what they mean and how they can affect your list. The services does what it's supposed to do, but the customer care part of the site could use some improvements. Zerobounce is best for developers. Next time I will probably use Neverbounce, a bit more expensive, but their website is very user friendly."

After the review went up they spent a great deal of effort to make things right with me and with the general public.  First, they refunded my fee.  Next, they gave me credits for future usage.  Finally, they updated their website to address my concerns.  With rapid and effective customer service like this I can't in good faith keep my former negative review posted.  And considering the fact that I was prepared to give them 5 stars in the first place, I'll go ahead and give it to them now.  Their responsiveness to my concerns was impressive."
