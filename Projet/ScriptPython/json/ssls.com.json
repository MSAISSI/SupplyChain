Everything is intentionally cryptic so that you have to hire them to install the certificates.  After 9 days of messing with them and offering money if they would just get it done.  I signed up for Bluehost paid almost same price it was completed in 2 hours, You get exactly what you pay for.  I would rather just sell things door to door then ever deal with this company again.  They just do not even get the idea of customer service...It is probably intentional I don't know but I paid twice for an SSL certificate."

That is how we started this journey - uploading the directory/file as requested. Validation DID NOT work.Now in response to a complaint more incorrect information is given out. And no I will not provide my phone number etc as I have wasted too much time on this already."

This company may use money earned from Russian customers to help people in UA. But instead they have chosen to way of discrimination. They wrote that my guilt is that I have to pay taxes to Russian government. Well, a lot of western companies do the same; they pay taxes to Russian government. Apple, just for instance. But they are not Russians and that's alright. They wrote that my guilt is that I have to pay taxes to Russian government. Well, after this company stopped providing their service to me, do they really believe that I stop pay taxes. Sounds strange.PS After the answer of the vendor (see below) it is clear that they just banned _all_ Russians because as they write \"we made a mistake by overlooking those free media organizations... We hope you can understand that we were acting quickly\".The vendor acted quickly and just banned all Russians no matter if they are against the war or not. Only because such a customer is Russian.The vendor confirmed that they are rasists acting quickly to discriminate people just because of their ethnicity.They stupidly believe that a banned customer will \"fight against this tyranny\". Lol, what?! Such a customer will of course just start using another service and that's all.In the answer below you will not find anything about western companies that continue working on Russian market and that continue paying taxes. Do you really think SSLs.com ban them? Absolutely, no. Why? It is clear. They are western companies, they are not Russians - that is why.EU buys Russian gas and Russian oil. They pay to the Russian government. Do you think SSLs.com is going to ban such buyers. Of course, not!Distilled racism."

TLS which superseded SSL in 1999 - so 22 years of cryptographic advancements \"doesn't make much of a difference\" - that's not only unprofessional, it's dangerous advice and that's why I will never use SSLs again.Also I don't really see the point in paying $100 for something that has an easily superior free certificate via lets encrypt. I was originally persuaded by their \"Get exactly the same products for better prices\" table on their homepage which conspicuously completely neglected to mention Lets Encrypt - a CA which issues around 2,000,000 certificates daily didn't make the comparison table. So that's the second reason I'll never use SSLs again. Dangerous advice and deceptive advertising."

Their payment processor was being a pain for whatever reason and for that reason, my money got debited from my bitcoin wallet, but the order was never marked as completed. I opened a ticket at their support - #VHR-714-40320 and they told me that my transaction was missing confirmations. The transaction was confirmed over a day or so ago at that point and they still refused to manually review my payment or give me the bitcoin transaction hash so that I could monitor the transaction on my end too. When asked for bitcoin hash, I was provided \"The transaction ID in question is 5NwcP2D5YZrrvUoe2U9KQz. \" as response. To this date, my order has not been completed and I still have not received my SSL certificate. Overall, I definitely would NOT recommend this website for your SSL certificate needs. Mind you, this was my second order with this website, and well, I am disappointed to waste 60 bucks over nothing.PS: And my ticket has been marked as resolved and their support staff is not helpful at all and do not understand my concern.------------------------------------------------------It took some time but thank you, this issue was resolved, apologies for not updating the feedback on time. I was refunded back to my wallet. I am unhappy with the experience and the fact that I had to use trustpilot to have this issue resolved but whatever."

However, I'm glad I persevered, as it was just a problem with the validation process. It took a few emails back and forth between my webmaster and SSls.com before we finally got it sorted out, but it was worth the little bit of extra work to get SSL certs at such an amazing price. SSLs.com customer service team were really quick to respond to my emails and sort it out as well. If you're willing to put in the work, I would highly recommend."

I may have had second thoughts if I'd have had to pay for 5 years upfront with an untested cert.Anyway - long story short, the new Cert was installed in under 10 mins from receiving the download and now I don't have to worry about anything for a whole 12 months - pure bliss for under $4/year.
