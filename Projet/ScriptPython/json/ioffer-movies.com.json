All up this cost me 80 dollars which i spent almost more on the shipping! Communication was really bad, no one actually responded to my question about getting a refund on the shipping costs. I definitely won't be buying off this company again. Really really angry.Just hope my package arrives soon as it's for a birthday present which now has to be a very late present."

Have emailed etc many times absolutely no response, I thought the company had stopped trading but I see the website is up and running and their are recent reviews so obviously it's just me. What a disgraceful way to treat a loyal customer, one who has spent hundreds if not over a thousand dollars/pounds on this company. Very upset."

After a month of hearing nothing, I asked Ioffer to look into where my parcel had gone: I heard nothing. I emailed again a week later: still I heard nothing. Not only have I not received my purchase, I have had no apology, nor has anyone made any effort to contact me. Maybe if this awful review is read, it might prompt some action. I just want my purchase or my money back. I can't advise possible customers, but I shall certainly not be dealing with Ioffer ever again."

The only issues were, the English subtitles were a literal translation from the Belgian Dutch, and therefore some lines didn't quite make sense and there were 3 episodes missing from the final series. However, I immediately contacted them and received them the next day. I will probably use them again if no other source is available."

Seasons 4-7 had a lower quality (720p) since they were copied from mainly the Chicago TV station of WGN. But that was the only way to get a copy of these seasons.The price of $71 was excellent. Buying DVD\u2019s for only the first three seasons would have cost way more.Only one episode had bad skips, even after I tried to clean it. So, it was basically unwatchable. But given that there were 13 episodes per season and 7 seasons, one bad  episode recording out of 91 is pretty good.So, overall, I\u2019d recommend iOffer."

I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s more economical for vendor to replace any broken DVDs rather than pack the dvd in individual holders. Maybe DVDs are very solid and don\u2019t crack, I\u2019m wary of postal people dropping a heavy box on it and crack it.  Anyway they were received fine and I think four DVDs stacked one on top of another forms a solid mass. I like the way it\u2019s recoded, three episodes per disk and easy to use.  I will definitely order more from this vendor in future.  It would have been five stars but I\u2019m a tad wary of the packaging, putting it in a stronger envelop or small box would give me more confidence.  No breakage though.  (Perhaps shipping just one dvd may have a different packaging.)  Anyway DVDs themselves - 5 Stars."

The movie selection is just so great; so many wonderful titles I\u2019ve found here. The picture/recording quality is mainly good ( not HD of course ). I\u2019ve purchased about 20 and was not pleased with two maybe three of them ( with two of them It was not a big deal ). With many titles It\u2019s both such a pleasure of finding/watching them On DVD, such good films, and the nice clarity and colour tone of the picture. For Some of the 1960-80:s movies the old colour tones, and with some a certain graininess ( for example with the Canadian movie Sonatine from 1984 ) is just a pure pleasure watching.Skickat fr\u00e5n min iPad"
