Report says failed due to manufacturing defects, when I contacted customer service they said I could have damaged them.Excuse me but if they have failed due to manufacturing defects you should be refunding me! Now gone to bank to raise case.Having used StockX several times previously I\u2019m appalled by the service and this is borderline fraud!As for your reply, I have liaised with your customer contact department, I asked for the photographs you would have taken from my purchase\u2026funnily enough they were not available\u2026suspect!!!"

I chatted with stockx explaining that shipping now needed to be expedited and I was willing to pay extra at this point in time. I was told I had that option when I ordered them and that's the only time I could choose it even though stockx was the on that canceled the order. No one was helpful at all and then 5 days later order was canceled again and I was promised a refund in 7 to 10 days wow. So I put up even more money and ordered the same boots for the same seller paying for express shipping and wow 2 days later they arrived. So if you want items from this site select the most expensive way to purchase that item or you will be screwed with and cheated till you finally repurchase the item at the higher price."

So now I sit $180.00 out of pocket and no order and no resolution in sight. It was not delivered anywhere near my house. The city it was \"delivered\" to is not even near where I live.

And they don't do returns or refunds. They say they have a guarantee if your purchase isn't authentic. But if they \"verified\" it before they sent it to me, how exactly does that work?!

I spoke with a customer service over text chat and he told me it was not delayed and in fact the delivery was lost in transit to stockx and the only way to fix it was to get a refund. I respectfully expressed my wish to place a new order for the shoes with expedited shipping after the new pair reached their HQ to which he declined and then shortly after i had an issue finding my apple id email in the format he needed for refund he ended the chat. I still haven't received a refund or the shoes and was basically told they wont be coming at all and since i dont have the apple id email in the format requested i wont get a refund. To make matters worse i was emailed a 15% off discount code that expires in 90 days as if id ever purchase from this site again. If anyone is reading this do not order here. When the seller fails to send the item they in turn will lie and tell you its delayed, they refuse to give any customer service number for those that aren't tech savvy, and have zero customer loyalty. My shoes were lost in transit and my money was kept. This site is big trash"

I would not recommend this app to anyone because you cant talk to a real person & their customer service took more than 48 hours to get back to my complaint( via email ) . Of course by then , guess what the shoes  were already shipped to me . This is a useless site and their shipping is way too pricy. Never again ! App deleted"

Someone\u2019s \u00a32,500 hand bag delivered instead (no tags attached so despite on here multiple comments that they have vigorous verification processes that hadn\u2019t happened) contacted stockx straight away.  Bag delivered back I\u2019ve had 3 weeks of back and forward emails, multiple requests of confirmation that the bag was sent back.  Emails to me saying they have it but was waiting for verification (to be clear they had no idea what bag it was and that they ever sent it).  Then more emails as it was clear they had then lost the bag and were waiting for me to return the watch I never received.  They\u2019ve requested my drivers licence details to open an investigation.  In the end I started a credit card claim against them and my bank advised no personal information be sent.  Finally today I received my refund it\u2019s taken 4 weeks of constant emails.I\u2019ve had along the way refund will be processed immediately after bag received back then 1-5 days, 3-5 days and 5-8 days.  No department knows what the other is doing.  My watch and this bag have clearly been lost along the way (to be clear the watch was no where near \u00a32,500) so the suggestion I was somehow making up receiving it is just ludicrous.  I\u2019ve been offered $40 goodwill gesture to re order the watch no thanks watch ordered via eBay and received 2 days later and is genuine with receipt etc.Would I ever use stockx again absolutely not would I recommend sellers using stockx absolutely not given I received someone\u2019s bag they had sent in for verification.  Their verification team are non existent and I think their customer care team is just as bad."

Ghada was very helpful in progressing my order so I decided not to cancel. StockX states a further 1-2 days for verification/authentication once the item has arrived to them- it has now been with them for 5 coming up 6 days and the order still hasn\u2019t progressed. I sent another email asking for updates, Mohamed gave a very generic reply restating 1-2 days for verification therefore completely missing my point. I have since been sent an update simply saying that my order is delayed and will be sent in 1-2 weeks, which is totally useless to me and disappointing. StockX have failed to give updates willingly and have also failed to give adequate information when prompted. Avoid using if you want your item in a timely manner. It will be approaching a month by the time the item is even potentially shipped.Not to mention the inflated price I bought the item at on the original date which had reduced by \u00a350 by the time the seller actually shipped the item 5 days later- no offer for partial refund to reflect current stock prices!!In response to StockX reply below- again you\u2019re missing the point. My issue now lies solely with StockX who for some reason still have the item for verification/authentication after 6 days and show no sign of shipping it to me any time soon. What is the delay now please??"

Ordering was easy and simple, I like how they have a layout of when the order is placed, then recieved, then shipped etc.. Each step lights up when it gets to that step. That's all cool until my order was delayed for maybe a day or two since the original seller wasn't available anymore and now a new one needed to accommodate my order. Not a big deal, the whole purpose of this review is the fact these pairs of 11 platinum tints has a serious cosmetic issue, at least in my eyes, when it comes to the glue that is holding the shoe and white sole together, on one of the shoes it literally looks like It was put together by someone unprofessionally and given to me.. This will be the first and only review I ever write and make for you guys Stockx, not only because I don't even write reviews like that, but also because I will NEVER shop at stockx again, due to the fact you guys CANNOT be trusted, at least with my money, anymore since I am terrified of ever receiving another pair from you guys. Imagine how I feel having these pairs with this issue, wanting to now try to trade or swap the pair with a normal looking pair so I can feel comfortable wearing these. I have a video and photos to prove it. I'm also writing this for other buyers like myself that gets excited to buy a pair of awesome sneakers only to recieve a pair with a ugly cosmetic issue, when it's suppose to be factory brand new. I will now buy all my sneakers at goat from now on until they also give me a reason to stop shopping there. I just bought some 13s and the 11 gratitudes from goat so let's see how they turn out."

First, StockX as a sneaker exchange was the best marketplace I was able to find for a limited edition pair of sneakers that I was willing to overpay for due to scarcity. The pluses are they are big on product authentication and the personal touch of their customer support is solid. Unfortunately their customer service policies are a disaster. My package arrived damaged and the administrative burden associated with transacting a remedy were more challenging than applying for a credit card, paying court costs, or just about any other social transaction. #1 I am not a sneaker dealer, just an end user. StockX does not need a driver's license to issue a refund for shipping. No other entity does this and I repeat that I was not looking to return the entire shipment. My ability to resell the product is already compromised. Just comp me the shipping and call it a day. #2 They make you fill out a waiver as a PDF. Nobody wants to deal with PDFs unless you are dealing with a government agency and have no choice in the matter. #3 This company does business from a Michigan address. If the State of Michigan or Wayne County is indirectly imposing this administrative burden on customers then  I recommend StockX move to Wisconsin which is way nicer for mail order businesses. Thank you. I will go back to eBay."

It's been WELL over a week and I still have not received the third pair.  I'm not even certain when they will get it in stock and ship it.BTW, my wife tells me that they don't take returns.  If the shoes have obviously NOT been taken out of the box,  I think that's a bit unreasonable.  I accidentally ordered two pairs of the same shoes and now must sell one on ebay or something else.   If my wife's information is true, deduct one star.  If it's not true, then the two star review applies.  I will probably not be ordering from them again.  I did this time because that's what I was instructed to do by my wife and she knows more about this than I do...or was supposed to. So I guess I'd say if you're in a hurry to get 3 day delivery, explore options.  If you're not absolutely sure of what you want, order from someone who takes returns.  BUT, it's my understanding that they have possibly the best stock available."

The shoes promise to ship to the verification within a few days minus holidays and weekends, which took mine about a week and a half to even get verified and shipped\u2026 When I noticed it was coming from Hong Kong I was a little discouraged because I had never used this company before.  There are no phone numbers to talk to anyone. you have to wait till somebody send you an email to address your questions.  When I finally received the shoes, I inspected them, and was concerned because it looked like they had been worn, and that somebody tried to clean up the soles, but missed a few spots.  I\u2019m upset because it said new never worn  and paid over $168 for the shoes and it is clear that they\u2019ve been worn and cleaned.  If whoever was verifying, went over these shoes, a little slower, I believe they would\u2019ve noticed that this has been worn or, they could advertise \u201cshoe is new with minor imperfections from handling and trying on\u201d I just feel all around that I was misled and I took a big leap of faith and spending this money on a pair of shoes that my son wants.  I am not satisfied with how this went down and I\u2019m hoping to get some sort of refund\u2026 but as I waited so long to receive these shoes by the time that they could be replaced it\u2019s going to be past Christmas\u2026 so definitely upset."

I listened to past customers about the wait time problem and I thought y'all would've corrected it by now. Guess not. Glad my item is Authentic, that's why the 3stars.

I am new to this process and am disappointed to learn that a seller can immediately receive payment from me but then be unable to fulfill the order.  I waited days (Bid accepted on Nov 30 and I made contact on Dec 6) for an update that the item was shipped only to find out the seller could not fulfill the order after I asked.  I have a refund in process and appreciate the staff of StockX.  But, I hope the seller has some ramification for posting, accepting, and then being unable to complete the transaction.  I can't back out after they accept the bid.  Seems shady that they can."

Laces were not tidy, an insole on one of the shoes wasn't in straight, the box paper was ripped and the authentication tag was loose in the box.
