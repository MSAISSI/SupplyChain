Amongst many reasons why I am a HoboHost customer for life now is the personal attention to detail. They will migrate your website FOR YOU as long as you share your credentials, which you can easily change the password to later for security sake. They have one employee in particular, \"CHAD\" who spoke with me on the phone and returned my voicemail after hours in like 5 minutes. He answered ALL my questions, clearly, and made sure I understand how to proceed  BEFORE I  SPENT A DIME. Mind....Blown! Then, after registering and sending in the needed credentials and a brief overview of what I needed done, it was CHAD himself who stood and delivered. No more bouncing around from one hosting provider to another. HERE TO STAY! Thank you HoboHost for running such a tight ship and employing people like CHAD! Peace be with you, from a happy retired Firefighter :)"
