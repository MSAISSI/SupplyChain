          "Titre": "Terrible CS with a \"not our problem\" mentality toward shared host users.",
          "Contenu": "The CS is terrible here. Whenever we have issues the responses are very vague and generally illude to \"it's a problem on your end\", with no explanation or information. To get insight on issues, I generally have to respond multiple times. One of those times I was told we could \"upgrade to a managed server\" for nearly $300/mo. I don't need to pay triple for a managed server when a private server would allow me to access the necessary information to figure out my own problems. The issue is the complete lack of information available and CS treating you like you don't deserve help if you don't pay a premium.It took multiple complaints and months of having issues with the shared Windows host bogging down to find out that we are allotted a whopping 256mb ram. Okay... fine, I can be more efficient with my code. But seriously...256mb?Their \"unlimited\" storage is limited to 15gb at first, and each time you make a request you get a whopping 5gb more--which, when you are storing PDF's is entirely insufficient. Also... I am sitting on 31 TB on my personal computer... is it really necessary to restrict shared hosting to 15gb in this age. Are we hosting on 2005 computers still?This last time around I had an unexpected change in workflow that caused a burst of about 570 emails every 15 minutes--during the holiday when I wasn't around to notice. I received an automated ticket during thanksgiving stating that abuse would be met with account suspension and \"WinHost is not intended for mass emailing\". No consideration for the fact that all the emails were duplicates and going to the same address. When I got back from the holiday, the email account was inaccessible, yet I have been repeatedly told nothing was changed. Well the two of us with access obviously didn't change the password over the holiday. It took a couple responses to get pointed to an article on how to change your password, which was at least something. But the ticket has been repeatedly closed without answers as to why I can't login in the first place when \"nothing was changed\".I wasn't the one who chose this host... but I am the one who has initiated leaving them."

The SCD method creates HUGE deployment artifacts, which take 30-60 seconds to load, even on a Premium account footprint.  My customers don't accept that lack of response time.  I am deploying my next application site to Azure.  The cost may be more, but the enhanced response time and ability to publish in FDD mode is worth the change in scenery and the increased cost."

They allow up to 4,000 outgoing emails a day if you throttle the sending, which is awesome. But, I didn't need quite that much. At the start, I needed to send out 110 emails via SMTP server on a Wordpress site one day. After 25 emails sent, nothing else was sent out. Turns out, I was flagged as SPAM by their email filter. After three attempts and a full week of fixing things, it never really was fixed. I chose to stay with GoDaddy (ugh) and use a third party email company.

          "Contenu": "This is a first review after about half a year of use of winhost's asp.net core windows hosting.Overall: very happy with the hosting, albeit that some features that are standard included in other shared hosting providers are missing.Pros:+ Very stable, haven't had a single outage. (Unlike Accuwebhosting that non-stop crash their servers).+ Support is responsive and competent. You're not first getting some call center in a low wage country that first gives you nonsense replies 3 times where you have to keep explaining yourself over and over before getting escalated to real engineers (Accuwebhosting does this)+ The amount of memory and disk space is generous on their Max plan ($9.95 per month).+ Pricing quite competitive, Max plan is quite good.There are some downsides, no deal breakers, but still some inconveniences/annoyances:- The control panel is ancient and missing quite a number of things that is standard in modern control panels like Plesk. They are some ancient set of aspx pages. Overall winhost seems reluctant to invest in a more full featured control panel or just using Plesk, which is a shame, because this would easily land them in the 5 stars rating. I don't understand the reluctance to change, I've seen multiple people asking for features mentioned in this list, and they're all being shot down.- No online file manager. If you need to move large directory trees around on the server, that kind of thing is painful/impossible. I've had to create a primitive file manager myself to do this. File manager is standard in other control panels.- No automated support for letsencrypt certificates. You can however do this manually using certbot.

I opted to pay the same and increase the amount of databases, bandwidth, storage space, etc. WinHost was easy to switch to. However, there is no phone support, which bothered me a little but once I started, it was so easy, I did not require any support. The few questions I had afterwards, I sent emails and they were responded to promptly. One shortcoming is the amount of tools at your disposal. There is no FTP tool or database management tool. To work with my databases, I need to have my own SQL management and my own FTP software. Small by comparison to what I am getting in return. WinHost may be small now but I think this was an excellent move for my business and I look forward to see what is coming in the near future."

First, I'm happier with WinHost than I am with DigitalOcean because WinHost provides IIS hosting. I'm more knowledgeable in Windows Systems Engineering than I am in Linux, so I find it easier to spin up websites using IIS. \r Also, I believe this survey / review came to me because of my recent experience with Tech Support. It was very positive. Good response time and no ambiguity when it came to resolving the issue. I had a PHP error and they fixed it. That is how support should be. I don't do many complex things when spinning up websites, so I think that the few issues I may run into should be easily resolvable. \r I have also already had to use the backup service at least twice now (my error, not WinHost's) and it was flawless. Restore a full site with no issues. \r So far, I am very happy with the service provided by WinHost, but I am not so anxious to jump in and give them a 5 star just yet. I am going to continue to evaluate the full extent of their services and see how well it goes.\r Thank you"

The sites don't get much traffic but they are a hobby for me and I wanted to get them running again...\r I found Winhost by searching for \"Classic ASP hosting\".  They support the Persits suite of tools which is critical for me.  Transferring my first site and database over was pretty painless.  I will work on the other site in the near future. \r Their support is very quick to reply to email but there is no chat or phone option.  I find their control panel to be utilitarian if not overly friendly.  I believe they wrote their own control panel rather than use something like Plesk.  So far, it has done just about everything I needed it to do although it just doesn't feel \"friendly\".  If I was new to web hosting, I probably would feel lost but I have done this dance several times and I know what to look for...  \r One potential gotcha: They do not include daily site backups as part of their plans.  You have to pay a few dollars for it monthly.  This is the first time I have seen a webhost charge for backups.  By this point, I think most us take that for granted."

          "Contenu": "First, I have to say that I had to move my website from Arvixe, which has a very poor organization that exhibits almost non-existent support\u2014Beware all potential users! They took my money over my protests (outside their warranty period) when my website's server was down for over six weeks! They did not respond to my many service \u2018tickets\u2019 to move my website to a working server. Their Chat service goes through the Phillipines, with folks who cannot possibly help with obviously poor management and their equipment issues, and I had no choice after two weeks of this but to then switch ISPs immediately.Now, my early experience with WinHost is far and above that of Arvixe, in how WinHost provided content and their responses to my questions. The reason I did not award five stars is that this organization is still relying on the expertise of people. What I mean by this is I'm looking for systems (in the dry, barren desert wasteland of internet services) that employ an automated \"expert system\" in response to technical or other service questions. For example, I recently sent a bit of code I used in my website's email routine and asked for WinHost\u2019s help.The initial response during a Chat was inadequate! Now, I can certainly 'feel' for the folks manning their posts\u2014possibly youngish, with maybe little skills in the way of investigative and failure-analysis training or techniques. But, less than an hour later, I got an email with an example ASP script to use and with only two minor tweaks to my existing code, I was immediately back in business! In a communication about three weeks earlier on a less-technical question, I was 'serviced' by someone who was having a bad day. This was evidenced by their terse responses and non-answers to some of my questions during the Chat session.Again, it's difficult to respond on a daily basis to problems that other people are having, through tough communication channels such as Chat or email, and I certainly sympathize with this daily \u2018grind\u2019. Many people have trouble communicating their problem and may not even know why they are seeing the results they are. They may be inarticulate, whether through writing in Chat or an email request, or when speaking with someone. A better method is a machine that asks a few questions and either sends the data / information they may be looking for, then \u2018intelligently\u2019 waits for a reply as to whether the issue was resolved. If the machine can\u2019t answer their question, the individual is informed that a person will be in touch shortly. Much better, in my opinion!"

When we were ready to host our website, we reached out to Winhost and started the setup process immediately. The process was very simple and the support was excellent. Whenever we needed help, in most cases Winhost already had a well documented and easy to follow instruction on how to set the environment up. We also like the control panel, which is an in-house application and is far more user friendly than the standard control panels such as Plesk. We would definitively recommend Winhost to anyone looking for a Windows server hosting company."

We had been with GoDaddy and suffered with slow servers and the absolute WORST customer service.  I reached out to WinHost and within hours their team had helped us migrate all our domains, in house sites and clients to their platform.  Since then, in some 20 years, our down time can be measured in minutes, if not seconds.  The reliability has just been phenomenal.  When I have had questions I've been able to reach out to their skilled support team and gotten solid professional answers in less than ten minutes.  I love the open hosting setup they offer where they pretty much allow us to customize our needs exactly as we want.  They are constantly updating to the latest software and hardware to ensure all our sites perform at peak optimization. In short, WinHost does hosting right.  If you need a reliable, economically priced web host that has your back 24/7, then WinHost is where you need to be.  I could not recommend them more."

The value for money is great - something I appreciate very much as a small business owner.No hosting company is perfect, but what matters is how they tackle problems when they come up. I've faced some outages (not uncommon over a course of a decade), DDoS attacks on my sites, and sometimes even my own mistakes which caused problems on the site. Through all of these, WinHost's customer service team always helped me through. I can't recall any support request that took longer than a few hours to resolve.It is also worth noting how quickly they identified a DDoS threat on our site, efficiently shut it down, and then helped us identify where the weakness was. It helped us fix the security gap quickly and get things back online for our customers.Bottom line: in a sea full of hosting companies where it is difficult to know who to trust, I have placed mine in WinHost and I encourage you to give them a try."

I had previously been with GoDaddy for about 20 years, and having reached my frustration limit, cautiously began researching other options. Even as a \"pre-customer\" I found the WinHost service response time to be excellent. I have been live with WinHost for about three days now, since completion of the domain transfer. The tools and customer support from WinHost made the transfer a very simple matter, and my setup is rather complex. Since moving to WinHost I have noted three specific areas of dramatic improvement.1. Page Load times have decreased dramatically from about 8-10 seconds to about 1 or 2.2. Email is FAR easier to use - a dramatic improvement.3. WinHost customer support is very quick. Clearly they make this a priority, and I love it. I have found that response time is typically 1 to 2 hours. Beyond the customer support team, there is an excellent online forum with a lot of activity.  I have also found answers to some of my questions there.I have no concerns whatsoever about recommending WinHost as a web hosting platform.Damon J. GrayLynden, WA"
