Plus, the service isn't great\u2014keeps losing connection, and you have to reconnect all the time. In the realm of online services, it's reasonable to expect a refund option, especially when the service has not been utilized at all. Overall, not happy with the service, and it makes you question the company's fairness."

          "Contenu": "Subscribed for 1 month with Surfshark, as a trial, and found it wouldn't let me access certain apps or sites, which meant to gain access I had to pause connection. Downloaded it onto my Iphone hoping that would change, and it was even worse. I couldn't connect to my home Wifi, not receive/send any calls/emails etc.As the service was not fit for purpose, I emailed them yesterday to cancel my subscription. As I have no intentions of using it further, I asked if I could get my refund as per their policy. An agent by the name of Kit then said i couldn't get a refund because i had taken a previous subscription within the last 6 months. I replied and said this subscription was the only one I had ever taken out with them. I then asked for proof, only to receive an email today saying they couldn't confirm the card ending that was apparently used to take out a subscription in August. I am annoyed as the potential risk of fraud being carried out on my account (no transaction found), so now im beginning be believe this is an excuse not to refund my money - making them a scammy company with low ethics. I really hope someone in that company does the right thing.."

Id like to cancel my describtion, because I dont need surfshark anymore, but I could not cancel even I just subcribed for 2 years just a month ago, surfshark support still denied to give me back my money, so I  had to keep surfshark. But coming to the real facts about the technical aspect, I swear, I turned off my vpn because soo many websites detected surfshark vpn and denied me access. After my 2 years experience with surfshark I can say, im very dissapointed of the service and technical aspect of the vpns, so many of them are already on a blacklist on different servers, the other are easy detectable. I will never come back to surfshark again."

It literally don't last 1 day my ipad, with the other VPN my battery has never been affected. Customer care didn't even care to find a solution or inspect this further. I would not suggest to anyone this VPN."

They keep pushing off my request and asking me to try using the product more. I don\u2019t know why this company has good reviews in magazines, etc. They must pay a lot for marketing. Go with Nord or another reputable company. I regret this purchase. They have been very dishonest with their refund policy so far, and I hope they will refund me like their policy says.

It's like it's 1999...If you go to PROFILE -> SUBSCRIPTION (where it's supposed to live), you can't see ANYTHING related to cancelling the auto-renewal. This is a really nasty case of a dark pattern, and when I explained my situation and asked for a refund at least for the last month that was charged 10 minutes ago (mind you, I haven't used the service in 4 months), they still said no and gave me some nonsense about terms of service.

Spoke to customer service and was told Surfshark's systems can be a bit slow in picking these things up and I should speak to Amazon to get a refund - which is not simple with it being a digital subscription. There's no option to cancel to get a refund, you have to go their customer services chat. Luckily, Amazon chat was very good and they sorted out the issue."

Kill Switch doesn't work AT ALL. The list is pretty long but, last but not least, the support takes days to answer and usually is completely useless. AVOID, cannot really understand recent positive reviews, it's already a couple of years that is an absolute waste of money. Going back to the classics.P.S. The usual answer, contact this and contact that, as, before writing a comment, you didn't already try and gave up. Testing the FREE version of Proton VPN, no problems at all. So, probably, instead of going back to Nord VPN ot VPN Express, that I used in the past, I'll give a shot to their paid version. One final observation: I really don't understand how the guys that gave a good vote could remember the names of the support people. Each time is a different person that, by the way, doesn't read at all the previous conversation with the colleagues. Still one star cause 0 is not possible."

So I had to pay for two addition month of service I didn't need or intended to buy (at total I paid for my 3 month like their 1 year subscription). My advice: Be careful, if you need just a short subscription make sure to cancel it right away (not possible in the app, only via mail or chat) or just go for another service provider with a more transparent service.Edit: After an onther contact with the customer service at least my end of subscription was confirmed.

When I told him that the results were negative and I saw no improvement, he continued to avoid my request, first asking to continue the trial for the remaining days of the free trial, then asking to give the product a second chance, finally reminding me of the dangers present on the web to remain without VPN. I had to ask many times, even harshly in the end, to have a refund. The operator told me that the refund was issued, but I had to spend an hour on it"

          "Contenu": "I signed-up for two years on the basis of the good reviews I read online, but now I am regretting it.1) From the start, I have been unable to send an email without first shutting down the Surfshark app.  I have spoken to the Surfshark help desk twice about it and each time received an unhelpful response (they would look into it and I would know when it was fixed because I wouldn't need to shutdown Surfshark any more - not that they would make an effort to notify me).  So I have put up with it over the past year, but it is irritating and I am unhappy with their muted engagement and limited effort and to-date there has been no solution.2) Recently the app has gone crazy and frequently tries to break the connection/reconnect, seemingly endlessly.  I have tried to shut it down, but that does not work.  A new version of the app was released today [27/11/2023] but it would not install until now - some hours later, after many attempts.  At first the new software would download but get stuck when trying to install, then I could not download it at all and an error message would say 'Try again later'.3) Generally, the reliability of the connection to the web varies considerably - quite often reasonable, but usually not very fast and it has patches of troublesome times and I quite often have to check on it and manually reconnect by trying different countries until something works.4) I don't particularly like the app design - as the main, vertical menu rolls over the top of the options, when open, so it hides the things I am eager to select.  It seems cumbersome to me.Overall, my experience has not been the best and the quality of support, although quick, has not resolved the issue I have been facing at the time, so I don't contact them any more; I have lost confidence in them.I am not going to renew my subscription when this one expires and I intend to look around for alternatives now and may quietly leave this contract early and just forget Surfshark.  I just don't want the hassle of explaining and justifying things that should be a given, when I do not feel that they have made much effort to assist me or keep me informed of any resolutions to reported issues."

But this last week I found out via TheMarkup - Julia Angwin's award-winning online tech watchdog website - that paid VPNs track you - even no-log ones like Surfshark. Surfshark told TheMarkup they track users for marketing purposes in this cutthroat VPN market.I wrote and asked them about their trackers, third-party trackers, use of advertising identifiers, Google Analytics, etc. Their reply: Check our privacy policy - which I should have done more carefully. Like everyone else, they have a long convoluted privacy policy; in fact, they have a multi-layered one that reveals they use third-party providers like Google Analytics and zendesk that also track you and build profiles of you, but it's up to you to read their privacy policies and/or simply \"opt-out\" of Google Analytics which places a Google identifier on your computer. This stuff matters a lot to me - enough so that I'm willing to forfeit my subscription. I am paying for privacy and there are other providers mentioned on TheMarkup that forego third-party providers and (I hope) provide as robust and comprehensive service as Surfshark but without the corporate accoutrements."

The program is *UNFIT FOR PURPOSE * therefore is illegally sold.Surfshark technology is clearly inferior to that commonly employed by many websites,  because they detect the VPN  access as abnormal . Google 'ALWAYS ' does with a challenge that something is wrong considering the access a robot.   CAPTCHA time wasting challenges are very common.  After wasting time with Captcha some websites block  pages. Locktrip.com  blocks the dates - which makes the site unusable.  Aegean airlines blocked payment - a common experience with other sites.

But, a few days ago the connection was CUT... after talking to Surfshark support, it became clear that users from Russia are blocked from connecting with my account and I am from Europe.So, Surfshark, you just lost one of the users... of course, there are many users and will be more, but my disappointment in your political position and unwillingness to check a server did it....Good bye!2 stars of 5."

But found the speed slowed the connection disturbing viewing.  My ip service is gig+ through modem and router, both capable for gig+.Contacted their service department, who were fairly quick to respond (usually no more than about 12 hours, sometimes right away). We exchanged over 100 emails requiring me to spend many hours fiddling without success.  The best they could do was about 30% of my un-VPN connected speed.  This took weeks (was somewhat delayed by vacation as well).  Their final suggestion was to \"contact my internet service provider to see if they could increase my speed\".  Which I actually had done very early in the process.  Xfinity said not possible.So I asked SurfShark to cancel and refund the fee for remaining months, about 20 months.  They said my refund window had closed after 2 months. So I did change to another service that was somewhat faster and much easier to set up.Hope others will be cautious about subscribing."

          "Contenu": "UPDATE2= Support informed me you can now download Surfshark for MacOS via 'App Store' and that version does not add an advertisement to your right-click context menu nor bug you to get their absurd protection software. This is relatively new. I do not know if it is only because App Store programs cannot advertise as such, but no difference to me! Still the Appstore version linked to apple account is less anon than their website version; Still anyone who cares that much wouldnt use Surfshark.... 1 >> 2 stars rating.OG REVIEW=Surfshark has started pushing their antivirus junk software with their VPN app. It is baked into their software, even their MacOS application. They keep adding more annoying mentions of this at every opportunity. They have the nerve to add \"Scan With Surfshark\" to the context menu of Finder. Ironically you have to pay for this antivirus software so it is literally an advertisement every time you right click. Ads are rape. Fuq you surfshark.This can be manually deleted with library change but it is incredibly greasy of them. There is no way to disable it from within Surfshark. AND every update (of which there are many) it adds this context option again. I have written to the company about this and the software only pushes their antivirus junk more.No respect for customer, just shaking them down to get whatever extra bux. Spend a few more dollars on a vpn that is not total scum.UPDATE1= replying to their sheet eating response: I contacted support SEVEN months ago...this is what they said \"At the moment, there's no way to remove it, although hopefully this issue will be fixed with the upcoming updates!\" Given there is only more references to their antivirus software since, I doubt they plan to \"fix\" this \"issue\" ... its not a bug its a feature (advertisement).What even is the point of antivirus on Macos? It is so locked down unix anyway. This is just to shake down the ignorant via fear! About as scummy as a company legally gets."

I don't mind frequent updates, I mind intrusive pop overs. You MUST click the X to close the pop over if you want control of your screen back. When you click the X the full app then pops up. I doubt the developers came up with this idea, it seems like something the marketing team has force upon us and I can't wait for my sub to run out to go back to one of their less intrusive competitors."

Then of course it doesnt remember my pasword - and I dont either - so I have to click forgot password, get an email and then go back to the app and re enter my email and password. It is about an hour or two's work every month - just for a VPN. As a vpn, it seems to work well. Its jus thaving to spend so much time on it thats a pain."

I understood that a VPN can cut off a little bit of your internet speed, but I did not know that it can cut that much..in my case the internet speed was reduced by almost 90% no matter the country I connected to.2. How can you even dare to ask me (a lot of times) if I want to extend my VPN subscription when I just bought a 2 year period????3. There is no refund or cancel the subscription botton on any of the interfaces which tells a lot ....when I first wanted to refund I thought that I was scammed.....4.The live chat botton didn't not work for some time...apparently it was fixed I could ask for what I wanted.5. The email support it is a PAIN. Imaging sensing one email a day to the client and and not even doing what I asked for. Furthermore  they changed the operator from day to day...and I struggled to explain my intention to each one of them.I admit that it is also my fault that I realized after a little bit that I do not need this VPN, I take that blame."

I was able to retrive back my account and looking back, I feel that Surfshark should rethink and rework their automated services that is causing several issues that many of the users are facing, in which in the end still require human intervention."

Despite other VPNs working absolutely fine. All I get is generic messages and scripted responses back like im talking to robots. Since I've come back to surfshark I've had problems with disconnecting, slow speeds and now I can't even connect at all. Incredibly dissapointed with the unprofessional attitudes shown to me. I mean why should I spend 2 days of my time trying to configure my setup like I'm an engineer?I've asked for my money back because I'm not receiving any service at all now for 3 days and won't for the rest of the month as I'm in this country still. How is that not grounds for a refund? Don't bother going with Surfshark. They want your money and do nothing to resolve issues and when you are completely unhappy with the service and are not actually receiving ANY service they would rather you give them bad review than just give you a refund that you deserve..EDIT After discussing the issues outlined above further with Miles, he has commited his time to help me to resolve the situation with the necessary parties involved. I understand that the situation in Egypt for Surfshark is a challenging one and they have assured me that they are doing what they can to provide a solution. Unfortunately at this time it was not possible and so they have provided me with a refund. I would like to take the time to praise Miles's patience, communication skills and dedication to resolving customer problems."

I used a competitors VPN for a couple of yrs and what I hated was almost every site knew I was using a VPN and wouldn't work unless I turned it off. Reviews of Surfshark seem to indicate that this would no longer be an issue. So I switched. Too many times I have to turn off Surfshark just to get anywhere on the Net. So what is the point? This doesn't happen everyday or on every site but it happens enough to be very frustrating. How is it these web sites know I'm trying to get to them via a VPN vice through my carrier directly?"

Somehow Poker Stars still thought I was in the US.  Note that Poker Stars support said I could not use a VPN at all on their site or they would cancel my account."

Compared to Express VPN, the client software is much slower to start. I contacted customer service as the software is not starting at all. Fortunately, Christopher understood my issue and provide a valid solution to it.Now I used OpenVPN to connect to their server and it works perfectly.In fact, they need to improve their client software and Surfshark will be much better.Overall, a good service."

The only way this experience could have been better from the start is if this particular Chromebook problem was already in their knowledge base, but I'm not faulting them for that. Both were patient and good-humored about the whole thing. Good experience, I'll stay with this service."

Their customer service was a joy to work with which I assume improved tremendously over the last few months - know this is something online reviews usually fault them on. I still think they have the best bang(product) for buck in the VPN sector - try them you'll be surprised.I gave them a 4 as there will always be room for improvement."

          "Contenu": "I've used Surfshark for over two years on multiple Windows and Android devices and it has presented very few problems. It has fast speeds, reliable connections, a pretty decent user interface and regular software updates. It's also quite affordable. Plenty of servers and locations to choose from and more security is available for an extra fee (which you may see as a pro or con). The ability to be able to install and use Surfshark on unlimited devices is very handy and I also liked being able to log-in without needing a password (as long as I was already logged in on another device).The only real downside was that there is no option to cancel the auto-renewal in my account settings which is the only time I've had to contact customer support. I'm now using a different VPN simply because my plan was coming to an end and I saw a good deal elsewhere. I do recommend Surfshark as you can't go far wrong with it and who knows, I may end up going back to them sometime in the future."

This is a huge compliment because I sometimes do not understand what I'm being asked by someone who is trying to help.  All I can say is thank you to them for their kind, respectful and effective help!  I'm sure others are having or will have a similar experience."

He answered my specific needs and even waited online thru the set-up and installation process. He provided the specific support links he promised and did not try to sell me anything. He gave me specific options and let me pick exactly what I wanted with the \"Very specific options\" I requited to make me comfortable with the service.I really appreciated his approach to Customer service. it was very refreshing compared to what I have become accustomed to with this new generation. (Older folks just look at the world a little differently I guess).  Any way Mack reminded me of the high level of Customer Service we used to expect."

Jerome joined the chat as Norman's shift was ending and Jerome ensured that an uninterrupted, friendly transition occurred as well as making sure that all of my questions were fully addressed. Jerome also generously invited me to ask additional questions should any arise. Both of these gentleman are consummate professionals, I hope they are meaningfully rewarded for the clear value they add to the organization and I greatly appreciate the exceptional, personalized assistance I received from the dynamic duo of Norman and Jerome. Thank you and happy holidays, gentlemen!"

Elara explained everything clearly and gave me a lot of useful information. She tried different methods and did not give me. She had spent at least two hours on helping me, and I really appreciate her dedication and professionalism. She even taught me how to approach Microsoft support and how to describe my issue with them. All of these are very helpful.Thank you, Elara, for your excellent service!"
