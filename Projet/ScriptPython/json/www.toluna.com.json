It was annoying enough that they charge you a processing fee and only processed payments once a week, which used to be on Mondays with an occasional delay to Tuesday or Wednesday. Then it slid to Thursdays, irritating but at least it was still weekly. Since November it's gone completely downhill--they processed once for the whole month, and anything that has been submitted since then is still stuck in Pending. Tired of being quoted the \"1-3 week\" timeframe (which is BS since every other survey site does them instantly) and now they just keep making excuses about how they've had an overwhelming number of redemptions--blah, blah, blah! Get it together and get us paid in a timely manner--no more excuses."

They will sell your data to research companies, and get paid but will ban your account without warning and forfeit your reward as well as point. So, ultimately you won't be paid for your data. Besides, their reward takes a longer time to arrive (7 days to 10 days) than other sites. At this time if you get a ban, you will lose your account and the reward that you waiting for.   I earned 300k points, using this platform for the last 8 months, and got paid $75. But one morning suddenly they banned my account and forfeited my points which cost $16 of data by saying almost nothing specific. You have seen in the Trustpilot review they doing the same to a lot of users with the excuse of their terms and conditions. So the site is time-killing and doing scams is a smart way. please AVOID the site."

I enquired many times and only after 7 days i got a reply that my account was suspended and guess why cause of they suspect that i have many accounts. Strange Toluna says you can invite people and get 500 points which i have been doing but all of a sudden i have multiple account and strange i only use one account and cash out on one account. They even went to far by declining my rewards that was cashed out while my account was still active. I cant help it if i have a huge family and friend circle and i wanted them to also be part of the Toluna community. They were a very good company that always provided a great service to me but lately their services dropped. If you suspected i have many accounts why wait for 2 years and these suspected account can you prove that i have cashed out on one of them and secondly why decline rewards that has been valid when cashed out? Toluna is getting a 1 star just a pity there is no -10 starts cause thats what i will give them. I have contacted all my friends and family that i have invited to toluna and will show them the treatment Toluna gave me and tell them to unsubscribe from Toluna"

I was paid a little here and there, but when I decided to save my points (95,0000) to redeem for $30 to Paypal, they never paid it. They let me continue doing surveys for two weeks, earning almost 40,000 more points, while I waited for payment. Then with no warning they locked me out and \u201csuspended\u201d my account unjustifiably. They said the account was flagged for \u201cinconsistencies between the data provided in your account and the settings our system is detecting for the machine used to complete surveys; such as using an account in a way that does not match the country of registration.\u201d This is complete garbage because I\u2019m an average US user with an iPhone and no weird settings or anything. Plus I had already been doing surveys with no issues for probably over a month. Total waste of time!"

It's not like you are paying a lot but I guess if 500 people have \"technical issues\" exactly after answering the last question,so when the survey is completed,it adds up to 600000 points which is... what... about 5 euro????

Secondly, sometimes you don't even add up the points, I am completing surveys and everything is fine until the moment when I have to look at my points total to see that even though I have completed the survey correctly, you don't deign to add up my points. Third, the surveys are almost never available, I know that not many of them fit my profile but it is strange that I am the only platform with these problems when in all of them it is almost always the same surveys. And when there is a survey as soon as I open it, it says that it is no longer available even though it appeared a few seconds ago. Finally, their roulette is designed to not even make us earn 10 points, if they will never give surveys at least improve their rewards roulette. It is the worst paid survey platform out there."

It is just so wrong as the client has got all the data gathering and you've got nothing for your time. This has occurred now on several occasions and I feel very conned by this.

Add the fact it's difficult to contact them for real, because they're replying with copy paste or a bot is doing so. If you finally get in touch with a real person, they're making their solutions pretty well, but not always.Also starting a survey for few minutes, and suddenly kicked out, don't bring you any points as a consideration for your work and time. Other survey websites are giving few points atleast even they disqualified you from a survey.The contest section is coming soon since more than a year. There are so many things to improve."

It means I have to set aside significant time and be prepared to waste it and be frustrated. Today I must have been screened out of half a dozen or more plus one that had closed and one that had filled up. It can be very frustrating, but other panels usually don't make panellists suffer in that way - maybe their algorithms are better..."

The surveys Toluna offers are pretty much the best all the way around when it comes to the numerous survey sights that I am a member of and that I participate on a daily basis. The variety of surveys as well as the length of them keep me entertained, engaged, and just overall satisfied while participating in each and every one :) I am also particularly fond of the points system and the rewards that are earned in that points system. They offer a wide variety of gift cards with numerous  categories to chose from, including restaurants and coffee shops like The Cheesecake Factory and Starbucks, chain fast food restaurants like McDonald's, Burger King, and ChicFilA. Big department stores like Walmart and Target. Even grocery stores including Kroger, as well as online shopping options like Amazon and reloadable virtual visa/MasterCard gift cards. Toluna even offers cash out options so you can transfer your points and turn it into immediate cash like PayPal (which of course consists of a few more points needed to earn this option, but totally worth it in my opinion!!) So all and all, Toluna, by far, is one of the best survey sights around and I highly recommend them as my number one and first choice if you are looking to join and  participate in this kind of online extra cash gig!! Each of their surveys are enjoyable and does not bore you into not even finishing. Keep you excited and engaged the entire time. It also educated you in all types of subjects. Thanks Toluna!! You all are seriously the BEST!!"
