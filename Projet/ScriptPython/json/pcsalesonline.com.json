If you have issues you inform, communication drives your online business, my thinking he was doing something else and was either distracted, or worse could care less about a new customer.  I work very hard in a secure data center, when there is an issue affecting customers, the highest priority is to TELL THEM we are having a problem, please wait.  Well PC Sales Online does not do that.  Don't trust them, Best Buy referred them, and it's clear the referral means very little to the.Don't buy from them! if they treat customers this way before you buy, after sales support is very suspect. At least I did not waste any more time, or money.  Lot's of places to buy software, and this also reflects very poorly on Best Buy."

After I paid $48, I was not able to find the download link immediately, once I found a link that looked like the download source, the download process had been interupted many times and costed me a lot of time.  I had fast internet at home, so internet speed was NOT the issue.  I asked for a refund, they refused many times until I reported the fraudulent transaction to my bank.  I Do NOT recommend buying Microsoft products from this site, based on my own experience as a Real Purchaser NOT one of those paid advertisers reviews (majority of their 5-star review sounded generic and paid)\", when I asked for a refund as the refund option had been clearly stated in their terms and conditions for failed download (especially in my case, the license code was NOT activated), the representative who assisted me with the name \"Tom\" blatantly refused to refund me several times and He also acted very unprofessional even nasty hoping to discourage me from getting a refund, and they wasted me a lot of time and resulted frustration. In fact, I am not sure if they are based in the US, because of their poor writing.  Any half decent American online apps stores would be able to refund if there is an installation or system matching issue especially when the license code has NOT been activated or used.  Based on my own experience as a real consumer, that PCSalesOnline appeared to be just trying to hold on to credit card and money, once card info submitted, PCSalesOnline would do anything to discourage your right to a refund which was promised in writing in their terms. I had to report them to my bank.  PCSalesOnline later refunded me after my bank began a fraud investigation.  The money $48 was not big amount, but the level of frustration they had put me through and many hours of time they had wasted me was overwhelming.  Do NOT buy Microsoft products from PCSalesonline to avoid frustration and many many hours wasted is my Recommendation.  If you have similar experience, be sure to contact your bank immediately !"

Putting that information where someone will find it, like on the product page, in the product description!Edit 2:Apparently false advertising can't apply where nuance already has been?The thought that you would hide basic product information in a terms of service page, and not expect customers to be surprised, is absurd. NO ONE would guess that there are hidden attributes of a product just waiting to be discovered in paragraph 4 of a TOS... NO ONE."
