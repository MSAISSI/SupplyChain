Are you serious? Who would ask for something like that?So basically \"these guys\" (probably just one person who replied to me from his mom's basement) wanted access to my whole life...You don't even need any passcode or passwords to hard reset an android device, so the only intention to ask me was just criminal.If there's a reply to this bad review, or not, do not trust this \"company\", I have saved the email, and there's nothing \"they\" can do about it.A total scam, truly criminal.

I'll be sure to use them again if I need to be rid of some old electronics!"

          "Contenu": "Have now sold a Garmin watch, AirPods, and an iPad to techpayout. Only issue with any of the three transactions was that one of the checks got delayed in the mail on its way to me. When I emailed customer service about it they responded within 30 minutes and immediately offered to cancel the original check and issue a new one. That\u2019s better customer service than I would expect from even Amazon. For those skeptical about why they are only reviewed on trust pilot, seems to be because they send a link to the site to review your transaction. They promise to immediately publish all reviews: good, bad, or otherwise. In short, would recommend without reservation."

To clear things up, I just received the check from them today.  It did took longer than was expected for the check to come by postal mail.  However, it was for the same amount exactly as stated by Evan.  Evan have been a great source of comfort and contact from TP.  He was professional and helpful thru out the whole process.  I will definitely deal with them again!!! Highly recommended guys!!!"

After I received the payment for the first cellphone, I obtained a quote for the second cellphone and dropped the package off at the local UPS store.  Three days later I received an email from TechPayout saying that the second cellphone had been received and was accepted with no changes to the quote, which was the same result I received with the first cellphone.
