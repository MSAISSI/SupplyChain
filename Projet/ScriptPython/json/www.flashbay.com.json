The logo was correct but 2.0 not 3.0. I immediately contacted my rep.  Apologies with a partial refund? These cost nothing, I\u2019m paying a premium! Since asking for a full refund and return if wrong product I\u2019ve heard nothing. Ironically, when ordering, emails, phone calls and all kinds of attention. Too bad. I will follow up with end result. Hopefully this review can be updated soon"

I wrote back and told Esther/Kristine that it was a bit more than I was able to spend, could she please send the quote for 25 units. Instead of sending me the quote, she asked me what my budget was. I told her what I'd LIKE to spend and she said they couldn't do that. She still didn't send the quote for 25. And the letter continued with reasons why they were more expensive, but the writing wasn't even correct English so I feel like the entire thing is suspect."

Calls from Flashbay's sales rep every single morning just to reach out were unnecessary. I understand sales goals and meeting margins, but it was to the point the company looked greedy."

She followed up after I received my order to make sure everything arrived as it should. \r However a company policy made ordering very frustrating. If you are paying with a credit card the billing and shipping addresses have to match. With a company that is spread throughout the United States it turned out to be quite the hassle to mail the flash drives to my sales representative who will be handing out the flash drives. I had to put the order on his personal credit card and reimburse him for the costs rather than using a company card. Definitely not an ideal ordering situation."

I figured it would be a simple job because we had it shipped to Santa Clara, however the headache came when my expectations of arrival was put into question. This wasted much of my time and made me focus on what should have been your company's dealings. \r Thankfully, Vanessa helped a lot and stayed in touch with me on an almost day-to-day basis and calmed my nerves. I appreciate her work but am perturbed that nowhere on your site was the information readily available that they were made and shipped from China."

          "Contenu": "Although I'm quite pleased with the product itself, Flashbay makes it about as complicated as they possibly can for a customer to actually buy from them.  The minimum order is prohibitively high (kept me from using them the last two wedding seasons) and it doesn't allow you to customize each drive individually.  They also make you go through a rather silly process of requesting a temporary password that has to be emailed after a sales rep gets in touch with you either over the phone or through email.  From there, you have to log in to be able to see your options/ prices, upload your images, branding, etc. and wait again for a sales rep to get in touch with you.  A designer sends you a proof with the best approximation of the images/branding you uploaded (it's nowhere near as specific or automated as say designing business cards) you make corrections if necessary, and then... finally, the send out your order.  All told, it took 6 days to go through the whole process; in comparison, the very similar process of ordering business cards takes me about 15 minutes.  Shipping was fast, to their credit.  Like I said, I've quite happy with the product itself, but if another company offered the same with a streamlined ordering process, and no enormous minimums, I'd switch to them in a heartbeat."

          "Contenu": "My experience started out great. I was looking at ordering either 50 or 100 USB's for my company with our logo. I had my mind set on a particular style but after my account manager got in touch with me and sent me a sample box, I was intrigued by the \"on the go\" styles that offered a second port you could plug into your mobile devices. My account manager was quick to respond and follow up with quotes and info I requested. I asked whether the port would be compatible with our company phones (iPhone 7 and iPhone 6s - same port) and was told it would be.Here are the exact words of my account manager \u201cYes, it will definitely fit into an iPhone 6S and other iPhone models with a USB-C port\u201dAnd then when I asked this again just to be 100% sure before ordering he replied with \u201cYes, if you choose the USB-C connector, it will fit the iPhone 7\u201d so I placed the order for 100 of these flash drives without hesitation. Keep in mind, these were more expensive than the original style we had planned to order. When I received the USB's I was excited to plug them into my phone and test out how we could share info on our company phones. However, I was very disappointed to quickly realize they do not fit into our phones. Not even close. I immediately contacted my account manager about this issue. I told him how dissapointed I was that I was mislead to believe these were compatible with our company iPhones. This was over a week ago and this issue has still not been resolved. My account manager has been so slow to get back to me with solutions to this issue. Always calling this an \"inconvenience\" and never acknowledging his mistake. He now tells me all the devices this USB IS compatible with which does not make a shred of difference to me since they are useless in our phones which is why we purchased them. I have had to follow up several times when he hasn't got back to me when he says he is going to. Always saying he is waiting on his \"Quality Control Team\" and he appreciates my patience. I have asked for a manager to get back to me on this issue and this request was ignored. At this point I have been offered 30% off on my next order but there will be no next order. I shouldn't be paying full price for a product that does not do what was promised and I shouldn't be waiting over a week for a solution when he was so quick to respond to every email prior to this order being placed. I have asked again in big bold letters for a manager to contact me and that is where this issue now stands...Edited to add a manager did reach out to me and resolved this issue. I was offered a partial refund to compensate for this error which I accepted. I appreciate the quick follow up once I escalated the issue."

          "Contenu": "Our overall experience with Flashbay was positive, resulting in a high-quality product. However, there was a minor hiccup that caught us off guard. When we were ready to proceed with our order, we were informed that the product had to be shipped to the billing address, with no option for separate shipping addresses. This was a departure from our usual experiences with vendors, as we routinely handle orders on behalf of our clients.This deviation from the norm raised concerns and almost led us to explore other options for our business needs. Fortunately, the Flashbay team, during my ordering process, accommodated our request and allowed a separate shipping address. While we appreciate their flexibility in this instance, it has given us some pause about future orders.It is our sincere hope that Flashbay reevaluates and potentially revises this policy in the future. Our team was genuinely impressed with the quality of the notebooks we received, and we would gladly consider ordering from Flashbay again if this shipping address restriction were addressed."

Again, everything turned out great. That was just a hiccup in the process. Thank you Flashbay!"

When we placed the order, found that we were facing an additional $25 or so for that to happen.  Second, we were somewhat surprised when our products arrived from China.  We had been in touch and working with a company in CA, USA."

From the moment we placed our order for water bottles, Jill's swiftness in getting them to us was truly remarkable. Jill's efficiency stood out right from the start. Our order was processed promptly, and within no time, she ensured that our water bottles were on their way to us. This level of responsiveness is a rarity and certainly made our experience with her stand out. Not only was Jill quick in delivering the goods, but the quality of the water bottles exceeded our expectations. The bottles were sturdy and well-printed. Thanks,"
