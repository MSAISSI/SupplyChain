If using Nyx, it's 48 seconds pear each second of footage. Using Proteus, it's 25 seconds per each second. 3) The most frustrating: There are still several features to be tested. But: how? Every time I want to test something, I need to plan to lose 1 hour of my work, just to see the results, even on a 15-second video.So there you have it.

It makes your images look like they have a filter on them.  In my experience, it makes the skin look like someone ramped up the Luminosity, giving it that dreadful \"Plastic\" look.  When you use the tools, it will mask out the face however it will not adjust any of the other exposed skin so it doesn't match.  If this thing cost like $50, it would be fine, but it costs a lot of money, and you only get one upgrade so long as it falls within the year of your purchase, otherwise you have to buy it again if you want later updates.  I feel like you could probably get similar results using older sharpening methods and the denoising isn't very good, especially if you have other exposed skin that you'll have to adjust manually anyway."

In particular, walking shots, where Da Vinci Resolve Studio and After Effects CS5 both struggle with frames where one leg crosses in front of the other, or moves too far from one frame to the next.  Video AI is similar to Da Vinci in that it does not seem to drag parts of the background along like AE does, but it is worse with parts of the leg disappearing in the new frames.  It also had problems with a repeating pattern of roof shingles (a Baba Yaga hut with shingles, and chicken legs walking, in case you wonder how those things go together).  DaV also had weird ripples in the shingles, but AE did not.  Like other software, there are online videos showing how well Video AI does slowing down simple objects like a moving car, but it has the same limitations with more complex objects changing in shape as they move.  I can see it has many good points, but failed at the one task I needed it for.  I should have downloaded a free demo and tested it first."

I had artifacts on several test images processed in Photo AI compared to other apps.not Topaz's CS was unhelpful, just sending some basic generic tips that I already tried so I had to trouble shoot on my own to get the app to work.

I gave the above mentioned stand alone apps a 5 star rating before and now the 'one size fits all' Topaz Photo AI 2 gets only 2 stars. Topaz should not dumb down performance in the spirit of simplification. I would suggest (I am a well paid consultant in other industries and you get this advice for free) that you keep a simple exterior and appeal to the masses, BUT have access to the expert capabilities through pull down menus that allow for the same level of control. The current level of control is disappointing in the combined suite. The stand alone apps likely will not be supported well in the future. With the old control afforded by the standalone accessible via pull down menus it would be possible to create an integrated product and not loose for your expert users. The masses could use the auto pilot, while experts can tune... you can have your cake and eat it too... right now I am hungry having lost the calories associated with those lost 3 stars."

I even applied it to some images I took this year on my Nikon and did not get anywhere near the results I see on your website or on line. I feel I just wasted $200 unless you have a return policy.

Unless the exposure and white balance is ideal, starting out with Topaz to process/de-noise raw images is a lost cause.  I've had to go first to NX Studio to correct exposure and sharpen, export as .tif and then to Topaz to de-noise and sharpen get acceptable results. It somewhat defeats the purpose of being able to efficiently process photos within the Topaz suite. Or at minimum to use Topaz as a first de-noise step. Happy to hear any suggestions."

But, there's not much option to filter faces in a way that they don't age up a smiling 20yr old, to look like they're 80 having ptsd. I miss the beautification option that Remini achieves for closer faces. You'll still need to do some heavy lifting in pre/post production in photoshop to fix its many mistakes and wrinkly artifacting. You'll learn there's no point in installing updates as they typically ruin the program further. However,  this is preferred as a one time purchase in a world where subscription services are often the only choice. So I appreciate not being tied to a subscription, which is what ultimately won me over to this program over other options."

Are they using your software or something similar on their website? I think my results using Topaz are better, but I'm just curious if you have any information in that regard.Thanks for your help!Robert"

Many times when using the program to upscale an image, the result looks overly AI generated. As I've only been using it for a fairly short time, I still want to play with the settings more and several different types of images to really get to know the product better. However, I have used it several times a day since my purchase--and I have an issue at launch (whether it be an ICC error code, a failure to recognize code, or something else) around 60% of the time. I did reach out to TopazLabs for assistance and they got back to be in a reasonable timeframe and basically told me that if I can't get it to work to send them more information, which they specified for me. I don't know if the same issues occur when using the application directly because I purchased it mainly to help with things I need in PhotoShop and find it more convenient. I am excited about the possibilities, but still find it to have several issues that need to be worked out."

The new preview system to compare multiple setting is great, I do miss the live update as the frames render though so you can see how much longer you have until it finishes.

The faces can come out slightly plastic-looking at first and may have to be toned back, so don't just accept the auto-setting image."

Could it be an idea to have the option to pause the recalculation until all the parameters have been changed?Would also like the ability to rotate images, now I have to do this in other software,I have both TOPAZ for photo and video.

          "Contenu": "I recently bought Photo A.I.  The enhancement macro is similar to the one available in Adobe Raw.   It has been very useful in extracting detail from TIFF scans of black and white negatives and color slides.   The noise filter does a nice job with the grain on the black and white negatives. When using the noise, sharpening and face macros, it makes sense to create another layer in Adobe Photoshop, so you can tone down the softening by dropping the opacity.  In addition, a mask allows you to confine the macro to a particular part of the image.   The face macro works best with large faces.  As the faces get smaller in the overall image, the output can look like a Francis Bacon painting.  There is a softening effect similar to the Dynamic Skin Softener in Color Efex Pro, although in that case, I usually use a white mask and black paint brush to limit the impact on the eyes, nose and lips.  All in all, I got what I needed and feel that I got my money's worth.  I look forward to future improvements."

I am stil confused as to how Topaz markets photo AI vs. the individua pacakges we all purchased before.  It appears that Photo AI has taken over everything but that is never made clear.Despite this confusion in marketing, the photo AI package is now th eonly software from Topaz that I use and denoise/sharpen Ai sit idle.  Not sure yet how gigapixel compares to Photo AI as I use that a lot less.Not quite sure if Phot IA denoising is as agood as pureRaw 3 or adobe enhance but th ehuge beneift is tha you can use topaz late in the editing process on seleted parts of an image.Software very high marks - clearity of marketing and web site - less so!!"

I have seen hands that look gnarly after using Topaz.  I was advised to just use the upscaling and that is somewhat better for preventing distortion but it does not give the level of crispness that you receive for faces.  My guess is that the AI can be better tuned for faces, but the algorithm or learning process for the software is more difficult to perfect when the choices are much greater."

The light adjustment is mediocre at best and the color adjust slightly better. (These addons are not a deal breaker for me).I was unable to find the answers I needed in the help section.I am exceptionally happy with Topaz's system of sharpening and reducing noise.  It is amazing and well worth the investment! It brings back most of my old, discarded pics to life!"

It generally works pretty well in auto but you have the options to tweak the settings yourself. It can be a great time saver to quickly fix a photo or a good starting point if you know the photo needs something but aren't sure how or what it needs. They have basically taken the standalone apps and put them in photo AI so you can change the parameters in one program, scaling, denoise, and sharpening. It also adds recover faces. I don't know if the standalone apps will continue, the updates are few and far between. I hope they do. The advantages of the standalone apps is you can set them to compare mode and have 4 different modes side by side so you can easily see which is the best mode to use. You can select different modes in photo AI but you change it, wait for the refresh and have to remember what the previous one looked like. Not the same at all. The side by side comparison is a great feature. You can see how they compare in detail. It would be great if it could somehow be incorporated into photo AI. So all in all great for someone who wants their photo to look better with the click of a button or a 1st step in a processing workflow."
