I found the experience incredibly frustrating, and weeks later still haven't got it working to my satisfaction - veering between having multiple nested copies or no copies. The principle reason is the insistence in all the help documents that a NAS is just the same as another computer (try sending an email with a link to a NAS), so apart from the documents detailing the differences in how to install the app to different brands of NAS, all the help documents assume that your other device is either another computer, or a mobile device (for which the instructions are much clearer).

Second note about linking - it is very confusing - I install to one PC, it ask me for a user name. On other PC it requested also password - shall I use same user name as first computer? what about the password ?! Later I found that I don't need second identity/cerficitates (maybe ?!). Than mobile phone, cool just making a picture. Third computer, again some username, then to settings, linking, but I'm afraid I will loose or kick my previous computers. Shall I link from first to second, from second to third, from third to first or second ?! ... ok, I somehow managed this out. Than I found that my windows computer won't link anymore.As user, I want to have it simple and clear.Write name of device, Copy-paste a code (or type) and click \"OK\". In case of webui I understand that I need to enter also User/pass, but the purpose of the input must be clear.good luck bye !"

I can honestly say I have a good knowledge of PC's, but this has taken me a day of work to get things fixed with the forum which is just not OK. To make things worse support is not exactly quick with their replies, I've been waiting for 3 working days, just for two of the above mentioned issues. So as there is no chance for me to get this fixed on the short term, I asked for a refund. I'll definitely try again if it still exists in a couple of years to see if it has matured, but in it's current state it just doesn't seem usable."

After a week my forum registration still hasn't been approved, despite I reminded of myself twice.I'm disappointed that there is no a server-type installation of the Sync, e.g. for a home server (FreeBSD, Linux) or NAS. The main idea is that such a server can serve as an endpoint not just for one client, as it is now, unfortunatelly, but for many making the solution more convenient and similar to the traditional cloud-based services. It's very simple to implement and it costs nothing. I could not imagine that it hasn't implemented yet. Once again, if you buy a Family license that includes a few users and you have a home server or NAS, than only one user can sync with a node on the server. It's a shame.I hope it will be fixed soon."

          "Contenu": "Does the software sync data? yes. However it feels incomplete. For starters the web interface when installing on a NAS is clunky. Especially when accessing remotely. For me, it required the use of Tailscale and the NAS DSM manager at the same time in two windows to know where and what I was syncing. If the NAS version of the software had a native GUI in Synology DSM and QNAP that would increase ease of use and setup for people that aren't quite as techy. The software lacks viability into sync errors. I'm trying to sync some directories from NAS A to NAS B in read-only mode (to NAS B). simple enough. Target NAS B shows a sync error. However it doesn't say what file(s) is causing the error. There's no pointer to the offending log file line. There's no way (I can see) to dismiss the error. Sync progress is obstructed while the error is in place. The selective sync screen is a little laggy as well as limited in functionality. When I select \"sync\" on some sub-folder it sometimes takes a good 30 seconds to turn from unselected to selected. This UI change should be instant. Even if the underlying sync engine hasn't fully turned over to actually start syncing. At the very least toss in a spinning wheel while it's thinking so the user knows their input has been registered. The Selective Sync screen on a NAS web interface is limited. No search feature to find a folder or file in a large structure. No ability to select multiple files and folders at once. No ability to re-size the dialog window. Lastly, the NAS web GUI has many functions hidden and is inconsistent. With a \"sync all\" folder clicking on the share name does nothing. With a \"selective sync\" folder the same action brings up a browser to select what items are synced and what items are not. This should be a dedicated button so it's more clear when clicking the folder name will do nothing and when it will do something. A little more attention to the Web GUI would go a LONG way to making this more pleasant to use."

Because each file is a separate torrent file, and it seems like it transmits only one at a time, with a long wait in between, it is extremely slow, cumbersome, and actually fails on large directories. This has been my experience, and checking that firewall issues and advanced settings were not the issue, I threw up my hands at this.To solve this issue, I ended up zipping large directories to create fewer large files, and this of course worked beautifully.

I've paid for this service and it's been years without a proper Linux client.Edit: Since Resilio replied, I'll add this to my review: help.resilio. com /hc/en-us/articles/204762449-Guide-to-LinuxThat includes the list of \"peculiarities\" that exist on the Linux client. And that is if you can even get it running properly. \"Resources\" is a poor excuse as to why they don't have a native GUI client. Flatpacks? Snaps? App Images? Linux is expanding into the consumer market and they can't even be bothered to create a proper client. They are paying someone to reply with excuses though.Another Update: To be clear, I'm not asking for a refund. The product works very well on supported platforms. I use it on my Synology NAS, Windows Desktop and Macbook. I depend on it daily and it works well. My issue is my primary platform is Linux and the support for Linux is very lacking."

I have both Firefox and Chrome installed, both up to date, and the os up to date but it tells me i have to update one or both of them before it can run. It struggles to sync to that computer and doesn't run reliably when i finally get it to run in a browser because it never runs on its own.That said, i have been looking for a way to get away from Dropbox for a long time. I never liked that i had to store things on their server to begin with, but their website was useless to me (the organization is mediocre at best, and since i don't use MS Office i can't use it to preview or edit my files) with Paper being the only feature i occasionally use. For Paper, Google Docs and Sheets are overwhelmingly better and more useful. Dropbox mobile app is completely useless because i have to download everything twice (once for it to try and preview, then a second time to actually open the file); can't automatically download everything, can't choose where the download goes to on the device, and can't use the SD card on the device.Resilio doesn't try to preview the files, so that is a big plus for it. It lets me choose where the files get stored on each device. I get to sync files differently (have a folder to sync files for my phones/tablets and folders to sync other files between laptops and desktops, with yet other files to sync between just the desktops). I get to save the file to the SD card. It is capable of syncing on any network the devices are connected to. It is extremely faster than Dropbox and doesn't use internet to do so. This program is nearly perfect in my opinion, but not being stable on Windows 7 is a big hit since i won't upgrade my desktops to window 10 until i absolutely have to."

          "Contenu": "...Okay, \"friction,\" as worded by Trustpilot, is not an accurate word in my case; I have had no friction with Resilio's staff--in fact, the one or two times I reached out to them they were forthcoming, no problem.  But I did not want to give my overall experience a four-star rating, for the following reason:Resilio Sync is an amazing product/service--all my tech-head associates agree.  And the one time I got it to work properly, I did glimpse a brave new world.  The problem is not with Sync; it's that, though I believe I've read through all the many brief and medium-length documents made available by Resilio, I still don't know that I've set it up properly for what I want it to do, and I still am not confident, each time I try to use it, that I'm following the correct steps.  Clearly, the documentation works for a great many people, but everyone is different, and it hasn't worked for me.  Further, I have searched YouTube for instructional videos and found only one or two, produced by third-party individuals; those were more about what Sync could do, than exactly how to do it.  (I have not done a document or video search in about six months now, so if there are newer resources than that out there, this will be outdated information.)I have the desire to make good use of Resilio Sync, but have thus far been discouraged, and my schedule has not allowed me to just focus on it and 'break its back'.  I wish there were a few videos/documents that took one step-by-step through the set-up and use process, for INDIVIDUAL USE CASES (pardon the capitals):  1) If you want to send someone one large file, do this--from start to finish.  2) If you want to give someone access to a whole folder, do this--from start to finish.  3)  If someone who has a Sync account wants to share something with you and you need to set up the free version of Sync, do this--from start to finish.  4)  If you want to set Sync up as a personal server (or whatever), do this--from start to finish.  Etc.Thanks very much for reading!  I do look forward to being able to use Sync properly one day.  Best regards."

I had messed around with other platforms like NextCloud and OwnCloud but after a while of doing more maintenance than actual use I gave up and went with a professionally developed platform. The cost of Resilio is worth every cent and for what you are getting, I feel it is worth it. I appreciate OpenSource software, it has its place, but if a consumer wants something to work reliably then it is worth making the investment. I would rate this a perfect 5 stars, however, the documentation really needs to be worked on. Explanation of the ID platform is about as clear as mud and the differences in Tiers and what you get with each tier was buried deep into their support site. I had purchased the family plan thinking that with 2 people accessing my server that is what I needed. That was not so. I needed to reach out to support to get the information I needed and ended up returning my family plan and getting the Single user. All in all, very worth it. Very happy that it is easy and...just works. No messing around with it. Set it and forget it.  Thank you!"

It'd be also great if there was a way to link devices without having to manually connect each device with each-other.  Also, a way to change folder names and identity names without having to remove/re-add them would be handy...I'm still not totally sure how I was able to do it.

Adding two different folders that have the same stuff in them. Just yesterday I wanted to add my two music folders. One on my PC, the other on a SD card on my phone. This way its way easier to keep my music synced with a master library. I start doing that and Sync says there is stuff already in the folder. Yeah, duh I know, Its the exact same POOP, except for one album. Maybe the option to have a one way mirror a folder. I had to delete all the music on my phone so there wouldn't be any issues. 3. Yesterday when I was setting up the music sync, I did it on the wrong computer. I should have done it on my server computer where the music is, but I did it on my pc. Now I have to set that up to do that. I don't know how, and I might have to delete all my music again just so I can have it as I want."

I've linked it to a few key folders so my Desktop is always in sync and I've never once opened an older version of a document. I really recommend this over a few other big competitors who I've found either slow (as in days to just create file placeholders) or very readily creates conflicts. Keep up the good work!"

It replaces with another symbol and duplicates the folder. I do light video production, and I back up my 2019 Mac's \"Movies\" Folder with all my Final Cut Pro Libraries ONLY to the PC and have given the PC \"Read-only\" privileges.

          "Contenu": "It has proven to be an exceptional companion!Utilizing my Synology NAS as the central server, seamlessly linked to all my directories, I've achieved something truly remarkable. I've established a personalized cloud infrastructure that boasts a multitude of customization options.Sharing nearly 60GB of personal data with my brother in a different country has been a breeze, thanks to this setup. This accomplishment would have been unattainable through costly cloud storage solutions alone. Furthermore, this investment represents a one-time expenditure, a preferable alternative to the ongoing monthly subscriptions of conventional cloud services.My brother opted for a more budget-friendly iPhone with limited storage capacity, which inevitably led him to shy away from taking photos to avoid memory shortage problems. However, upon his return home, all the files seamlessly synchronize with his laptop. While there is a minor issue with iOS requiring the Sync app to be opened, Android's operating system facilitates automatic syncing without manual intervention.Admittedly, I initially had reservations about this purchase due to my unfamiliarity with the app. Yet, as time passed, my perspective evolved, and I now consider it one of the most astute investments I've made thus far.Presently, my devices harmoniously sync critical data flawlessly across various platforms. I effortlessly utilize a mix of Mac, PC, iPhone, iPad, and Synology NAS without encountering any synchronization issues.For those seeking to synchronize data seamlessly across devices, eliminating the need for cumbersome cables and intricate software, this solution comes highly recommended. With just a single computer and a phone, the data transfer process is streamlined and efficient."

However, upon actual use, it's cumbersome to setup. I'm an IT person and even though I was able to set it up successfully with all of my devices, I had to document the process. And when I'm adding a new device, I have to look at that and make sure that everything works. There were quirks here and there. And then Resilio Sync came along. I was just browsing at their website and was surprised to see a 50% discount. So i bought the Family license at 50usd even though I haven't tried it. Boy I was utterly surprised how easy it is without looking at the documentation. I just had to experiment a little to ensure that my files won't be deleted. And it worked! One thing that I love about Resilio is that my Synology NAS has a native app for it. So my files from my PCs and laptops sync to my NAS1 and NAS1 syncs to NAS2 and NAS2 syncs to the cloud (using iDrive which I also love!!). Now, i don't even have to worry for a second if I overwrite or delete files since Resilio and iDrive has versioning. I also sync my backups to pCloud as my 4th backup destination. I have backups all over the place 'coz I'm a paranoid storage hoarder! Lol."

          "Contenu": "USING FOR PERSONAL USE!!!Even though the product failed in so many ways, it did not meet all or many of my expectorated uses. It's not what I expected. I was expecting to purchase something with a login and a password, that let me create 5 users, on MY giant Synology NAS... but that is not the case.I would like to have then creat sub-folders for those users on MY giant Synology NAS, so that each of them can have a username and a password to dump/sync all and everything about their lives, in a centralized, divided, personalized way. But instead, it has this SUPER ugly and clumsy way of sharing a license file. C'mon, people at Resilio, that is a horrible way of creating a Family Package. You overly complicated something really, really good here. Your use of a license FILE key, is simply too much... just give out one ALPHANUMERIC license KEY code that can be easily, meaninglessly registered and shared. It's only a file-sharing system, and the implantation makes it seem way-way over protective. This software is NOT handling my the back-end of my bank! And, it is NOT handling my hospital electronic medical records systems. Also, please please please.. read this part: you CANNOT expect that each and every user out there has the centralized capacity to synchronize to their own systems, and don't go down the path of saying the word \"cloud.\"You want a good statistical number? Did you know that many people have cell phones and tablet devices with storage that is GREATER than that of the storage on their computer? It is a true, known fact! There are so many laptops out there than only come with 128GB or 256GB of storage, because of SSD storage technologies, while a cell phone comes with storage capacities greater than 256GB. So in this scenario, you expected consumer's are supposed to know about ALL of this stuff? Most people have been spoiled for years, and have not had the need to worry about running out of storage. However, the configuration and model setup of your software just ignores your average person's knowledge of storage (needs).Why am I giving you 5-stars, when I've stated many complaints? Because you have a great product here, free or not... you have an easy fix to correspond to a user's needs. All you need to do, is create 1) a main login and that becomes the first user of the family package, 2) allow 4 more users to be created, maybe with their own key, or an invite link, 3) allow everyone the option to either a) create a central point of sync storage on their own home computer, or b) create a central point of sync storage on the MAIN user's system -- the account holder of the Reilis Sync product, 4) allowing such decision, a request and approval process would be nice.... everything else would be magical.IMPORTANT! Fix your damn app, at least the one for iOS / iphone. I have over 300,000 photos and the app never begins to transfer a single photo because it's too busy \"Indexing...\" Your app should see \"WOW lots of files here! Let's start sections at a time, and go from there.\" But even worse, the app crashes! OMG, does that mean the indexing has to start all over? I gave up entirely on the app, Amazon has a way BETTER photo backup setup, with a simple app that IMMEDIATELY starts backing up when you open the app.(sorry for any typos, writing too fast, so munch to write about, and could probably write more)(also, by know means am I saying this is the WORST software ever... I think everyone should give it a try, and tinker with it a bit, because it might perfectly work out well for you!)GOOD LUCK, EVERYONE!!!"
