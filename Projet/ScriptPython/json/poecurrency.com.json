During the whole process I stayed on chat with their support and requested updates every 30 minutes. While their demeanor was friendly enough if you asked a question they didn\u2019t want to answer they would copy and paste a generic answer and ignore you. My advise is find another company to buy currency from if your going to buy any real amount of currency."

Anytime I'd order orbs of scouring or alchemy orbs, I'm always told \"We're out of stock, can we give you exalts or chaos orbs in replacement?\" Which I would normally agree on, but then they're out of stock on those as well???Would highly recommend going somewhere else, this site is NOT reliable. They don't even update their site with a \"Out of Stock\" sign on their items. Very unprofessional."

If you have no stock you should disable your buy button.  No body got time to stay online all day just to wait and hope you will deliver.  Customer service was also useless and did nothing to fix the issue.  I gave them many chances to fix the problem but would answer with generic messages saying to \"stay online\".

I waited about 40 mins and then contacted customer service who stated that it was busy and may take longer due to a recent update/new season. I then waited 40 more mins. \"Ryan\" my customer service stated that I didn't know anything and I should be more patient. I asked Ryan if he knew how long this would take. He told me to wait longer. Ryan then went on a long dissertation how I didn't know anything. I then sent an email to there customer service stating how Ryan hasn't been the best customer service. I get a reply that says \" Ryan has been fired\" clearly he wasn't because he kept contacting me.  I then asked how I could get my product. They wanted me to send 2 pictures. One of my credit card. The second of my receipt from PayPal account showing I paid.  I asked why. They said they needed to verify I didn't steal this card. PayPal is the one who is verifying my payment not this site.  I then asked for a refund. He then started questioning why I needed a refund. This went on for another 30 mins. Ryan is still messaging me asking  why, and refusing to give me my refund. I now have to wait 30 days to receive my money back from PayPal.  DONT USE THIS SITE."

          "Contenu": "I was kicked offline and banned within 5 minutes of completing this trade. The same thing happened a year ago to another account. I'm not sure if it's the seller's account getting banned and traced to me but I followed PoECurrency's instructions perfectly. I ordered a rather small amount of currency too so it wasn't like I was buying mirrors. Support doesn't do anything in this case other than tell you to appeal, for which there's obviously no valid excuse you can provide the game company. Save your money as you will not get it back. I'd give this a 1 out of 5, except I purchased knowing the inherent risk.Edit:Editing this due to what has happened after posting my initial review. POECurrency has gone as far as to ask for my account information so that they can submit an appeal on my behalf (like I somehow can't do that myself). The last thing I want is an appeal done in broken English. I have already appealed and it was denied - which is fair enough, I know I broke the rules. They have edited their response to this review to a completely new message claiming that this has never happened before. Several other reviewers would tend to disagree with that. Additionally, it happened to me more than a year ago the first time so there's been two bans already just with one customer. They have emailed me a few times pushing me towards their live chat and have even gone as far as to send me a text message about this review, it's very pushy!There's one line in the vendor's reply that really caused me to want to edit this instead of leaving it alone. \"We dont know whether you have break other game rules or not\". I'm sorry, but no... other than the trades done with this company the account hasn't even sent a single chat message since its creation a few months ago. The ban was under 5 minutes from them trading me 200 divines in exchange for a few rares that I even chaos/exalted in advance.Overall, I know it's hard for Poecurrency to circumvent auto bans. I did my best to avoid it by getting the account above level 90 but I guess simply being above 25 and trading rares no longer cuts it for safety. I'd be fine saying \"whatever\" but this company is going out of their way to play victim and I just find that irritating. I wish I could respond to their \"reply\" without needing to edit the base review but that's how this site works."

This was my first order and I ordered while creating an account, so the order did not show up in my account. But I have an email receipt from Pay Pal to show the customer service. Providing receipt of payment and keeping in communication, they did fulfill the order! Thanks for the fast service. Some of these services are in different countries so Pay Pal, Google Pay, or your bank may slow down the process. This company has no control over how fast the payment verification goes. But they do have control over communicating with the customer. I gave them a chance, and it worked out well. Thanks POEcurrency."
