This is a good policy unless, you never got the product. FedEx held the package for over a week before even attempting to deliver it, by this time the person it was perchanced for made other arrangements leaving me with nothing no package no refund. When I tryed to explain this delivery problem to the woman who answered the phones she told me about the policy then hung up the phone. So say very bad customer service. As of this writing I still have not received my refund."

This is the third inverter/charger I have received from the Inverter Store and the first I have found a broken piece.

Only reason I can give two stars is because I really like the inverter.Edit:Not a very useful reply. I will of course be checking with international sellers in regard to this in the future. However,  I have made many purchases internationally in the past and have never had this happen. So I recommend that in the future you make it clear to customers with international addresses that they will need to handle brokerage for their packages. Your reply also does not address my primary concern which is that someone on your team hung up the phone on me. Because of this I am lowering this review to 1 star."

However,  Skye did somehow find time to tell me during this complicated \"warranty\" return process, that I would have to pay for shipping to get it to them for any \"warranty\" (the bait?). Nothing but crickets regarding a MUCH higher, or ANY return shipping costs to me in order to get my original battery back?!  Please don't blame me for being doubtful about the \"failed warranty\", or \"within spec\" test results at this point. Or,  for feeling scammed by what I consider \"the switch\".   Skyes' lack of transparency, and honesty regarding return to Owner shipping costs likely wasn't accidental, or inadvertent. This whole return, & so called \"warranty\" transaction was definitely not transparent, or honest... Therefore I do NOT recommend this business."

          "Contenu": "Let me first say that I have used AIMS inverters and other products for quite a while and have found the products to be second to none in terms of performance and reliability. I will also say that their technical support people are unbelievably knowledgeable, helpful and available. I purchased the AIMS 3200 watt portable generator based on that experience and because of the auto start feature on this generator. It was compatible with my inverter and pointed toward a solution I was striving to achieve. I purchased AIMS LiFePo4 batteries, which are awesome and rebuilt my entire power station based on the auto start feature of this generator. When I had the entire system rebuilt, I put it to the test. It failed the test. When the inverter told the gen to start, it tried to start but did not. I reset the test multiple times and it failed every time. When I spoke to tech support, they asked about the outside temperature and when I told them it was slightly below freezing, they indicated that the lower operating range was about 30 degrees for a start. Given that temperature had a lot to do with the reason for converting to auto start, this rendered the generator useless to me. Despite the issue, when I returned the generator for a refund, I had to pay shipping for the return, a 20% restock fee and their cost of the initial shipping, a loss to me of about $350. I have reviewed the descriptions of this generator and there is no mention of this shortcoming. Given that a portable generator has it's place in cold surrondings, winter RVers, mountain cabins, etc., this seems to be a appropriate issue to mention. I feel a bit ripped off by my loss of $350. I'll likely continue to purchase AIMS products (assuming one of my inverters ever fails) but I certainly would not recommend this particular product."

I had to make cross struts as no small expense, and got them mounted.  This unit is extremely unwieldy and difficult to obtain correct solar angles, much less tring to do it alone!

So i replied back to Jay Jones who issued the RMA#. Stating that i don't see how we should be responsible for the cost to ship their product that is defective right out of the box, especially since it is due to no fault of our own. And if this is the case, i just as soon return the entire order for a refund. Cut my losses on the return shipping, and purchase an inverter from another manufacturer. That's when communication ended on their end, there has yet to be a response back"

          "Contenu": "Purchased a 6000 watt inverter charger through the inverter store.  Installed it in my boat and had several problems.  It took several calls to tech support and if you don't get someone just hang up and call back because out of 5 messages, never once was a call returned.  Had to go through customer services to get an RMA to send the until back for repair.  $209 out of my pocket in shipping cost to send it back and  when it got to them they said it was destroyed in shipping.  I agree it was destroyed, and I even gave the UPS store a printed copy of the packing instructions.  I told them that I still needed a replacement unit, as that was the heart of my electrical system because of the way it has to be wired in.  I got a link to there website as a response from technical support.  It wasn't even a link to the correct replacement product.  I found the correct product, and it is now $200 higher than my original.  So I bought their product, it broke, I had to pay over $200 to ship it back to get them to fix it.  They didn't have to do anything because of UPS and they want me to buy the same product for a higher price.  I would end up with the same product along with spending $400 more and they would make 2 sales where they should have made only one and fixed that broken product under warranty.  Turned out great for them, sucked for me.  That's the last sale they will ever get from me."

So I called the inverter store when I saw where it was going by tracking number. Customer service told me they would file for a change of destination with Fedex corporate. I continued to watch the tracking and still no change. I got a call from Fedex hub near me to verify because it was comming via semi truck so location was important, we live in the smoky mountains! I explained where it was supposed to go and they understood but the Inverter store must make the change but stayed in contact with me. I called the inverter store once again and explained to them it was not changed and I have the number and email for the Fedex hub where it is going. The inverter store told me they can't do that and will only refile with Fedex corprate (not very nice about it!) for a address change (which did not work the first time!). So I had to call the hub and arrange to leave work meet the driver in route because only the shipper can officially change the address. Seems to me they only cared about getting the sale and did not care about what happens to a 4000 shipment once its paid for. I build several home energy systems a year for folks with tiny houses and thought I would try them out. As of now I will not use them again so that is probably 10k worth of equipment I will purchase from someone else. Customer service is very important and was sorely lacking. Just my experience."

I installed the inverter in an application where I had previously been running a 1800W Xantrex modified sine wave inverter.The new, supposedly more powerful inverter, is unable to run my 1000w microwave oven (Emerson MW9113SS 1000 W Countertop Microwave Oven.  1000W O/P with 1450W I/P) which the Xantex 1800W modified sinewave inverter ran without issue.This is not an installation problem.  I am a certified Systems Engineering Technician.  I'm using 0/2 cables over about 8ft from my yacht's house batteries.  The inverter is being amply supplied.  It is simply not able to deliver what it is rated to.  I am now stuck with functionality well below where I was before I attempted to upgrade.  This has been a very disappointing experience."

For that alone they should be commended."

It has been a week and I've not heard back from them.  The rack was $31 and I feel for that amount I should get more than a triangle and some screws.

          "Contenu": "02/28/19The replacement unit arrived yesterday a day before the scheduled delivery date which was very nice. The unit appeared to be a new one despite the fact that I originally ordered a used unit. Thank you for that.I installed the unit last night and it appears to be functional. We will see if there is enough sun today to see it work from my control automatically.The Inverter Store did contact me to say they were addressing the packing issue and the fact that I got no answer about getting a schematic so I could repair my unit so that is an improvement. They appear to be addressing the issues that they can and I thank them for that.I am now going to set about getting my original unit repaired so I will have a spare. I will call the manufacturer and if that is not successful I will set about repairing it on my own.02/25/19The experience started with my nearly 4 year old inverter quitting. That was OK but when I called to ask how I send it back to be repaired I was told they only repair their inverter chargers. Since the charger part of that doesn't charge to a high enough voltage for my batteries so I can never own one of those. Requests for schematics so I can fix it myself were met with Silence.I decided to purchase one of their used ones to keep me going until I could figure out how to fix my failed one. The used one arrived missing the AC terminal strip screws and with a bent mounting bracket and two of the screws broken off because the packing allowed the inverter to move in the box. They had me send it back and told me when they got confirmation that it was picked up they would ship out a replacement. We will see what that looks like when it gets here.A little cooperation would help here. I have been without a working unit for several weeks now while I deal with this."

BUT! Your customer service rep on the Inverter Store telephone has been one of the rudest and most unhelpful on your payroll.  I hate to even call her, she could really use some tact, she has none.  I couldn't even give you her name, because even when I ask for her name it isn't given. I have pushed for her name I think it is Christine? But not sure, I don't know maybe she could answer the phone with cheer in her voice and \"Oh by the way this is (whatever is her name) HOW can I help you!  But no, it is like pulling teeth with the attitude one gets from your customer help line. She really needs an attitude adjustment.Christen Devine-Gonzales"

I am very much in favor of such durability in a throwaway world."

          "Contenu": "The shipment came quickly after being ordered.  All the contents were as promised.  The PV Combiner box door was easier to open and close with the locks than the first one.  However like the first PV Combiner box installing the negative output lead wire into place had difficulty clenching the wire as I turned the screw.  I had to insert the wire and try tightening it about fifteen times before finally I felt the screw holding the wire in place.  I cannot see the bottom of that insert without taking the box apart and have no idea what prevents the screw from finding and tightening down on the stripped wire end?  Maybe the third box will be different?  Otherwise all products worked well.PS. The panels are extremely even as my charge controllers tell me the input and output of both the first set and second set of panels I ordered are nearly identical.  Wonderful!"

I bought two new 2000w deep cycle marine batteries for the front of my Jayco trailer and that was a good purchase for the system.  I do not know anything about electricity so I had my mechanic install it along with installing two outlets, front and back of trailer. It took him about 6 hours to do it all, inverter, new batteries, switch and outlets.  He thought it was a very good system.  Happy adventuring!"

It puts out exactly what the house does, 122 volt. It is very accurate, with seemingly no noticeable variation in voltage. That may be important running a laptop, a modem and a router as in sensitive electronics. Where we live in se Texas, we experience an occasional power outage. Not looking to power the refrigerator, only small electronics such as computer equipment and charging phones and charging flashlights. Also run a few led lights. At 95 degrees in the garage, never once did the fan come on, meaning the whole operation is quiet, just like I like it.Kept it running all night, computer equipment with clamp lights and all, all night and it only took the battery down 15% in 12 hours running.Very low insufficiency at 10%I have a 2200-watt generator (inverter), but that is too much work for a 12 to 24 hours outage. It\u2019s also too noisy, we have full house generators in our neighborhood, and they are way too loud.The 300-watt inverter is perfect for small things, and I don\u2019t have to start the generator and mess with fuel for a 48-hour outage.Very handy, solid and easy to use.Single AC receptacle \u2013 USB PortAlso works great in the car, remember not to draw more than 180 watts when plugged into the cigarette lighter.The price includes two sets of wires.Enclosed DC battery connectionsConvenient cigarettes plug & alligator clips (To protect the vehicles wiring, the vehicles cigarette lighter adapter can only handle 180 watts, if you are going to use more than 180 watts you must wire inverter to battery)Continuous output power: 300 WattSurge power capability (peak power): 600 WattDC input / operating voltage: 10 to 15 VOutput voltage: 120 VOutput voltage regulation: +/- 3%Output wave form: pure sine waveOutput frequency: 60 Hz +/- 2HzDC amps: 25AC amps: 2.5Battery low voltage alarm: 10.5 +/- 0.5 VBattery low voltage shutdown: 10.0 +/- 0.5 VNo load power consumption: < 0.7 DC ampsFull load efficiency: 90%1/3 load efficiency: 95%No load minimum operating temperature: -15 degrees CelsiusFull load maximum operating temperature: 55 degrees Celsius (automatic shutdown)AC Output Socket Type: Type 2 -3 prongHigh input voltage protection: 15VLow input voltage shutdown: 10VProduct size (D x W x H): 7.25\u2033 x 4.75\u2033 x 2.125\u2033"
