          "Contenu": "Bought a system from Eufy, which included a video doorbell, two external cameras and a HomeBase 3 unit to record and control the cameras. My main complaint is the battery life is nothing like the 6 months advertised. For example if my video doorbell is set to 'Balance Surveillance' the battery life is about 7 days. The video shows an example of the home owner using the doorbell and app to confront a shady person looking at their home. This could not happen if the doorbell is set to 'Optimal Battery Life'. Therefore if you need your doorbell for surveillance the only option is to hard wire the doorbell."

After a few similar experiences, I can say that Eufy cameras seem to not capture the motions consistently. It\u2019s motion capturing is a hit and miss by a lot.

I went to reread their refund policy on their website in which that under \u201c30-Day Money-Back Guarantee for Any Reason\u201d it never mentions anything about paying for returns. Only more paragraphs down under \u201cWarranty Claims for Quality-Related Issues\u201d is it found. As a consumer, if I\u2019m not looking for warranty related things, why would I read that?

But, No voucher/code arrived.Tried Eufy online help - but just got an automated response system that was useless, irrelevant, unhelpful, circular and extremely irritating.  Gave up for a while. Tried various other angles for getting through to a (dare i suggest) person. Not much use from the Eufy website.  However, Google came up with a contact number... but not before I was assailed by Eufy automated sales calls and emails.  Yuk!The person i spoke to sounded like they through i was a thief!  the underlying feeling presented was, 'we are right, you must be wrong'.    I get the feeling that this is a technology company with little or no understanding of people!After repeating the facts several times I was told 'we'll investigate,... and get back to you.  Sub text, 'we'll get back to you if we can't prove you're wrong'.  I asked and was told it would take 1 to 2 days to investigate... and and email arrived promsing, 'A specialist from our support team will contact you within 1-2 business days to help you resolve the issue.'  That was 9 days ago and .... and I'm still waiting to hear from Eufy But an email voucher has arrived with no explanation as to how it can be used.. Click the link and it takes you to a page showing the camera system I planned to buy... but now they have increased the price by \u00a3200 above than the previous price. ... And, there is no click-through to purchase the item.  HOPELESS.  Incompetent.However, this email was only sent to me after the Eufy marketing system sent an email with USD prices.. which are 40% lower than the UK Black Friday prices... and 80% lower than the price they are now showing for UK buyers.Are Eufy incompetent, confused or dishonest?"

Unfortunately when I tried to view the front of house there was an initial glitch with a notice to say that camera wasn't working. Thankfully when I re-tried the camera started to work. That is a bit worrying - does it mean it would have remained inactive until I updated it?

Fine, these things happen. What's really disappointing is the support.

Perhaps one of the most annoying things is that after 2 years the glass camera lens cover on the doorbell just drops out - after googling this I found that lots of people have had the same issue generally after 2 years of ownership - for an external item which purports to be weather proof, it\u2019s not fit for purpose.

Video quality is decent, and exterior build quality is good, but the rest is far below both billing and reasonable expectation:1. We're in a quiet rural area, with optimal battery life enabled. We get - at best - a month between charges on each camera2. Motion detection is arbitrary - works when it feels like it and sulks the rest of the time.3. Homekit integration is incredibly slow4. Range is shockingly poor - both of our cameras are within 7m of the base station, yet frequently drop out of coverage5. Support is poor: we raised the issue of one of the cameras not taking a charge properly when we'd had them less than two months - Eufy support did not offer a solution. It's now got to the stage where that camera is unusable, but now of course they just say that it's beyond the warranty period, shrug their shoulders and ignore the issue.On the basis of our experience, we will not be buying any more Eufy products and - even if our experience with the actual cameras was atypical, their failure to support their product is probably universal.

It was difficult to connect to it via the app.It seems to clean the same area over and over again and ignore some easily accessible areas. It gets stuck under the sofa so I can't leave it unattended without moving a lot of furniture to block access. It doesn't always follow the pattern it is supposed to of going up and down the room, it spins round and seems confused. It loses power when left switched on on the charger. The brushes look as if they would need replacing frequently.  And the dog doesn't like it. I am sorry I bought it. It might be suutable for a house with small rooms, not much furniture and no pets."

          "Contenu": "Purchased the EufyCam2Pro camera bundle and initially very pleased with the product. Then 1.5 years later one of the cameras becomes defective. Attempted all the suggested troubleshooting ideas, but the device wouldn\u2019t switch on at all. Completely dead. Approached Eufy to seek replacement but told as outside 12 month warranty by 5-6 months, they couldn\u2019t do anything for me. I had paid for the more expensive product to reduce recharge amounts. The camera had only been charged twice from new. Kept getting rebuffed by Eufy for a repair or replacement camera and escalated complaint explaining rights under Consumer Rights Act 2015, that products require to last a reasonable amount of time regardless of warranty. Eufy admitted the product was defective and hadn\u2019t lasted a reasonable time, however still wouldn\u2019t repair or replace the camera as out of warranty. After many emails Eufy finally offered a 30% off voucher for me to purchase a new add-on camera. Overall I\u2019ve been very disappointed in Eufy\u2019s customer service regarding their defective product, and they have blankly rejected consumer rights legislation. Products are only good as long as they don\u2019t break or fail. The company on the other hand have left a very poor experience."

          "Contenu": "I purchased the Eufy Video doorbell over other known brands considering they provide local video storage.  Initial installation went through Ok without major issues. However the battery of the video doorbell went dried within 3 months.  When I put the doorbell on recharge, the battery won't charge at all.  I tried multiple troubleshooting guidelines but without any success.  I contacted the customer support a couple of times during this period.  They asked me to perform a few steps.  However later on I was told that they will need to replace the doorbell as nothing was working.  They offered me either a replacement or a 70% refund of the original cost.  I requested for a full refund which was declined as my purchase was just over 90 days before the equipment failed to work.  Obviously this was a manufacturing defect, and I had purchased this product only a couple months ago I asked for a full refund which the agent said they will try.  I returned the equipment in its original condition as per instructions by Eufy.  However after a couple of days of returning the product I was informed that they will be unable to provide me with full refund and only 70% amount will be returned.   This is particularly annoying after their initial commitment on 15/06 that I will be provided with a FULL REFUND once I returned the parcel.  I am very unhappy with this service as I would have expected Eufy to give me a full refund considering its a mfg defect.  I am left with a bit of disappointment due to this experience."

So this product is not much use in most parts of Canada and some colder US states.Eufy say the Floodlight Camera 2K has \u201cpowerful built-in AI\u201d but it can\u2019t distinguish the difference between a real moving object and shadows caused by sunlight - this causes near-constant alerts, which also fills up your storage with useless recordings (even when set to the lowest sensitivity). So not much use if you have trees on your property and it\u2019s a sunny day with a light wind.I reached out to Eufy to express my disappointment and this is what they suggested\u2026Eufy say: Set the detection type to \u201cHuman Only\u201d instead of \u201cAll Motion\u201dProblem this creates is that we are no longer alerted to vehicles entering our property, or bears rummaging through our bins, or other wildlife that could pose a danger I.e. wolves/coyotes. Also, it doesn\u2019t always identify a human as a human, which is troubling. It also does not fix the problem.Eufy say: change the defined \u201cActivity Zone\u201dThis would largely defeat the intended purpose of buying the Floodlight Camera 2K.I tried submitting a review of my experience on the Eufy website (twice) but neither were published. There are currently 71 reviews for this product and curiously every review is rated 5 stars, my review was less than 5 stars and I suspect dark forces are preventing you from hearing about the experience of real life customers. I asked Eufy why it was that my review was not published and this is what their customer support manager said\u2026 \u201cFor the review, you could check if you have set the filter to 5 stars only, change it to all review will be ok, we would not have any operation on that\u201d Clear as mud right?In summary then\u2026 for a premium $300 Floodlight Camera it fails to deliver on the most important features and the customer support provided to date has been underwhelming. I would recommend that you avoid this product until they refine the firmware or consider other options."

Their promise to allow bulk backup NOT honoured.Like a fool I  have just  bought a Homebase 3 unit, fitted SSD to allow IN THEORY years of footage to be stored.  I question everything at the moment, so contacted customer care.Customer support today advised that irrespective of what I did ALL recordings are deleted after 30 days....and \"sorry that our technology does not meet your needs\".  What a farce.  Misinformation and misselling concerns officially raised.The agent could not explain HOW data is automatically deleted from an unconnected Homebase 2 when NOT connected to the Internet.  I was just going to store and leave Homebase 2 with it's data.  With Homebase 3, stated same.  ALL date after 30 days will be deleted off the SSD.    How?  Why?  I sent this email and voice recordings.  Will update as I progress.  I believe the agent did not know what he was talking about.   If he is correct, then Eufy will have major issues to contend with.Email content sent today:HelloTotally unacceptable response following my call to your customer helpline today.Your agent specifically told me that on Homebase 2 that ALL RECORDINGS will be deleted AFTER 30 fay's irrespective of the SSD space availability.    Additionally I explained that it WOULD NOT BE CONNECTED, just retained should I meed to access recorded data.  He advised that after 30 days ALL DATA would be deleted.This cannot be the case.On HOMEBASE 3 I was advised that even though I have a hard drive fitted, that AFTER 30 days, data would be deleted automatically.  This must be incorrect.I understand that on both systems, that once the SDD OR HD is full, then the EARLIEST recordings will ne deleted....but NOT ALL just because it is the 30th day I have tried to reason with your agent, but he says I am wrong and SORRY the technology does not meet my needs.Please investigate and provide written documentation of technical details to support.  I am concerned your marketing information misrepresents.  Your agent says one cannot SAVE years of data if required.I am reserving my right to return Homebase 3 on the basis of misselling, UNLESS your agent is as I expect providing erroneous advice."

          "Contenu": "I had 4 cameras and bought a wireless doorbell specifically to work with Alexa as we have 5 echo's and wanted to use them to ring all throughout the house. I bought the unit in June but didn't install/use until Oct, as had new door fitted and did the doorbell at the same time. This worked for 9 months and then stopped! I do not know exactly when, now only homebase rings (and isn't heard throughout the house). Having spent months trying to get some sense out of Cust Support even to get them to understand what the problem was (simple Alexa doesn't ring any more!). After months of explaining and re-explaining (and escalation) I talked to a specific support manager. Who tried to understand the problem - SIMPLE ALEXA DOESN'T RING! He finally told me (about 5 months after I first raised a ticket) that there had been a bug introduced by EUFY that stopped the homebase talking to Alexa, and it may/not ever be fixed. As soon as he knew I had bought the unit over 12 months ago. He simply stated tough! So I paid well over \u00a3120 for a doorbell that worked for 9 months - and EUUFY don't give a monkeys!Thanks a lot"

          "Contenu": "Subject: Complaint Regarding Delayed Support for FloodCam on Homebase3 and Homebase2Dear [Customer Service],I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my dissatisfaction and disappointment with the delayed support for the FloodCam feature on both the Homebase3 and Homebase2 devices I have purchased.In early February, I made the decision to purchase a Homebase3 based on the information provided that it would support the FloodCam feature by the end of March. However, to my dismay, the release date was continuously pushed back, leaving me waiting for this promised functionality. Now, I am eagerly hoping that the FloodCam support will indeed be available by the end of August, as initially announced.To provide some context, I encountered a similar situation with the Homebase2 in the past. I was informed by your support team that the FloodCam support was expected to be implemented by the end of 2022. Unfortunately, this support never materialized, leaving me without the features I had been eagerly anticipating.As a customer, it is disheartening to experience these repeated delays and unfulfilled promises. I invested in these products based on the assurances provided by your company, and it is frustrating to see these commitments not being met. This situation has caused inconvenience and has led me to question the reliability of your product development and release schedules.I kindly request that you provide me with an update on the status of the FloodCam support for both the Homebase3 and Homebase2 devices. Additionally, I would appreciate a transparent explanation as to why these features have been consistently delayed or not delivered as promised.Moreover, I would like to express my hope that this situation will be resolved promptly and that the announced support for the FloodCam on the Homebase3 by the end of August will be honored. It is crucial for customers like myself to have confidence in the products we purchase and the reliability of the information provided by your company.Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response and a satisfactory resolution.Yours sincerely,T. Neumann"

Wouldn't recommend this company as they do not want to help consumers beyond the basic limited warranty. Even with proof of faulty product."

Plus there is no booster available. So being able to connect 16 cameras is great but if you have a house big enough to need 16 cameras, ots too big for the signal to reach.Second, the camera quality is excellent, but the pir only triggers for close movement. So being able to see the boundary clearly is one thing, but an intruder can hop over and wander around without triggering a camera. More range on the pir please."

C24's in a paper A4 envelope (not padded type, just as well not out in any rain) and their own boxes not surrounded by any protective packaging in their boxes or included in the papers envelope. I thought this strange as rattling around wouldn't be the safest for their longevity I thought. The S220 was at least in a padded envelope but again no protective packing included. The buying process was standard and payment along with updates on progress occurred. Overall pleased just wait and see if the cameras stand up after the shipping process.Update 11/8/23 The camera have been working perfectly  with picture quality of streaming, captured events and notifications really excellent. Was on holiday for a week and felt content leaving the house unattended as had been broken into some years back. I have recommend to others with a brother in law purchasing a number of C24s (hadn't seen the loyalty scheme but never mind) and he has similar praise as much better than an outdoor system he had professionally installed 5 years ago. Really happy and would use Eufy by Anker products again!"

The Robovac X8 hybrid works well as vacuum cleaner with hard floor. The creation of the map via App was also easy and the room cleaning function or spot cleaning and scheduled cleanings are perfect. But we experienced also a lot of negative aspects. The navigation has sometimes a problem with our doorstep between kitchen and floor. We\u2018ve got the same doorstep to all our rooms, but somehow the combination of the doorstep and a corner leads to confusion for the Robovac. Then he gives out an error, that he is blocked. After pressing play a few times (and a few errors) he then manages to get out of the doorway and continues cleaning. Unfortunately the mob function is quite useless, since the mob drys out and only two spots (where the water comes out of the water tank) are further mobbed. This leaves stripes on the floor. Therefore we no longer use the mob.Further, after a week one wheel broke. The support has then send us a spare part, which I installed. Since the first wheel did last only one week, I am curious to see how long the replacement will last."

All of the products I have tick these boxes and feel quality; I have no complaints about how well they work.So, why only three stars then? The last few months have been plagued with a saga getting hold of the S100 light. When I ordered in March, delivery was scheduled for \u2018end of March\u2019, which was perfectly ok. This then slipped to the end of April. To early May. To end of May. To early June. Throughout this period I spoke to a variety of customer service agents who were either unable to help or simply seemed disinterested. A \u2018Stock issue due to high demand\u2019 was quoted as the reason for the delays. Given the \u2018stock issue and high demand\u2019, you can probably imagine my surprise when in early May I, waiting for my existing order, was presented with the S100 being sold on Eufy's Amazon store with next day delivery available. I again raised this with customer service and I was told \u2018it\u2019s a different warehouse\u2019 - which coming from the main supplier felt like a poor excuse. No further assistance, or recompense for the ever-extending delay, offered.On the 1st of June my S100 finally arrived, six days after stock suddenly reappeared on the Eufy site with a \u00a330 off price reduction, which having paid the original amount and been made to wait months, somewhat grated. Again, a lovely product. But come on Eufy\u2026 don\u2019t add insult to injury to existing customers you have kept waiting for months! It lets your products down and earns you poor reviews."

          "Contenu": "Overall pretty good (after the X8 Hybrid I bought an X8 Pro SES), but some things are annoying.Firstly, the mapping. You cannot add a room (or, for that matter, delete one), you have to re-do the entire floor for this. Then, when mapping, the software registers areas which are not part of the room, e.g. space the other side of a glass patio door. Of course the robot is not going there but the map looks silly. It should be pobbible to delete areas from the map. The self-emptying has been capricious. It thinks there is a blockage and refuses to self-empty. I assume it was becasue after the first cleaning there was indeed a lot of pet hair. Hopefully with self-emptying set after each clean, this will not be a problem, but the testing should have highlighted this and probablu the robot should be sent back to self-empty in the same way as it goes back to re-charge mid-job if necessary. The ability to climb over thresholds could be a lot better. On the X8 Hybrid at least it's poor, it cannot negotiate a 3/4 inch (20mm) threshold in the doorway. On the positive side, multi-mapping is good, connection with the app robust, handles stairs well (anti-drop), and the virtual boundary and no-mop area are useful. The X8 Pro does not have \"no-mop\", so one hopes it's clever enough to not mop carpets..."

I would give it 5 stars, but for a few omissions:1) E340 Wireless doorbell - you can't configure a smartphone to open up automatically when the door bell is rung (I'm told this might be solved in the future)2) You cannot connect non-Eufy cameras to the system, so I cannot connect my nestbox cameras.3) E340 wireless doorbell - the angle of the lower camera (for watching the doorstep) is fixed, so it can miss part of the doorstep.But, all-in-all it looks like the best on the market."

That said, I guess any external device can be fairly easily ripped off the wall? A related challenge is if stolen cameras could be sold and re-used and I my understanding is that they could be. This is my reason for 4* instead of 5*."

A proper manual would be useful. It gets a laborious deleting yesterdays videos, I haven\u2019t found a way of deleting a days supply in one go. Customer service gets you in contact with a chatbot that was no help for my problem but I got a human email the next day. The camera seems a bit slow in picking up people approaching the house, possibly due to a restricted range of movement detection. The postman is halfway to the front door before it picks him up. The AI for people recognition is very hit and miss, recognising me and my wife about half the time. It works better with our pet dog. My iPhone has just bleeped that someone is outside but on checking the camera it\u2019s a pigeon!"

System fully up and running now, although some of the APP + AI features still need to be understood. Only question at present is how long the battery charge will hold, as not all cameras get full sunlight.It would help if there was an initial set up guidance to ensure that the wifi signal is strong enough in all chosen locations?"

The app is very good also, changing settings is easy and the setting up was no problem whatsoever it was on my door in 20 mins after fully charging it up. Had the battery life been better l would have given it 5 *\u2019s, but the best you\u2019ll do with it without charging the battery which is easy enough is about 2-3 weeks if your lucky.Still it does the job l wanted it for and charging it is not particularly hard, l don\u2019t know wether this model as the Ai included with it l\u2019m presuming it doesn\u2019t because it pings everytime l go near the door. It also has a setting in which you can turn it off which is handy for when  the kids are running around in the street, and it\u2019s constantly going off but it\u2019s a nosy bleeder and picks almost everything up.All in all a good purchase"

Setting it up was way more difficult than I imagined. Connecting to the router and the bell and the phone did almost get me throwing it across the room but once I got there it was fine. The sensor is quite fine and setting the area of coverage has to be quite good so as not to activate on people simply walking past and cars passing on the street. I set it up on 1 phone and when i tried to share it with the second phone it deleted off the first phone so I will have to try again. I definitely think I will have to buy an extension chime as the ringer is very quiet. The recording quality is great and the fact there is no monthly fee is the reason I chose this bell. Once I am used to it I'm sure I will get better. Would I recommend it ? Yes and already have to family and friends"

All components and apps work really well, except for 1) Flood Cam 2 Pro - intermittently delivers sound only (I.e. \u201cblack\u201d video) or goes totally offline and needs to be hard booted to recover (rarely remote soft restart will work)2) the Cam 2 pro battery charge does not last a full year (more like 8 months, but that\u2019s still very good!)3) streaming to web browser is spotty and unreliable (not important for us as the App works well on iPhone and iPad)Considering the complexity of our set-up and requirements the (multiple residences across two continents), the eufy products and solution are actually quite advanced, reliable and cost effective. It\u2019s also helpful that the cloud storage (not a \u201cmust\u201d to order, as local storage only is optionally available) covers up to 10 cameras, which we fully utilize.Set-up and installation is guided via the app - very straight forward and takes just minutes\u2026 impressive!Technical  support is also very responsive and worked through the issue 1) above with the result they will swap the Flood Cam \u2026 once I can finally get to it at its remote location to dismount and return.Overall I can definitely  recommend eufy ip cams and the surveillance app (except the Flood Cam 2 pro). Nifty package and range of solutions."

So i ordered it, charged the batteries, paired the cameras to homebase and all went smooth incl. a firmware update. I mounted the cameras at a suitable heigth and was happy jiust in time. This solution runs for nearly 2 weeks and I can recommend it due to its quick installation and high quality of video recordings. The intercom feature is also perfect to response to the postman etc. when ringing the doorbell."

It was frustrating so I clicked on the e warranty on the app and requested a replacement.  I had a quick reply and was asked to post the camera and chime back to them and they would then send me a new one and refund my postage.  I was a bit apprehensive about this but I emailed photo of package and the return receipt from the post office. I postage it all back on a Saturday and by the following Friday I had a new replacement camera and chime and my postage had been refunded. I dealt with April from Anker throughout the returns process and her customer service was excellent.  The new one is working fine."
