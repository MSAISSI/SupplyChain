          "Contenu": "Atlys - A luring platform for Hassle Free Visa seekers. You get to know the real deal after you pay the hefty double fees in the name of courier, service fees and what not. Several observations:Courier charges:If you've applied for visa for 2 persons, the passports can be sent in a single courier (as confirmed by their support over call), yet they charge double of the already hefty fees. While applying they will charge you for Bluedart courier fees but when scheduling pickup a different vendor with a different AWB number will visit to collect your passports.Due to discrepancy in AWB, I denied handing over my passports and made multiple attempts to reach Atlys support (wrote multiple emails, requested callback via app, reached out on instagram). I haven't got any help from either of the channels.Then I did some research and got to know that I am not the only one. I also stumbled upon this review page and noticed people with similar complain. I also noticed some positive reviews but can easily make out with the robotic names that those have been posted with a bot or someone has been paid to post positive reviews.Nevertheless, it could be a scam or it could be just a pathetic service, I am glad that I was not able to handover the passports to them because after all this I certainly cannot rely on Atlys for even getting my passports back, let alone the visa.If Atlys is indeed a genuine platform (just with poor support and operations), they would refund the fees. If I don't get a refund, it would be clear that it is a scam to fund an unethical and poorly designed start-up. One of the founders' name is Mohak Nahta (found on LinkedIn).All the fellow victims of poor service from Atlys, I suggest that a mass section lawsuit be filed against such fraudsters. If not, atleast file an FIR against them in your nearest police station."

At this point, I had to expect this, they said 'no. we don't have a refund policy'. So basically the promised date and everything else on their website is bogus because there's a lovely *Terms & conditions apply clause.

          "Contenu": "I regret to share my deeply disappointing experience with Atlys Visa Processing Company, which has proven to be one of the worst services I have encountered. This company has exhibited practices that, in my opinion, raise serious concerns about its legitimacy.I initiated the process for my Malaysia visa at the end of October through Atlys. Despite successfully uploading all required documents, including my passport and tickets, and receiving initial verification and acceptance from the application, my experience quickly turned into a frustrating ordeal.Shortly after the initial processing period began, just days before the promised visa approval date, I was inexplicably asked to resubmit my passport, resulting in a 4-day extension of the approval timeline. Subsequent to this extension, I faced a severe lack of communication and follow-up from the Atlys team, prompting me to repeatedly raise tickets to seek clarification on the status of my application.To exacerbate the situation, I was informed belatedly that my visa interview had been scheduled in Chennai, a city far from my location in Hyderabad. Shockingly, the email notification regarding the interview arrived a full 2 hours after the scheduled interview time. Despite persistent efforts on my part to resolve this issue, the customer service provided was abysmal. A particular individual I reached out to assured me that my interview could be rescheduled in Hyderabad but failed to follow through on multiple occasions.As my travel date approached, and despite my pleas for expedited processing, I received an unexpected email stating that my visa had been rejected, without providing any reason for the denial. Numerous attempts to obtain an explanation were met with silence, irrelevant responses, and a general lack of responsiveness from Atlys. Even a promised callback from a representative named Arushi resulted in further frustration, as she failed to address my concerns after I provided the requested information.In conclusion, based on my harrowing experience with Atlys Visa Processing Company, I strongly advise against utilizing their services for any visa processing needs. The lack of transparency, ineffective communication, and failure to adhere to promised timelines raise serious doubts about the integrity of this company. Save yourself the stress and potential complications; opt for a more reputable and reliable visa processing service."

When i filled my pre-arrival application for Hong Kong it was rejected.

An honest company will refund your money if the issue was they could not provide the service offered if there was a problem on their end.DO NOT USE THIS APP OR THEIR COMPANY..you will regret it.. unfortunately...is a scam!!!"

Decision: NOT RECOMMENDED. USE TRADITIONAL TRAVEL AGENCY SERVICES DETAILED CASE: It was my first time (and last time) to use Atlys. I wanted to issue a tourist visa to Dubai. One of the fastest and easiest visas to get. I already traveled to Dubai more than 5 times and I was resident in Sweden for for 4 years. Atlys did not got me the visa for Dubai. I hoped that this was the end of the story. I could not get another visa to Dubai after Atlys apologized for not getting the visa because simply they was holding my application while Dubai relevant authority rejected to issue another visa while Atlys application is still open. I contacted Atlys customer service everyday for more than one week in order to withdraw my application. Every time they reply very late and they state that they already refunded me the money (only 90% of my money). The customer service is horrible and unreliable. They don\u2019t have an option to withdraw your application and they don\u2019t have responsive customer service system. Simply, they are careless about your time and your schedule. All my plans to travel was vanished in no time. If you are from a developing country, I don\u2019t recommend their service because simply you will not be able to recover your intangible resources like time and effort."

We had requested for 4 evisa to travel to Egypt from India for my parent and younger sister, and were promised that after payment confirmation and document collection, the visas would be provided to us within a week.Unfortunately, we were informed that only 2 visas were approved and 2 were declined. Despite this, we requested that the approved visas be provided to us so that my mother and sister could still travel. However, we never received the approved visas as promised.We also requested authorized documentation for the rejection of the other two visa requests for me and my father so that we could understand the reasons for the rejection. However, our requests were ignored and we were not provided with any explanation for the visa rejections.Furthermore, we were deeply disappointed and frustrated by your refusal to refund our payment. We did not receive the services that we paid for, and as a result, we lost all of our money.I believe that your company should respect the time and money of your customers and should fulfill your promises. Unfortunately, your lack of transparency and failure to provide us with the services we paid for has left us feeling cheated and disappointed.I urge you to take immediate action to rectify this situation and provide us with either the approved visas or a full refund of our payment. Your company should also work to ensure that this type of situation does not happen to other customers in the future.Thank you for your attention to this matter.Sincerely,Customer"

          "Contenu": "I was having trouble paying on the Vietnam e-visa site (they did not accept my card, not sure why) so I decided to use Atlys.  They advertised themselves on their website as a wonderful alternative for those having payment issues with the official website. Note that this was 8 business days (1.5 weeks) before my trip to Vietnam, so I anticipated no issues given the 3 business day estimate provided by Atlys.And my payment did go through immediately - but that is where the good experience stopped. The ETA for the visa was originally 3 business days kept getting pushed back and back and then eventually became completely blank.  I reached out to the Atlys representative to help clarify  when I could expect my visa -  they were no help at all, just telling me it was in process and I should wait.Realizing that I could not rely on Atlys, I applied for the visa myself using a friend's card.  I am glad I did so as the visa came in a timely fashion, allowing me to go on my trip.  When the visa from the official website came, Atlys still had no visa or ETA, so I requested a refund. Atlys refused to provide any refund since my visa was \"submitted and in process\". I am so glad I applied for my visa on my own, because Atlys did not get back to me with my Vietnam visa until several days into my trip to Vietnam.  If I had relied on Atlys I would have had to cancel my trip.  Atlys' processing time was approximately 2 weeks at a cost of $49, compared to their initial estimate of 3 business days and the time it took when applying manually for only $25 (1 business day to get a response requesting a higher-quality image, then 3 business days to get the visa).I would not recommend Atlys - they are not a reliable way to get a visa to a country like Vietnam.  Instead they will take your money and refuse to provide a visa by the start of the trip or a refund, leading to a lot of stress and headache.  The ETAs they provide are not meaningful.EDIT: The reply from Atlys is also incorrect.  They claim the visa was \"issued a week before your travel date\". This is incorrect.  My flight to Vietnam was scheduled for May 19th, which I clearly communicated when requesting the visa.  I had  numerous nonrefundable flights, tours, etc. planned immediately after that date.  The visa they provided shows a \"valid from\" date of May 22nd, which is when it was approved (visas are not allowed to extend into the past). So it was in fact AFTER my date of travel to Vietnam, not before.   On a side note, Atlys promised several times to email me when my visa was ready, which they never did (making it more difficult to nail down a precise date and time when my visa became ready).  The only notification was a push notification in the app."

          "Contenu": "On the face of it, Atlys is a superb app, with a wizard AI to guide you through the VISA process required for many countries. The problem is the app never echos back to you what VISA form fields your answers were used to fill in. The Wizard asked for a Departure Date and that date was used to fill in \"Date of arrival in India\". (I have multiple flights, multiple countries.) I never saw the values I submitted until the VISA was approved days later. Therefore neither the user [nor the software apparently]  can catch a date error. In the worst case, like mine, my VISA was approved with the wrong entry dates, an error I would certainly have caught had I been able to see how my input values were interpreted by the app.The VISA approved actually expired before I arrived in India. So big deal, you say, cancel the VISA and reapply? For India at least, you cannot cancel a current active VISA (easily, if at all).  That may pose travel problems for you as a person cannot re-apply for an Indian E-VISA until 10 days before the current (for my case, useless) VISA expires. At that time I will be in a primitive portion of the world without electricity. Result: I am having to pay someone to file my VISA information on time for me, even while I paid for a VISA I cannot use."

They've provided a lot of detail on Malaysian visas for first-time visitors than any other platforms as far as I know. Hence, I applied through them. Their website was easy to use. They promised 8 / 9 days processing time and they delivered on time. The great part is that you can communicate regarding all your queries, issues, status follow-up, etc. through their WhatsApp number, they are great at responding to them, which will give you a lot of peace. I recommend Altys."

          "Contenu": "Applied in the Android app for a friend (from Colombia). Visa was under review for several days. Still not sent to the Egyptian Authorities?  Then I discovered their Zendesk help site There was a message (which for some reason did not arrive to my e-mail) that since I already had started a application on the official website they could not proceed before this was gone (after 7 days without submitting the application). Monday 30 of january it was gone. I sent a message to Rex at Atlys support about that. Today, thursday 2. feb I got the visa. The visa looks the same as the one I got directely from the officila website. So yes, this service is legit and working just fine, although there's still some work to optimize the app to avoid this problem. To summarize: if you already started an application on the official website and there's an applicant there. Then Atlys can't proceed before this applicant is gone. I feel Atlys should tell about that when applying trough the app"
