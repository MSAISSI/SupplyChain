After a lot of back and forth I got my hard drive back. I was able to recover over 90% of my photos with some free software!"

          "Contenu": "So, I sent an old 1.5TB Western Digital external hard drive from about 10yrs ago to see how much it would be to recover the information.  Older attempts were way outside my price range, but was told the information was recoverable.  I learned quite a bit about hard dives in an attempt to possibly recover it my self.  I knew it would take some new basic parts and a clean room.  Access to a clean room is what I did not have.  I did purchase a working hard drive that was same model, and with in a month or so of manufacturing date and lot number for good working parts.  I had already  written the hard drive off due to age but there was some sentimental stuff I would have liked to retrieve.  The hard drive died due to a power surge from 220v lines in Iraq after an attack on our base. Apparently telling the company that the information is important gives it a good story and therefor to them makes it more valuable.  At first great communication with Adam and he was really, confident about the outcome.  Of course, always with the caveat they can't guarantee. Of course after they received both Hard drives, the original and the parts drive the immediately performed a base diagnostic and said they would need to order parts because the extra drive I sent was bad too. Should have been my red flag.  Well, the non-refundable/non-guarantee price for parts and labor at $1384.35 was cheaper than the 2,500 quoted 10 years ago for a guaranteed recovery, still more than the $400 they base on their site and over the initial on the phone.  I reluctantly paid cause I was hopefully for a good outcome and get back photos/video from wedding, deployment and basically anything from before I was 25.  Thats when it all went down hill.  I waiting through the week with no word, looking forward to an email or phone call with some kind of update or progress as they had done to quickly get me a quote.  After a week or so I decided to call Adam and left a message.  He called back relatively quickly with bad news. He claimed to be reading notes from engineers, and that after replacing pretty much the entire hard drive they were unable to get any information from it and it was unrecoverable.  At first, I was kind of surprised due to the positive attitude toward a success before but then immediately shocked when there was a rush to destroy the hard drive instead of sending it back to me.  As he has highlighted specifically the value to me.  So here I am with no data, loss of $1300+ and waiting to receive my hard drives.  I will perform an inspection when I get them back as I recorded the serial numbers of the internal components to see of anything was actually replaced, as I paid for the parts I should receive the parts. If they were not, I will be notifying the FBI for fraud and filling fraud against my credit card and the BBB. The reason I have gone down this route are the quickness to get quote and payment, no contact once payment received, touting success with little caveat, suddenly parts that were good are now damaged beyond repair, and the quickness to destroy instead of returning the drive.  Thank you for listening. No company should take payment before service performed, always ends in fraud."

          "Contenu": "Beware of any place that does not provide pricing up front. I don\u2019t think this business is a scam, but they are scammers. After a conversation with one of their reps where he questioned me about what data I hoped to recover I sent them 4 drives. The level of communication and helpfulness dropped steeply once they had my drives. They never replied to emails and I had to chase them to get the results of their recovery efforts (they lost my number). In the end, the drive that had what the rep knew I was looking for was not the oldest drive I sent, not the largest, not the drive with the most files, but it was, just coincidentally, the most expensive to recover. Initially I said yes and gave my credit card info, but after reading the \u201cno guarantees, no refunds\u201d contract on which they had put an incorrect (and much higher) charge price, I decided not to sign, not to proceed with the recovery and asked for my drive to be returned. It has been nearly two weeks now and they have not responded, not returned my drive and not returned my money. So if you\u2019re going to use them, just beware. And be vague. Don\u2019t tell them what you\u2019re looking for, because I do believe this company can do what they say they can do, but where they could choose to be honest and genuinely helpful, they choose to be greedy and to gouge."

          "Contenu": "The process seemed pretty straight forward and similar to other data recovery companies. Ship them the drive and they will work to recover it. Almost immediately after filling out a form on their site on June 21st 2022 I received a call from [REDACTED] asking if I'd received the shipping label. I asked a few questions about shipping and recovery which she was happy to answer so I shipped the drive, what could possibly go wrong, they promised to return with shipping paid in the unlikely event they were unable to recover the data.Three days later I received an email and a phone call from [REDACTED] where he said parts would be required to repair the drive which would cost a non-refundable upfront fee of $1,425 and an additional fee of $60 once the recovery was completed. This seemed steep so I asked for a few days to think it over, in the meantime I did some research and given the parts / labor required it seemed like a costly, but not altogether absurd amount.On June 29th 2022 I receive an email from [REDACTED] who's signature reads \"Head of EU & US Sales Fields Data Recovery\" with no reference to previous estimates he informed me that the cost was variable, based on urgency:Standard turnaround 3-4 weeks --  $960Expedited turnaround 1-2 weeks -- $1300Emergency turnaround 2-4 days -- $1620upfront payment, non-refundable and an additional $89 would be due after recovery. He called me shortly after sending the email to ask if I had any questions, answering them with what now seems like a rehearsed spiel about how technician labor is costly, parts are costly and there are no guarantees in this business, I was duped.After paying I tried reaching out by phone and email to all three and received no answer from any of them. Over 2 weeks later I received my device from UPS in the exact same state as I sent it, nothing has been changed or replaced on it. Given that nothing whatsoever was done on the device makes it quite clear that this is a scam, they take your money, hold the device for a few days and then ship it back as if nothing happened."

          "Contenu": "I truly believe this is an indiscriminate scam. I\u2019ll try to make a long story short, the details are important. The lone survivor of my immediate family was murdered and I contacted several companies in my effort to distinguish who would be the most honest and capable, obviously I failed this time. When I first contacted Field Data Recovery they were not as business-like, on the second contact and after explaining the facts of my living and dire financial situation of no income etc., that this was my last hope in finding the killer and recovering precious files and pictures (but didn\u2019t have the pass code) to the devices, they seemed sympathetic. They told me that the lost passcode would not be a problem and asked what I wanted to retrieve. I told them and continued speaking with other reputable companies, who had money back guarantees, and when I thought I had found the right company,  contacted Fields and informed them out of courtesy. The subsequent conversation seemed very heartfelt and it was explained to me that they hoped I would find someone reputable and gave points to consider in finding the right company. This conversation really touched my heart and I decided to go with Fields. All the money that I had in the world to pursue this, keep myself alive and a roof over my head, was paid to Fields. Bad, bad decision! They couldn\u2019t even get past the passcode and it took some creative communication to even get that much of an answer. I have been devastated over this loss and sent a message to the owner/supervisor, the response from (The person who took over the contact) was a phone call and he simply said, \u201cWe\u2019re not returning your money. We priced it at a very low rate.\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe $1500 was the least expensive that they could go, it\u2019s still unbelievable to me that they resorted to such a statement when I hadn\u2019t asked for my money back but instead wanted change in their system so that this didn\u2019t happen to people in the future. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the money would be exceptionally welcome and needed, I just did not want this to happen to anyone else. It took over two weeks and a couple inquiries to get a response about the results, although I was initially told it would only be a few days. They did receive my package the day after I sent it, I didn\u2019t get it back until another two weeks after my supposed result. The thing I am not 100% positive about is whether or not they actually did anything because both devices were still on the same timeframe for the pass code as I had left them. I am going to contact reputable companies and inquire about all of these practices/results. I\u2019m obviously disappointed in myself for buying into their sales pitch and going with a company, pretty much the only company without a moneyback guarantee. However, what they told me from the beginning was obviously a falsehood.With the response I received, the service etc. I\u2019m completely baffled that they\u2019re still in business, that sort of practice is unacceptable from where I stand: unprofessional and dishonest. I\u2019m considering legal action and have been told it\u2019s an easy win. Please be careful and protect yourself so it doesn\u2019t happen to you."

That means you might get a file list of recoverable data prior to being hit with a bill 50% of the time. Their marketing should read that 50% of cases require further diagnostics that start at $495. This was my experience. Now I'm waiting to receive my drive back to send it to the manufacturer for a recovery."

When I did receive an email it was to ask for a password on a device that was at least four years old, so I wasn't able to get it right the first time. I didn't receive another email for another week to ask for another possible password. When I emailed to complain I was essentially taunted by my representative. Insulting customers is not the way to do business. When I called the New York office to submit a formal complaint I was channeled back to my bad mannered representative.

They said that if it were unrecoverable I\u2019d just lose that $200. After finding out that I\u2019d have to pay for the \u201cfree\u201d diagnostic I asked them to return my hard drive. After 3 days I sent them an email asking for the tracking number and they didn't answer my email. Later I called them and asked them if they had sent my hard drive back and they said no. I asked again if they could send it back to me and the guy said I\u2019d have to wait about 2 weeks because they send all hard drives back in bulk so I\u2019d have to wait until they had more to return. Then I asked him if it was possible to send it that day or the next and he said I\u2019d have to pay $35 for express shipping. Final conclusion: They are scam company with little knowledge on hard drive recovery. I don't recommend them. They just want to get your money and after they will either say an expensive amount for recovery or that it\u2019s unrecoverable."

Once I finally got a meaningful response, it was an email with pictures of the drive taken apart, a vague description (PDF report) of what was done to the drive, and a \"Sorry, we couldn't do anything\".Following this, I asked for some sort of refund on good faith. In their agreement, there is a line stating that they can refund partial or whole amounts at their discretion. I thought since they did not actually do anything for me, this would be no problem at least getting something back (I was willing to take the new hard drive they would have sent with my recovered data and be ok). That was not the case. After being instructed to fill out a \"formal complaint\", I was told I would have a response in 5-14 business days. Nearly three weeks later, I emailed the person who sent me the link to the \"formal request\" for an update. 5 days later, I finally received a response. The response essentially said \"We did what we were obligated to do\". No hope of any good faith with customers there."

Two months ago I had one of the worst things happen. A failed hard drive. One that contained my entire music collection and photos from the past 15 years. All gone. I searched the web for data recovery services and happened to do the online estimate at Field Data Recovery. I was called by them later in the day about sending in my drive and I would know within 24-48 hours if they could retrieve my files from the drive. I never heard from them. I called and was told they were close and I should hear something within 24-48 hours from them. Still I never heard back from them. I figured they were working on it and gave them a week and called back. Once again they had no details and I was told I would hear from them in 24-48 hours. Never heard from them. I let another week pass and called again. I got the exact same response as I got the first two times. Yet again after the 24-48 I heard nothing. I gave them another week and called again. This time the person in charge of my drive was unavailable (in a meeting). The person answering the phones kept interrupting and cutting me off (I guess she did not want to hear me complain as I am sure they get a lot of that, but seriously how rude). I finally was able to ask to speak with a manager and he came on the phone, apologized, told me a little more about the condition of the drive and then once again told me I would hear something from them in 24-48 (it has been 24 hours and I don't believe that I will hear back from them tomorrow). Everything I have read about this company is telling me that they pull this crap and keep your files hostage so you pay exorbitant prices once they finally get back to you. Don't listen to them when they say 24-48 hours, as this is apparently 4 plus weeks for these guys. I have no confidence in this company to live up to any of their promises made on their site or on the phone. With the way they treated me and handled my case I would never, ever recommend that anyone use their services. Period. Go somewhere else.UPDATE: They are trying to have this review removed even though their own site points to these reviews. Try running an honest company showing honest reviews like this one. Apparently the UK and US are indeed the same company that is now trying to pull this crap off in Europe and Asia. The TrustPilot reviews on their website and facebook pages are false. Beware. After being jerked around for over a month I finally hear back and they are asking for $820. Not happening. I can't afford it and even if I could I would NOT give them any money with the way they treated me. I have asked to have my drive returned to me. But after reading more reviews (not associated with their bogus TrustPilot account) I feel I will never get the drive back either. Stay away from these people in all countries. Google them if you don't believe me. Wish I had done more research before trusting in TrustPilot and going down this road."

          "Contenu": "Hands down the worst possible service I could ever expect. My hard drive had a busted drive-head on a hard drive I stored research data on. When I first asked Fields for a turn-around time on a repair job for that, I was told it would take a week for my device to be looked at, repaired, and returned to me. I was also asked to source a blank identical drive for parts, if I could. I did. First things first: Every attempt to contact them by email failed to get a response until I'd sent at least three emails over the course of a week. Never did they respond sooner than a week after I'd sent an email. Every attempt to contact them by phone got me the run-around on hold until I was told a supervisor/manager would call me back. That never happened. Fields didn't get back to me with anything solid for three weeks, despite repeated attempts to contact them after a week had past. When they finally did, I was told they hadn't looked at it yet. Yet more weeks later, they finally got to it. Apparently. They said they couldn't use my spare drive and had to source their own, wanted me to pay for that. Then they gave me a file list which contained all of the folder but less than 1% of the files. Which should not have happened, because a busted drive-head doesn't cause significant drive damage. I don't know what they did to it, but they messed something up in a big way. There was still a tiny amount of data listed as retrieved though, so I grit my teeth and paid them to get the drive back. The drive, when returned yet more weeks later (10 weeks in total), despite repeated questions of \"where is the drive you told me you were sending back?\" When it finally arrived, it came with a USB drive which had my minuscule amount of retrieved data and no spare hard drive. Which I had explicitly and specifically asked in (at first ignored, but eventually responded to) emails if it would be returned to me. The USB had my folders, but as it turns out most of the \"retrieved\" files were corrupted and I couldn't get any data off of it. The returned 'repaired' drive was broken beyond repair and couldn't be reused. And the spare drive is still missing in action, presumably lost or just taken and not returned by Fields. At every step of the way communication was awful, nonexistent, and I was repeatedly lied to. And I know it may seem like I'm really upsetabout this and ... well that's because I am. I'm normally really accommodating about delays, problems, etc. from service companies. I've worked in the service industry myself, I get it. But this was outright malignantly bad service. There's no excuse for it. Oh and at one point when asking for a pay form I hadn't been given for the third time that week, I was sent a 'pay form' ... which was a .png of someone else's file tree. So add general incompetence to the list. If Fields actually did the work they promised and didn't just straight up remove and scan the hard drive outside a clean room (which I wouldn't rule out, it'd be consistent with the damage done), they're the worst data recovery service I've ever heard of. Never use them."

          "Contenu": "I contacted Fields Data Recovery regarding a laptop that had failed and used eMMC chip memory instead of a standard hard drive.  They were informed in both email and conversation that the issue was that the power supply on the mother board had failed and the computer used not a hard drive but eMMC chip memory.  The service I requested was a recovery of the files from the eMMC chip.  Fields assured me this was not a problem, that they did this all the time, and that such services start at, and usually cost $199.  They also stated that I would get a list of the files that could be recovered, and there would be no charge if no successful.  I shipped the unit to Fields and several days after shipping, contacted them as I had not heard from them.  After two phone conversations I received a call with a message from their engineers asking if we had removed the hard drive prior to shipping.   I explained again that there was no hard drive, it was an eMMC memory chip.I then got a call from them stating that the unit required a completely different procedure, that it was not at the right office for such a procedure (called a chip off) and that the procedure would cost $960 dollars, the bulk of which was payable in advance, was non refundable, and that there was no guarantee of success.Thus, I came to the following conclusions-\tThe personnel answering the phone had either ignored my statements about the eMMC chip storage or were ignorant as to what it was.  If they were ignorant, then they should have escalated the case to someone who understood.-\tThe engineers who worked on my computer ignored the case file notes.-\tThe engineers who worked on my computer could not recognize an eMMC storage system (note these are supposed to be top talent computer storage personnel).I also received a letter from them that did not accurately represent the issues, but rather said that the drive (again, no drive) needed to be sent to the R&D division, have parts procured and replaced, be put in a clean room, etc. etc. etc. none of which is part of the chip off procedure, or what I had been told on the phone.I asked for the laptop to be sent back to me, at which point I was told it would cost $60, and that there was no less expensive option.  This is at odds with their letter to me where they acknowledged that it was a laptop I was sending, and stated specifically that offered a free USPS return option should I not want to go forward.  When I paid the $60 the person who took my money could not tell me when the unit would ship.  When I did get my tracking number I found that it was shipped via UPS ground (despite being told in email that I would receive it that day \u2013 overnight) which at full retail cost was $11.04 (I am sure that as a large customer they have a substantial discount).  So it would appear that the rest of the money was a \u201cfee\u201d for them looking at the laptop, figuring out that it was what I told them, and telling me it would cost almost a $1000.00.   When we received the laptop back we found it had been packed in a random box, 10 times the size of the laptop, with a single layer of bubble wrap and no other packing so basically the laptop was loose in the box (note, it had been shipped in a padded, packed box made for laptops).  Additionally all the screws that were removed to open the unit had not been replaced.I have attempted to complain to Fields about some of these issues but their response has been to ignore my comments and rather attempt to place all blame on me for simply being unhappy with the price.  I am unhappy with the price.  I am more unhappy that I was mislead, that I feel this is bait and switch, that despite being given proper information it was ignored, that the letter to authorize work presented a false list, that I feel I was charged for it being examined, that I was told it was express shipping and it was not, that it was so poorly packed for return and the poor poor level of customer service.I would judge the practices of this company to be exceptionally deceptive.  Their strategy is to get the hardware and then convince you of the need to pay them.  And then when you say no and complain, they become hostile and uncooperative."

          "Titre": "The $400 \"Replacement Parts\" Requirement",
          "Contenu": "I was badly mislead by this company when they required $400 for repair parts before they could proceed with the job.  After sending them the money, I received an email that was exactly the same as another Trustpilot reviewer (26 Auyeung) received (see below).  Coincidence?  I don't think so.  I then sent the unit to DriverSavers, Inc. and they recovered all of the data.  Because DriverSavers was able to recover the data, and did so without ordering \"replacement parts\", I don't think that Fields Data Recovery actually did an evaluation of my drive or even order any parts.  They made an easy $400, and they don't deserve even 1 star.Text of Email from Fields Data Recovery below: The data recovery laboratory received your hard drive and it was determined necessary to purchase parts to complete a head swap to attempt the recovery of your data. Using the newly sourced parts, our technicians performed diagnostic, repair and retrieval procedures on the disk in an attempt to recover the data and copy it to your chosen media. Unfortunately these processes were unsuccessful in recovering any data from your hard drive. Diagnostics The hard disk drive was disassembled in an ISO-4 standard clean air room so that its internal components could be individually tested. The electronics PCB board, (which is responsible for all communication between the computer and the mechanical parts of the disk), was isolated and tested for damage to the fuse, transistors/capacitors, circuitry and interface and all were found to be in working order. The disk was connected to an analysis machine and the ROM/firmware (a table of instructions found on the disk which allow computers to interpret the disks signals properly) was directly accessed and found to be in working order. The magnetic plates (platters) were isolated and examined for signs of irreparable damage and none could be seen on the accessible sides of the platters. The read/write heads (which span the magnetic platters and read the data) were isolated and examined where damage to the arm and magnetic reader was revealed; furthermore when power was supplied to the disk the read/write head(s) were found not to be positioned within the correct alignment. However, additional tests on the motor (the component responsible for spinning the platters) found it to be in working order. Repairs  The damage to read/write heads was most probably caused by the misaligned positioning of the head assembly when the hard drive was not powered. In addition to this small pieces of dirt and dust were detected on the individual reader heads. The actuator arm and read/write heads were chemically cleaned and re-examined to maximize the chance of re-alignment. The arm was then mechanically altered to prevent further alignment problems and the read/write heads were re-assembled on to the disk. Unfortunately, subsequent diagnostics confirmed that the repairs made were unsuccessful.An identical hard disk was sourced and subsequently ordered and used for spare parts in order to attempt the recovery of your data. The read/write heads were completely removed from the newly ordered disk and were examined to ensure they were in working order. This second set of read/write heads were then assembled into the original disk replacing the existing malfunctioned heads and carefully aligned. Diagnostics confirmed that this procedure was also unsuccessful. Further analysis of the medias platter surface revealed inconsistencies of the magnetic properties which could potentially be linked to the contact made between the head and platter surface resulting from the initial \u2018head crash\u2019. This may have been caused by one of several factors ranging from environmental impacts (e.g. a drop or bang) up to temperature expansion of certain components. Due to this preventative damage caused we were unable to initialise the heads long enough for a forensic scan to take place before further damage was caused to the replacement read/write heads.Conclusion: No recovery possible.Unfortunately, as we are unable to help with your data recovery needs at present, there is no further action that can be made."

          "Titre": "BEWARE: Do you research first!",
          "Contenu": "They somehow have great reviews listed on their website, but you should check other review sources for the truth. Here's my experience own experience:Synopsis:  I accidentally sent them a working external hard drive instead of a broken one, and they quoted me $940 to \"fix\" it. Then after the headache that followed, they finally returned it to me... in multiple pieces. Details: I had a hard drive that had dropped onto the floor, and wasn't reading in my computer. I had a second identical drive as a backup, but I had lazily forgotten to back it up since the start of 2017. I currently live overseas, and was quoted $1500usd for data recovery in Hong Kong for my broken drive. I thought I would check for a better rate while I was home in the US in early April. I contacted Fields Data Recovery by phone and explained the situation. The sales person was (of course) extremely pleasant and helpful. He said that he was confident they could do the recovery for cheaper, starting as low as $400, and that they could get the replacement drive back to me within two weeks (before I returned to Hong Kong). There would be a free diagnosis, followed by a price quote, and then I would decide whether to move forward with data recovery for that price. That was fairly identical to my experience with the Hong Kong company.I sent it in same-day, and quickly received email confirmation of the drive's delivery. Soon after that, I was provide with some vague diagnostic about firmware and a price for retrieval of $940.The first thing I thought was that diagnosis description was very vague and not much like the one I had received from the Hong Kong company. Second, the price seemed a bit higher than the sales call had led me to believe, but cheaper than the Hong Kong quote, and I thought maybe that was on purpose, and I shouldn't have told them what I was quoted originally, but that's business.Then I reviewed the list of recovered files, and I immediately realized that I had sent them the wrong hard drive -- it had all of the files up through 2016 but nothing after. I quickly called my husband to test the other drive and he confirmed what I thought: instead of the broken one, I had accidentally sent in the working (backup) hard drive. This was my mistake. But in making this mistake, I realized that they were willing to charge me almost $1000 to \"fix\" a working hard drive. It made me wonder if they do this to other people, who might not realize they are being grossly overcharged.What followed turned into a bit of a nightmare. I immediately contacted my Account Manager, and explained that I had sent in the wrong drive, that the drive they had was in fine working order, and I needed that drive returned. I asked him to please let me know if there would be any issues returning the drive before my departure date.He replied that it would take a few weeks to get the drive into my hands. (This was different then what I was told originally). After that, he became very non-responsive, unhelpful, and dismissive. At one point, he offered to do the data recovery for $400 instead of $940. I declined, reminding him that the drive they had worked fine, so there was no need for recovery services, and I asked him to confirm that I would receive the drive in the same condition it arrived in (which is what I experienced with the Hong Kong company). It ended up being two months, a few dozen emails and more than a few headaches before the drives were finally delivered to a family member in the US. When the package was opened, the \"working\" hard drive I sent them on mistake was in multiple pieces. This is when I found all of the horror stories online -- not only from the US but from their \"branches\" in the UK, Germany, and more. I should have researched the company better, and I probably would have under usual circumstances. I was lucky, in a way, because I didn't lose any money, but now I have one broken hard drive, another possibly broken one, and a decade's worth of precious data, memories, photos and work possibly lost forever. I'm surprise that a company like this exists in America today, and I hope this review will keep someone from being hurt by it."

          "Titre": "The Missouri Attorney General should shut Fields DOWN!!!",
          "Contenu": "To better grasp the severity of the Fields Data Recovery SCAM, it is important to remember that this document was composed on Wednesday, August 9, 2017. I will be very specific with the dates of my communication with Fields Data Recovery so that you will better understand the outrageous arrogance of their sales representatives. The reason I am composing a thoroughly detailed report of this exchange is to assure you that I am not a crank who looks to smear companies because I\u2019ve got too much time on my hands. I am 56 years old and have no desire to ruin an innocent employee's life. I've been there. What I have included is the absolute truth, and you should regard any 5-star review for Fields to be suspect. If Fields is so wonderful, why do so many people have the same experience I had? Google \"Fields Data Recovery Scam\" and see what comes up!In my initial contact with Fields, I was assured they were \u201cthe second largest data recovery firm in the U.S.\u201d I am assured I am dealing with a group of complete professionals.To cut right to the chase before I get into details, on Wednesday, April 19, 2017, I mailed to Field\u2019s the hard drive from my PC that had crashed the previous October along with a brand new Toshiba Canvio Basics 1T external hard drive I had purchased for $55 on Amazon for the recovered data. The data on my crashed HD represents over four years of work I had done on my PC. Additionally, I paid $400 for the recovered data I never received after a period of over SIXTEEN WEEKS!! I consider everything to be lost, will report the $400 as an act of fraud to my issuing bank, and will be reporting Field\u2019s to the Attorney General in Missouri. I kept all email communication in a folder on my PC, so every single word quoted is 100% accurate. If they try to sue me, I\u2019ll bring it all to court!Timeline and Text of CommunicationTuesday, April 18\tI received an email from Fields containing the text below and two .pdf documents (one a UPS shipping label, and the other a form I had to fill out identifying my hard drive and the specifics of what I wanted done). I carefully packaged my materials wrapped in bubble wrap and shipped it the next day, April 19. The email was an introduction to Fields and what they do. Note the following:As discussed, we can offer you a free diagnostic which would mean getting a report on any faults - usually within 24 hours, an online file list of any recoverable files and a fixed price quote. You don't have to accept the quote and if you don't then I would be able to arrange to send your Media back to you (we have a free USPS option).Wednesday, April 19\t\tI received the following email, along with two .pdf documents (one the Fields Terms & Conditions Agreement, and the other their policy about returning crashed hard drives). Here is the substance of the email:Re: Data Recovery - Job Number 727905I would like to take this opportunity to welcome you to Fields Data Recovery. We are pleased that you have chosen to use us to help you with your data recovery needs. We can confirm that we have received your hard drive and it has already been entered for a diagnostic analysis. The exact service level will have been agreed with your account manager who is at hand to help you if you have any concerns.Tuesday, April 25\tI received the following email from Fields:Hi Kevin,We have recently finished backing up your data. We are happy to say the recovery was very successful. We were able to work through bad sectors, head swap and slow responding problem which was resolved. The price to get your data back to you will cost $1,230. We do have a same day discount, which would bring your total $1115 (Same day discount is for individuals who purchase their data the same day its recovered). Contact me when your get a chance. Thank you!!I sent the following email:While I am very pleased to learn my data is recoverable, I am electing to have my hard drives returned without the data backed up, per your \"no obligation quote.\" The data simply is not worth the quoted price of $1,230. Thank you for your help in this.That same day I received another email, stating that a local recovery service would be willing to perform the recovery for $960. Again, I declined, as my initial research into data recovery services uncovered numerous services at estimates of $300 to $500.A few hours after I declined the second estimate and requested the return of my two hard drives, I received an email:No problem Kevin.Now, here\u2019s where things start to reveal the SCAM that is Fields Recovery!Wednesday, May 10\t\tFifteen days after Fields agrees to return my two hard drives, he sends me this email:Kevin, I want to apologize for our shipping department not getting your device out to you yet. For the inconvenience, we can get you your data back to you for $400. We plan on getting it back to you very soon. Feel free to touch base with me when you get a moment. Again, I apologize for the delay.  Okay, we\u2019ve gone from $1,230 down to $400 just to apologize for the two-week delay at their shipping department! Remember, there are no data recovery outfits that assure you of a set price before they take your hard drive (there is no way they can promise a successful recovery until they know what caused the HD failure). So once they recover the data, all the work is done. If you don\u2019t accept their price, that means all their work is for nothing. Anyway, I was delighted with the significant reduction, and since $400 is well within my budget, I accept the offerFriday, May 12\tI telephone Fields and pay $400 with my credit card.Wednesday, May 24\t\tFields sends me an update on my order:Good Kevin,It appears that there was an update this morning by shipping by you are in line your shipment. As I write this, it is Wednesday, August 9, seventy-seven days after my account manager notifies me that my order is being prepared to ship. SEVENTY-SEVEN DAYS!!!Friday, June 23\tIt is now thirty-nine days since I was told the shipping department was on the cusp of sending my order. Nobody in the shipping department responds to my communications. Frankly, I am livid. I telephone Fields and told him in no uncertain terms if I don\u2019t have my order delivered in the next seven days, I\u2019m going to savage Fields Data Recovery like a bad case of HIV on every social media platform I can find. Once I make that statement, I hung up the phone. I am finished listening to the lies of my \"account manager.\"I have been completely civil and professional in all my communications with Fields Data Recovery, but I am at my wit\u2019s end. It is clear that my assurance of an imminent shipment was a lie, and for all I know, no data recovery was ever performed.Two hours after I make that phone call, my acct manager copies me on an email to the shipping department:Please get his original back. He says he is going to bash us on social media if he does not receive it by next week.He then sends me the following:Kevin,I took $400 dollars for data recovery. As I am not in the shipping department, or have anything to do with them. It personally isn't my fault he didn't send your original back to you, but I understand that you are upset that you need it back. I don't think trying to stirring things up with me is going to do you any good, because I am the one hounding shipping for not getting out to you.This is the last communication between myself and Fields. Please note the utterly tone-deaf statement this guy makes.\u201cI don't think trying to stirring things up with me is going to do you any good, because I am the one hounding shipping for not getting out to you.\u201dYeah, you\u2019ve been a priceless help in that department! You\u2019re entrusted to act as sales rep for the company, but some chimpanzee high school dropout in the shipping department still has a job with \u201cthe second largest data recovery firm in the U.S.\u201d CONCLUSIONAnd there are the facts of my experience with Fields. I can swear in court to the 100% accuracy of what I have written. I hold no hope whatsoever that I will ever see my data or hard drives ever again. But if I can put a dent in Field\u2019s business stream, I fully intend to. If anyone reading this needs data recovery, for the love of God, DON\u2019T GO TO FIELDS!I now have no fewer than three cloud auto-backup services (Evernote, Dropbox and Microsoft OneDrive). If my hard drive crashes again, I will NOT go through this ever again!Update 8/11/17: After sending this excoriation of Fields Data Recovery to social media AND reporting the transaction to my bank, I receive an email from UPS: You have a package en route to you from Fields Data Recovery.This is the HELL you need endure when dealing with Fields Data Recovery! CHOOSE WISELY!"

During the same conversation they estimated a cost of \u00a3200 then two days later they phoned me to inform that the recovery would have been more than \u00a3800 but in the email with final assessment it was \u00a3595. I thought it was still exorbitant and the amount fluctuating so much felt dishonest so I asked to send the hard drive back by DHL to the same office where I delivered it; it took 3 days to arrive even if the courier travels daily. I had to trace the delivery all day and when I went to collect the hard drive the USB cable was missing, not even an \"I am sorry\". I wasted 10 days, haven't solved the problem only accumulated tiredness and stress."

When the drive was returned to me I reached out to Fields Data Recovery and sent them my drive. There was a period of some confusion because I thought I was working with a different tech who I had spoken to on the phone. They explained exactly what was needed to recover data and in response to my concern about the cost reduced their fee. It still is an expensive lesson--always have a backup to avoid having to use their services. Eventually, I received a thumb drive with my recovered files. Unfortunately, not all files were recovered. They did not promise they would be able to restore 100% of the drive but I believe they did their best. Of the two companies I contacted, I would use Fields Data Recovery again, if needed. My only regret is that I didn't have a backup of the external drive and to get files I didn't want to lose I had to use their service. I would have rated them a four or five if I hadn't had the confusion at the beginning and if I had received 100% of my files, but some of that was out of their control and mine."

          "Contenu": "Fields Data Recovery has a lot of bad press out there. I sent my hard drive to them before I read any of it. My hard drive was an external hard drive that was knocked off a desk and three feet onto the floor. Basically, the disk was still in one piece but the head was knocked off, (and I was later told damaged, which I can never truly confirm given my lack of knowledge on these things). Once they got my drive it was a game of un-kept deadlines. First it was 48 hours, which turned into next week, which turned into the next Monday. I think it took a good 10 days to get a price quote and a report on how much of the data they could recover.  They would be able to recover 95% of my data and it would cost me $850. I paid it. Then I took another two weeks to get the disks back from them. There was various excuses. I was promised it would ship this day and it never would. Finally when it did ship, I was promised a tracking number. I think I finally got the tracking number the day before or the day that the disks arrived. \r Its hard to say if they really got 95% of my data back. The disk was full of photos. I noticed some missing photos but I also noticed a lot of double and triple of the same photo. So while they may have gotten 95% of the data volume, I am not 100% sure they got 95% of the files. If that makes sense. \r So overall, they did the job they said they would do, not in the time frame they promised. From my more tech savy friends, the price was a good price. I got most of my photos back and that is what I wanted. If I ever get in this situation again, I will likely shop around a little more to see what else it out there. Not saying I would not use them but I would definitely take more time to compare."

          "Contenu": "I was very impressed with the service and process to get my drive there.  I had a centralized home NAS that was 2GB fail.  I had a little less than 200 MB of data that needed to be recovered, mostly pictures of my girls that were not backed up anywhere else.  I received an initial estimate that I thought was acceptable.  I sent my drive out and found that I had 95% data integrity with no physical damage.  However, the quote to restore the data went up dramatically (about 150%). I couldn't justify the quote that was higher than the professional services from Seagate.  I requested the drive be sent back to me so I could figure out an alternative solution or save up the money.  A week later after I expected the drive to arrive I received a phone call asking about restoring the data to a drive I would provide near in the middle of the original quote.  I did approve the restore.I initially explained that I understand they are providing a service and for the most part a good service with great updates.  However, I felt that there was a severe injustice with the large price hike.  I understand they have time, software, hardware, etc. invested to provide this service and that the initial quote/estimate is just that, an estimate.  However, with no physical damage and a high percentage of data integrity I was very disappointed with the high quoted price. I felt like a hostage and was very disappointed not only in how this went down, but that I had data I desperately wanted.  When they called back I agreed to the reduced price and asked why the reduction.  The rep said that his manager wanted to earn my business and recoup some of their cost.  It felt very much like they tried to get as much as possible from me then settled for a reasonable amount.  Again, I was willing to pay an appropriate fee, but I felt that I had been taken advantage of.All in all, the process was great with many updates and quality work.  However, when it comes to quotes and cost, be cautious.  Or wait and they might end up reducing the cost.  Again, if it was a business need and the data critical to operations I have no doubt it would be worth it.  However, with my circumstances cost was a factor and we eventually got to an appropriate level, but not the best experience."

We found the price a bit steep--$800 rather than the $199 in the ads, but they were willing to work on a private and non-corporate issue.  We had quotes of $2000 just to diagnose the problem from more corporately oriented companies.  We sent in our hardware and we got the diagnostic and results as promised.  However communication was not all it could be--results could only be viewed with Chrome browser or Safari--and that was not specified.  Once we knew this, we could see from their report that the data we were interested in was recovered, and we happily gave them our credit card.  But we were not informed that by paying with a credit card we would incur a overseas transaction fee because the charge was by a British bank, so $25.00 was added to the $819 quoted which we were not expecting.  Had we known this  we might have chosen another kind of payment.  We gave them authority to charge our card on 1/14/2014, but we did not receive our data.  We called the recovery specialist using a cell phone he was not familiar with he answered and told us that his office had had a hard drive failure of their own.  Once again he promised to send the data.  When we got our credit card statement without any e-mail that the data had been shipped, we disputed the charge.  The next day, we had an e-mail that the data had been shipped, and 4 days later we got the DVD with the data.  We then un-disputed the charge.  On the whole, our experience was positive with regard to performance, unsatisfactory with regard to communication, and OK with regard to cost.  The specialist tried to blame delays on our only having given him a PO Box, but we were never asked for a physical address.  We had asked to have the data shipped with tracking info but this was not done.  Finally the data arrived by USPS priority mail about 2 days after we were told to expect it.  All our mail comes to a PO Box.  Even the UPS drivers occasionally drop packages off at the post office for our PO Box.  On the whole, our experience was positive with regard to performance, unsatisfactory with regard to communication, and OK with regard to cost.   The company delivered on its promises finally, and possibly under pressure.  They could work on their communication with customers would be our main criticism, but on the whole we would recommend them."

This kind of fixes are expensive \u2013 the final quote came back higher than site description, but it was still much more reasonable than the other companies charge. I ended up paying $1K+ for my hard drive repair.

They gave me an estimate on the repair price and told me that if I then wanted to go through with the data recovery afterwards, that will cost more based on man power, and if they are successful in retrieving the data the price would be more. The man on the phone asked me if I wished to proceed and I decided it best not to. With that, my device was soon shipped back with no charge and in the same condition I had sent it, with the rubber case and charger along with my device. Even through I decided not to go through with the repairs, the whole process had been easy and smooth. The man I spoke to on the phone, John I believe, was very kind and informative. The shipping was free. My item came back in the same good condition I sent it along with it's accessories.

Seeing a banner that says (very clearly) \"Fix any drive for $199.99\" and then to be given a price of $500 for the data recovery... it almost feels like (and I am not inclining it is so, just saying it FELT LIKE) the data had already been recovered, and I was negotiating a ransom for my data. To have to talk to 3 people and lose almost a day, it just seemed very awkward. If there is any reason for me to question a business relation with your company it was that situation. But still overall very satisfied. got the data for a price that it was worth."

At her urging, I sent in my dead disk drive and they immediately lost track of it.  Eventually they hooked me up with an account rep who had a little better idea of what they do, but still acted clueless most of the time.  He was able to track down my disk and get the techs started on recovering the data (after about 2 weeks of me waiting.)  In the end the data recovery worked great but the cost was much higher than I expected, $425 for 20GB of data.  I had been lead to believe that $199 was a reasonable expectation, and now I see that there are many shops that will do it for $99."

I chose the local company first because I was hesitant to send my hard drive through the mail. I was gutted that they were unsuccessful. I almost threw out my hard drive!!Soon after, I got a follow up email from Fields to see if I still needed help. After receiving clear, friendly, and efficient communication, I decided to give it another shot since they provided a free shipping label via email to get my hard drive out to them. Also, they offer a free evaluation. Nothing to lose!Julian, the account manager, was the nicest - I appreciate great customer service and he truly provided that. He kept me informed every step of the way via phone calls, emails, and voicemail messages.Anywhere you go, data recovery is expensive. I see a lot of people in the reviews complaining about the price. Fields ended up being less expensive than the place that was unsuccessful.I like that Fields will send you a link where you can look at all the data they can recover before you decide to purchase.Julian told me I would get my data back in 3-4 weeks after I told him time wasn't an issue. But I ended up receiving a hard drive w my data the same week he told me the good news that they could recover my data. He told me on a Monday and I received my recovered data on Friday!I would definitely recommend using this company. I couldn't have had a better experience. It's such a hard thing to lose important files. Customer service reps need to be compassionate, and that's exactly what I got from Julian and his team."

I had a drive with 40k files crash on me and it was the master backup I had for my business containing everything I needed to run my business this summer. I worked with Aaron who was an absolute pleasure, they kept me updated through the whole process, paid for shipping and even supplied me with a cost free consultation on service. I would give this company a 10/10 every time."

They communicated very well and kept me updated on every step that was being taken and explained it if needed. They called and emailed frequently during the process. Also, I felt like it was all done so quickly, the entire process from start to finish.  I felt like the price was fair, as well. Luckily they were able to retrieve all my files for me (84k+ files). I would definitely use them again, and recommend them for anyone who has had anything crash on them. My drive was unretrievable through several different programs I used and a couple people trying.  I am so thankful to have all my memories back."

After seven days, the Support Team made follow up call to ensure all was well and suggested cloud-based data storage"

          "Contenu": "Everyone at Fields Data Recovery were really quick to respond. Communication was really good. I got updates for every step and the no obligations was very comforting. The baseline cost is the cheapest I found. I was told that most other companies are sending devices to them and can upcharge shipping. I checked a couple other places and I believe that.I ended up with a replacement hard drive. There was some shuffling of data which was anticipated, but all the data I was expecting was there. One warning: if they send you a data list, check it. I ended up with duplicate files and a ton of weird trash files, so that likely increased the price.  I didn't check before hand, and that probably would have saved me a lot of time and money."

If you decide not to takes services, they ship the drive back at no cost which I believe is they're best selling point vs the competition. I really enjoyed the customer service they gave us, explaining every step of the process and following up on the work history. They're data recovery services were very reliable and accurate as all of our data was saved by them like eureka!"
