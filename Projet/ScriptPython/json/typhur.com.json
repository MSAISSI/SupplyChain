Communist chinese made device with app taking all your personal data and shipping it to communist china and the world. NO THANKS TYPHUR. Now go subvert your own phones. Leave ours alone. You should be ashamed of yourselves.SIDENOTE:  Trustpilot removed my initial review citing ILLEGAL OR HARMFUL content.  What a surprise!  Perhaps this communist chinese company influenced Trustpilot.  That is especially dangerous since Denmark has strict privacy laws for its citizens.  I guess Trustpilot does not care about anyone outside Denmark.  NOTED"

Tracking information indicates the package is in Miami since November 28.There was a security issue with my order. My mailing address differed from my indicated network location. I responded to the request to clarify the discrepancy on November 23 via email that I use a VPN service. I also called and left messages after that since I had not heard back from customer service.Customer service is not one of your companies fortes. I have made four attempts to contact customer service without much success using phone and email messages. It was only until yesterday that someone attempted to contact me via a phone call. No one has responded to my original email message requesting a reply."

I received the thermos probe a little while ago.Did not open it right away, as I was traveling.However, I am cooking a roast today, so had a first chance to try it.My problems with it started even before I had a chance to actually use it.Following the instructions, I unscrewed the battery cover, and pooled at the screw, expecting the cover to lift.Instead, the screw came out \u2013 battery cover did not.I tried prying it out with fingers, nail, a tiny screwdriver \u2013 nothing works. The cover stayed on as if glued.I was able to pry it open by using a small pin, but scratched the cover (and my fingers) in the process.I inserted batteries and replaced the cover. The cover fits too tight (so I WILL have more headache when the time comes to change the batteries) \u2013 which on one hand is great, as it prevents moisture getting in, than, you should have designed the screw in such a way, that it cannot be pulled out at all. Even then, it is too difficult to open the cover, using the screw as a handle. This issue may be unique to this particular probe \u2013 that I do not know."

Their failure to actually imagine there is any other use case for this thermometer then cooking a steak show how little you know about your customers.   The case in point is that the thermometer FORCES a rest time. If I want to set my temperature to 150 degrees, why are you stopping it at 142 forcing a resting time. Not everything I cook has a MANDORY rest period.  I\u2019m not saying that the thermometer doesn\u2019t have some nice features, but now I need to compensate for your design teams lack of vision."

I increased my star rating a bit because this all looks to be the fault of the shipper. Free shipping is great and all, but I'd have happily paid to avoid all this.I have no idea who Swiship is. I got no shipping updates then all of a sudden it went from \"Package left seller's premises\" to \"Oh... actually we delivered it two days ago\". I didn't get a package to my letterbox, package delivery area, and the nosy old ladies in my condo complex confirmed no packages had been delivered. Swiship customer support refused to help and forwarded me to Amazon Logistics. Amazon Logistics refused to help and forwarded me to Swiship. Neither would or could provide actual proof of delivery. Guess I'm just out $200. From now on I'll have to ensure I buy from a company that uses FedEx, UPS, USPS, someone reputable."

          "Contenu": "Best digital thermometer I've ever tried! The very first day it arrived, I was cooking a 3 lb \"spoon roast\" on my 3 burner grill. I had tried other digital thermometers, but Typhur's instant temp. intrigued me. All the other digital thermometers basically failed. With the Typhur I liked that it powers by 2 AAA batteries. I don't have to rely on having it USB charged [so many times my previous digital thermometers were not up to the charge leaving me frustrated that I hadn't planned ahead] Here you just make sure you have 2 AAA batteries and you are ready no matter when.  As soon as I popped in the 2 batteries, the extended probe immediately showed me the current air temperature. To turn it off I simply moved the probe alongside the unit. Getting back to my roast. It hadn't been thoroughly defrosted [as we realized], so when I had the grill hot enough, I turned off the middle burner, lower the left and right burners to about 50% [I've learned that I get a pretty steady 375-400\u00b0F heat as I would in an oven.]  The Typhus worked extremely well. After 30 minutes, I usually insert our oven thermometer into the roast. I use it as a rough guide, but when I inserted the Typhur, the read was immediate, and because the roast was still cold in the center, the Typhur read was a lot less than the oven thermometer.  Which one did I trust?  Well, I took off the roast when the oven thermometer reached over 170\u00b0F; the Typhur was a lot less [sorry, I don't recall the actual temp.]. I hadn't trusted the Typhur, but when I took the roast off, let it sit for awhile, and then sliced into it, it was dark red at the end...not good. Fortunately, I hadn't shut down my grill. I put the roast back on and waited for the Typhur to read around 170\u00b0 [we like it to be closer to medium]. It came out perfectly! [note: I did NOT leave the probe in; you are instructed not to; I inserted the probe in the thickest part of the roast for only a brief moment from time to time because the reading on the unit is immediate, not necessary or needed to leave the probe in as in the case for the oven thermometer.  So, my first experience with the Typhur proved to be quick and accurate for me.  Plus, it is magnetic so the unit can conveniently stay near me where I have steel back door next to my grill. [I do take it in after and it stores in my basement on the post of my metal cabinets.]  I plan on purchasing 2 more Typhur thermometers for Christmas presents for our 2 adult daughters."
