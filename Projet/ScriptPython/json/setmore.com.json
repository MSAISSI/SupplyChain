Unprofessional, useless and 3rd grade. Better move to Calendly."

I do not recommend! I will be positing this to as many platforms as possible, i would not want anyone to go through this nightmare. A lot of their reviews are fake and false apparently. Use simplybook.me, honeybook, connecteam, or when I work, way more reliable."

The only point of setmore was that they could see: all products, all time options in the calendar and the drop down for time zones, all on the one page without scrolling.They said it was for accessibility etc. but only 90 year olds need 200 size font on their desktop, but even 90 year olds after this new update, wouldn't find the time zone drop down menu hidden underneath the calendar anyway because they wouldn't know how to scroll.The product solved a problem we were having and then shortly after, essentially removed the function that was assisting us. Don't fix things that aren't broken, the new update broke Setmore. I'm quite upset to wake up to this because I am waiting for the avalanche of client emails asking about time zones when previously this website fixed that issue for us.I miss the old version terribly."

          "Contenu": "This review won't apply to everyone. We used SetMore's booking page as an iframe on our website over the last 6 months. Our business revenue grew by 40 to 50% during this time.After a few months of using SetMore as an iframe on our website we tried building our own custom front end with SetMore's booking API. The switch to a custom front end didn't work out due to the limitations of their API listed below. We then switched to Timekit which has it's own set of issues.I love the customer support on SetMore. They answer right away and solve your issue in a relatively quick manner, but there are a few minor UX bugs that make no sense. Backend Notes (for the SetMore team): - Their API has no way of linking customers and appointments together (shared customer ID) when using the API - You can't export a list of customers from the API with all appointments - When a customer clicks on an appointment and gets to the checkout page the backend registers the booking as confirmed. This makes using a tool like Zapier to send booking confirmations useless because all clients will receive an email right after they reach the checkout page. - There sometimes can be syncing errors between your Google calendar and the SetMore copy of you calendar after you make a lot of changes to your Google calendarUX Notes: - SetMore was updating it's booking page so it looks a lot cleaner and their were bugs during this switch to the new booking page - The customer reporting view is really nice because it distinguishes revenue confirmed as earned (post appointment) vs. pending revenue - The calendar view for each resource you have is awesome. You can view all the appointments for each resource in one place - They make use of several sub tabs which don't directionally make that much sense for a user - There are two places to export your historical appointment data one of which has less data than the other (would recommend consolidating it) - Allow your users to set the booking constraints on a resource level and not on a service level. Ex: John needs a 24hrs notice and Sue needs a 48hrs notice for bookings.  - There aren't that many good analytics (visits by page, etc) in the SetMore admin page. In order to get reporting on your traffic flow through the SetMore booking process you have to use Google analytics to get that.  - I also wish they would allow Hotjar so we could see the users interaction with the booking page. Although we wouldn't be able to change much on the booking page."

But if setmore had more options available to make repeated bookings, this app would be super."

I definitely feel that online chat strives to be helpful but because of the language barrier -it is incredibly time consuming because I often explain things over and over. My last interactions with Siddhartha and Michelle never got rectified and I tried to speak to someone in the US by calling and emailing, no luck. They were very certain they would contact me soon and its been 3 weeks. I can see using a free product can be troubling without US support of any kind, so I think I will jump to something I pay for (and get more service). As a FREE service it is 5 stars, because I spent so much time setting it up and have to bail because I cannot get help, 3 stars."

As a Health Care Provider I would also recommend that you offer online charting for patient files like other programs do. Most clinics are moving in the direction of online record keeping and It would be wonderful if that was all included in your platform. Otherwise keep up the great work!

I would also find it helpful, if you could set a limit to the amount if Apts you would want in a day, and the app would automatically not allow anymore bookings. This would be helpful for people who do physical work, and only want so many Apts in a day without having to babysit the app. Also, when going into the app activities, it always has to be refreshed, the new info doesn't automatically load.

The interface has a learning curve. Also their functions aren't distinct for the two: classes seem an add-on that hasn't had the bugs worked out entirely yet. For example, a private appointment can pay with Paypal, but a class attendee can't. Or another example is that we can't separate the booking window: We'd like a 48-hour blackout period on private appointments but allow class booking up until 1 hour before classes. In the software this isn't separable. On the positive note, uptime is great, we have only had 1 small interruption during a beta test we agreed to participate in, and the support team is very knowledgeable, friendly and accessible, and work with us to answer support questions. Unfortunately often the answer is \"this feature is not available yet.\" Hopefully those are being worked on."

This barrier made it difficult to understand one another as I had to spell the name of my company and spell my email address out 3 or 4 times when the rep was unable to pull my account up using my phone number. Three representatives, multiple transfers, and 30 mins later of missed callbacks later was very frustrating. I felt that things could have been smoother if my phone number automatically prompted my account.Update: Thanks for your reply Julia. The issue has already been resolved. It could have been resolved more quickly and more efficiently if my phone number automatically prompted my account."

          "Contenu": "The software does what it is supposed to, and we're happy with that. Customers are also appreciative that we are online now, too! There are some little things that we've run into that is really holding it back from being top notch in our opinion. 1.) The mini calendar (to select the day) sometimes will glitch and move itself over to the side of the window, hiding half of it which does not allow us to click on a particular day. It does this repeatedly until we select a different 'tab' (like settings) then going back to the calendar - essentially \"resetting\" it. Sometimes it does this multiple times in a row. We are using the desktop app, by the way. 2.) There are some inefficiencies with the flow of booking an appointment. We pick a time and search for a customer; however, if there is no customer found, then what I'd like is the phone number we searched to automatically be copied into the phone number field in the new customer profile (right now it copies it into the 'name' field.) So, we have to cut the phone number from the name field, then paste it into the phone number field manually.3.)  The \"Provide Multiple Services\" feature needs work. We run a nail salon, and it would be really nice to be able to select feature services depending on the first service chosen. For example: if a customer books an acrylic nail appointment, I'd like to only offer/show additional services that compliment it (like a pedicure or a wax.) Instead, all of the salon's services are shown; and I don't think a customer would book two services for their hands when only one is needed. Additionally, not all services are shown, so it seems to be kind of all over the place and random on which ones actually get shown to the customer. We had to sadly turn this feature off. These are kind of minor gripes, but when it comes to a busy salon where customers are coming in and out, and the phone is ringing to book appointments many times per day, these inefficiencies really start to pile up in the mind. Additionally it's much tougher to train employees on the workarounds. Again, the software is complimenting our business well, but it could be improved."

The downside to the free version is the lack of integration with other calendar tools like Outlook.

Positive feedback:Thanks for getting rid of the separate pathway to make slot blockers, so we can use the same button to make any kind of appointment. Suggestions -1) I rarely see the same person twice (niche practice), so it would be nice to be able to bypass entering patient name into Setmore when setting appointment (I put name and phone # into notes).2) My practice is by appointment only, and I only go in some 15-20 hours a week. It would be convenient to be able to set alarms to remind ME to go in to see a patient."

Hema was great (5 stars!) and very patient as the sound didn't work on either end at first and waited for me to take care of my doggies.My only complaint was with the platform itself which, though it has a lot of integrations with other systems, it lacks a lot of functionality that I desire like saving CC info for clients, having a class with recurring sessions for the same customers (like a class that is held on Tuesdays at 1pm for four weeks) that the customers only have to sign up for once, or having multiple reminders at different times (like 1 day for an email, and then a text 1 hour before).Still a good platform. Hopefully they'll add lots more functionality to their own app, rather than spending more time on integrations."

I had noted a few changes to really make the user experience even better ie. for the text reminders, if it can be a 5 digit number instead of a telephone number. My clients dont realize that the text is from an automated system and they respond back to that telephone number. Another example, we received a lot of reviews but it is only available on the setmore platform. We would love to make the reviews visible on yelp and/or google. So once I stopped asking reviews from the clients, this also blocks any potential clients from seeing the existing reviews on setmore. Again, overall very happy but would be happier if consistent improvements were made."

          "Contenu": "I tried the Setmore App after a bit of research on appointment schedulers, as I was about to go into a period of interviewing and working with actors on our upcoming series. The app made the entire process of allowing actors to self-schedule their own appointment times, and then for us to seamlessly hold and record the sessions something easier than a breeze. We remain very happy.The reason for the 4-out-of-5 review is that my one quibble (which is an entirely personal one, but may also apply to others) is the look of the app. It is not visually engaging on either the host or user end, and we are firm believers in visual appeal contributing to user engagement and satisfaction. Better graphics and UI are, in my opinion, called for. If the app looked as good on-screen as it works, I would have sought to find a way to rate it 6-out-of-5 stars."

I like that I can customize appointment types for my students to select. However, the visual calendar blocks do not align well with the time slots and sometimes it's hard to click the correct area to get the time I want. I have to correct it in the drop-down menu.The visual part could be improved to be clearer to the eye. It gets a little frustrating, when I use it so often.Also, it would be nice to have the option to block out certain days instead of having to manually block out sections, or change the availability for all Mondays, or Wednesdays, etc. I understand if that's already a premium option and not the free one, but having more schedule options would be nice."

I use the calendar to schedule software training classes where more than one person attends.  It would be nice to include a place where the creator of the appointment can add participants and send them the invitation when they create the appointment with me.  I cannot use the Webinar feature because I teach sensitive information and cannot allow people to join our meetings outside of the organization I am teaching at that time.

While testing is nearing $120 per test this program lets us spend money where it counts and continue to stay organized and give our student body autonomy to schedule as they see fit. There are a few things we could use that would help as time is a premium in our situation blocking a student from being able to schedule after a few No Call No Shows would help with a pop-up of call the center. Also, the texting option that is not free would be a fantastic asset for a group like us. Overall this program is amazing and I know we plan to continue to use what is available as long as possible."

I was most impressed with the fact that she first asked my reasoning for choosing Setmore.  That allowed her to be able to walk me through the process for using and customizing the program to my specific needs - not generalizations that I had to decipher later.  It took 26 minutes, but by the end of the video call, my business page was up and ready to accept bookings, process payments, and integrate with social media.  As I am just starting my business and being mindful of the fact this was my first experience with online booking programs, it would have taken me at least an hour to do on my own.  Swati made the process so much easier and also demonstrated how easy it will be to customize my Setmore account as my business grows.I had been researching several similar online booking options, but Setmore (and Swati's) customer service far surpasses the other options!  Using Setmore quickly became the only choice for me."
