          "Titre": "Returned Headphones, Company Refuses Refund",
          "Contenu": "I shipped a purchased pair of headphones back to headphones.com using their prepaid label. The label I used was the company\u2019s prepaid label, but now they are refusing to refund me, telling me to contact USPS. I contacted USPS and they said that since they are the merchant, they assume responsibility for items shipped back to their warehouse with their label. I have saved all communication from headphones.com customer support  and forwarded it to my bank. Now I have to proceed with the chargeback, and I am telling all of my clients and family members never to use headphones.com, as they cannot take responsibility for a return that was lost in transit. Which they, as the merchant, must take responsibility for. If your return is lost in transit, headphones.com refuses all refunds. Beware.EDIT: You all need to know how headphones.com treats its paying customers. Not long after I posted this review, a customer service agent sent this email to me: \u201cYes you are responsible for getting a return to us. You have already left false information in your 1-star review of our company along with false information in your first chargeback.We are unable to refund you for a product that has not been received. We have told you what is currently happening with the USPS claim in relation to your return.\u201dThere\u2019s nothing false about what I said in my previous review. I used their label, I shipped the item back to them, and now they are refusing to make things right. Do not purchase from this company."

They advertise free returns on their website, but what they don\u2019t tell you is that they deduct 10% of the cost of the item from your refund if they feel the return is unnecessary (and if it\u2019s damaged due to their fault in shipping, they demand you file a warranty claim first before shipping it back). On top of this, I returned my item (a pair of Focal Bathys headphones) last week and still have not received any indication my item was received or when my refund will be processed. I would avoid this store in the future."

          "Contenu": "I wouldn't say my experience was great, however, the response time from emails was consistent and informative to a point. Let me explain.I signed up for email list at Headphones.com over a year ago. After 7 months of receiving emails, one particular email stood out in a negative fashion. I read it and responded. Had to do with why I hadn't made a purchase. Headphones wanted to cancel or remove me from emails.Moving forward I made a purchase of 2 products on 12-24-22. I received an email on the 25th from Andrew himself thanking me for the purchase and why I chose Headphones.com. I responded, on the 27th I received an email from a staff member claiming they would be happy to help with any issues I have.I find this a little condescending. Andrew if you send a personal email to me then keep the conversation between you and me. Not a staff member. The email you sent should be The staff at Headphones.com would like to thank you for your purchase etc.Now present day. Depending on how the issues I'm having already with both products get handled will determine the final outcome. This an update submitted 2 reviews on items purchased. No response from Headphones.com. I did submit a review to ifi. Far more damaging than what I left on Headphones.com Working on leaving one with Moondrop.I have another update. As I stated earlier how Headphones.com would handle the situation. They failed miserably. I did request to talk with a manager. Taron responded and we got nothing resolved. He did send a return form however Headphones.com wants to charge me for return shipping. I ended the conversation with him and went to the bottom of the totem pole. Headphones.com customer service is lacking in integrity. 1 April asked if I wanted to return items. I said yes and mentioned I would like to upgrade the headphones. I also mentioned the ifi UNO EQ was not working. April didn't bother to ask what was wrong or to give any insight as to why the EQ is not working. I emailed ifi about EQ not working, they sent me some checks to perform. If they didn't resolve the issue then send it back to the vendor. As for the Moondrop Kato's, I wanted to upgrade however April ignored my request and told me they were now closed and that she would extend my concern to the Headphones.com team. I never heard back. I did learn Headphones.com will not post a review if the rating is 3 stars or less."

          "Contenu": "Dear headphones.com,I am writing to express my extreme disappointment and outrage at the treatment I received on your Discord server. As a valued customer of your company, I expected better from the moderation team and customer service.On 12/24/2022, I was banned from your server for simply saying hello to another user. I had no intention of causing any harm or disruption, and was simply trying to be friendly and welcoming. However, an unreasonable moderator saw fit to ban me with no warning or explanation.When I reached out to your customer service for an explanation, I was met with complete silence. Not only was I unfairly banned from the server, but I was also denied any chance to have my voice heard or my side of the story told. This is unacceptable.I have been a loyal customer of your company for years, and I have always had a positive experience with your products and services. However, this incident has completely changed my opinion of your company. Your actions have shown me that you do not value your customers or their experiences on your server.As a result, I will no longer be supporting your company. I will be sure to spread the word about the terrible treatment I received, and I am confident that I am not the only one who will be turning away from your company because of it.Edit now that they have replied: they are now claiming I haven't bought a product in their system for some reason which is either an accounting issue or a blatant attempt to mislead readers. Both ways it further adds reason to distrust this company. They also claim my ban is for some previous offense to a \"rule 2\" which covers things such as bigotry and harassment. Seeing as this doesn't seem to be some sort of \"parody\" or joking response from them, and the fact that I am both very much against racism, sexism or any form of bigotry and have never shown or acted in a manner to suggest this as a reason to ban me, this is a blatant attempt to slander me. I may look into taking action, as that is not only a false attempt to damage my character but to be honest I am mostly just done with the childish behavior of this company. I also had my friend do more research, and the actual reason for my ban was because one of their mods knew me from another server and has been holding some grudge about me selling my Sennheiser hd650 to buy a stax headphone. This isn't exactly inclusive behavior for a community around a company that sells all types of headphones to all types of customers. Why they attempted to slander me instead of fixing the issue or at a bare minimum apologizing is beyond me but I strongly suggest avoiding business with them. To be clear (in case they decide to behave like a proper corporation handling a complaint rather than children), I have no intention of doing business with them in the future no matter the resolution they come up with. This experience has given me too much of a distain for them and I would rather take my business elsewhere. I do however expect an apology and that they delete the slanderous remarks they made and clear things up for future readers seeing these post. It's better to be seen as a bad company than a childish bad company that will go as far as to illegally slander former customers on completely fabricated claims."

          "Contenu": "Their customer service was horrible, constantly giving false promises/expectations, it was bad enough for me to leave this review. I'm a peaceful person and I like to resolve problems with the other party as quietly and smoothly as possible, but they were abysmal. I had to message them for every delay and problem that there was. Not once did they message me first in the 1 month of this whole ordeal. I'm sure other people had positive experiences with them, but I was the unlucky one with the bad experience a really bad experience I might add. To start, my product was out of stock so they informed me after I filled out an email survey on Jan 12th. I purchased the product and selected for expressed shipping which takes 1-2 business days. They told me they'll give me a discount for a lower end model and asked me if I wanted to accept their offer (first impression wise they seemed alright since they were quick to reply and give me a discount for the troubles). I quickly replied and asked for a confirmation of the total price and that I will accept it if they send me a new unused product. They didn't respond back to the email so 2 days later I filled out another form on their website to ask for confirmation of the order. They finally got back to me saying that they are processing the order and they will get back to me regarding the shipping time. I sent back a reply asking what the final price would come out to be and when the price adjustment will be processed (they said they'll discount $500, for my $3799 purchase). Yes, with quick math it'll come out to be $3299, but the lower end model they were sending me sells for $3599 so I wanted to confirm if it was $3299 or $3099. They never replied or sent me any updates. Jan 17, 2020 I had to send them another email which they replied to saying they are shipping my item out and that the refund will be processed by the end of the day (STILL DIDN'T CONFIRM THE FINAL PRICE). The product arrived on the 21st and I had no problems with that. The problem is I still haven't gotten my adjustment credit. I decided I would just wait and give them time since the banks could be slow. I trusted that they did refund me and waited until Jan 24, 2020. I didn't get any adjustment credit so I contacted my bank to see if there were any incoming transactions. They told me there wasn't any and at this point I was just done with them. I filled out their RMA form and asked to return the product because I'm not paying 200 dollars more for a product that is of lesser quality + the horrible customer service I don't want to deal with. They gave me return instructions on the 27th of Jan and I sent it back to them. Oh I wish the problems ended by now. They received my product on January 30th. My refund has still not been processed as of February 12th, 2020 10:02 AM. My patience is running thin and I'm so close to opening a dispute with my bank if the refund doesn't process by the end of this week. I've bought dozens of musical equipment that costs thousands of dollars and this is the first time I ran into such problems. Other companies inform the customer when there is a problem and they give them an ease of mind. They also live up to the promises, but this company is a disaster. Not only do I have to email for every problem or update, but they also break promises.Update: They have refunded me finally, but this whole process was dreadful."

          "Contenu": "I wish there was a way to rate the item, the vendor, and the manufacturer separately. Out of the box, the headphones came with three noticeable cosmetic defects: 1) unfinished/scratched yokes, 2) scratched aluminum frame in the back, and 3) emerging separation on the plastic component on the back of the right earcup, which does not clip back in place.I initially tried to live with them, until, less than two weeks after receiving the product, I decided to report the issues to the manufacturer (HEDD) first and later the vendor (headphones.com). HEDD asked me to send the item to them. They would fix it for no less than $500 or $600, depending on the type of intervention. After weeks of back and forth by email, headphones.com finally concludes:  \"As HEDD was not able to replace the headphones, we would not be able to offer a replacement. As these are cosmetic issues, they would need to be reported when received as there is unfortunately no way to know if they were scratched out of the box or if it occurred from use.\"Wonderful. It was probably my fault for not reporting everything to headphones.com immediately and, for this time, I will simply have to bite the bullet. I spent almost $2,000 for a pair of headphones in such poor manufacturing conditions. I will try to sell the headphones at a heavily discounted price.Customers beware, as headphones.com does not seem to stand behind the quality of the products they sell. I will unlikely do business with them again. I should have purchased from Amazon as I usually do.The HEDDphone sounds amazing, though. It's truly a wonderful piece of technology. Five stars for sure!UPDATE (to reply to headphones.com): My first correspondence with headphones.com was on Feb 19, as correctly stated in their reply below. My first correspondence with the manufacturer (HEDD) was on Feb 7. I mentioned in my review that I first contacted the manufacturer. I mentioned the same in my email exchange with headphones.com. So only six days after receiving the item. I tried with headphones.com only after being quoted so much by the manufacturer for a repair on an item that was supposed to be brand new (on Feb 15). This is explicitly mentioned in my message above, and your customer service knows about it (check my correspondence with them).I stand behind the claim that it is a wonderful product indeed. I gave it 5 stars here and on your website. The one star is for my experience with you, as vendors. The quote of mine that you reported from my email exchange with customer service clearly shows that I noticed these defects with time (what is the deadline to notice a defect anyway? One hour? One day? One week? Sure... I won't make the same mistake next time). In particular, I realized that the yokes of my unit are unfinished/scratched after comparing them with those of a friend who owns the same headphones. The defect might be light (it's not, unfortunately, even if it does not affect the functionalities of the product), but it's not what it is supposed to be. That's HEDD's fault.It's interesting that you could conclude that I placed the headphones on a hard surface (without even mentioning it once in your correspondence with me) by looking at pictures in which the headphones are correctly placed on their stand, or in my hands. I guess this statement is just as questionable as you are questioning the truthfulness of my review, implying that I caused the damages (which I did not). Couldn't the scratch be there already before the item was boxed? What about the separating plastic components on the earcups, which are getting worse every day by just light use? Is an emerging and developing product defect after just two or three weeks included in the price? And the unfinished yokes? Clearly not your fault, but you are the vendor and have unloaded all the risk on your customer.I understand it's my word against yours. I will bite the bullet. Not a biggie in the big scheme of things. You've got my money (I am sure it was not scratched, any defects with my payment?) and also this one-star review. My business will go somewhere else. For my next Audeze LCD-5, I will SURELY use Amazon! I am sorry, but at this price point I expect perfect working AND cosmetic conditions. Two weeks to detect cosmetic issues do not look that much, but that's probably just me. It's a little sad that you are implying I damaged the product. What evidence do you have? There's clearly a reason why Amazon can be trusted so much. I have returned expensive stuff for much less, without a problem. I should know better. Totally my fault.UPDATE 2: You are right, I spent $1499. Not almost $2000. I checked the current price of $1899 a couple of hours ago, could not remember exactly what I spent for the item two months ago. The substance does not change. It's still $1499. Quite a lot."

Otherwise it is cost to much nerves , time and money to receive a shipment.In my case Item was only 75$ valueBut I had to spend total 4 hours chasing shipment.20$ fee to pick up on weekends. On work days people usually work and don't drive to ups storages.Plus 50$ Uber cost drive to other city and back.So total experience was not worth it.You need to improve your order form to allow user to choose ups text notifications if you require a customer signature."

I specifically requested that they avoid the highly restrictive \"Adult Signature\" requirement, using the \"direct signature\" requirement that would allow me to send to to a FedEx Onsite. For reasons unknown, April sent my package not to me (so I could direct as I saw fit), instead, she sent it to an OnSite location of her choosing without asking me if this was acceptable. I asked to have it re-directed but that failed and it ended up going to the location she picked (seemingly at random since I am certain she has no idea where in my city I live with respect to this location). I even called the evening I found this out but no answer and no response...at all...other than the email asking where I wanted it sent to which I responded, but, that response failed to alter the delivery location). Maddening to have m order shipped to the wrong location this happen when I NEVER requested it. I have been a good customer but no longer after this shipping fiasco."

I had already said the service was great. The shipping carries lost the original headphones and they not only shipped another headphone but shipped a brand new one instead of the open box i had paid for. So 5 stars for service 3 stars for the product"

I would expect better service from a dealer selling high-end gear.  I might give them another try if the price is right, but they haven't yet won my loyalty to be my go-to place to buy headphones."

Sound is really clear, more or less neutral sounding but fits my usage perfectly. Only little annoyance about the headphones are the cable. Super long but otherwise still a great product. Only downside of this purchase was that fact that I paid a significant amount of tax and duties from purchasing internationally (from Canada). I paid almost half the cost of the headphones just in duties and taxes. If you are a Canadian resident and looking to purchase from this site I would steer clear from it and purchase locally. The \"free shipping\" to Canada will end up with you paying UPS absurd amounts in \"Customs Brokerage Fees\" on top of the \"Government Charges\" you will have to pay as well.

There appears to be a screen protector on the unit which is OK, but, it has some \"stuff\" on it or under it and thus will need to be replaced and leaves me wondering - why was it left on? This item was shipped in the original box but items I would have expected in the box weren't included (no manual, no USB...but there were some stuck together screen coverings, presumably from the original packaging - why those were left in there is inexplicable). The unit itself seems fine so far but my expectations of what \"open box\" means (based on having purchased many open box/refurbished items in the past) diverged from what arrived, leaving me less satisfied that I was expecting."

I\u00b4ve found that they\u00b4re not as loud as two other pairs of headphones I have.  Perhaps that\u00b4s due to new technology (planar magnetic).  So I need to turn up the volume on my receiver.  That\u00b4s okay.  The sound is good and clean and they\u00b4re comfortable to wear.  When I went to register them online I was unable to do so.  First the website wouldn\u00b4t take a PDF of the invoice and verification of delivery.  Then it didn\u00b4t allow me to put in the verification field, wherein you type in the text of the squiggly letters and/or numbers in a field.  It kept telling me I was wrong, but I\u00b4m sure I wasn\u00b4t.  It makes me believe that the Chinese manufacturer doesn\u00b4t want customers to be able to register their products.

They matched it with the understanding that at the the price they were matching, I was ineligible for the company's warrantee coverage. They emailed me an invoice, reflecting the agreed upon price; notified me when it was shipped; and sent me the corresponding tracking info, they'd promised me. The HD-650s arrived in good condition. They seem to be very well made (not flimsy) of a durable plastic. The fit is a bit too snug, but more comfortable than the last pair of 'phones I owned decades ago.  Midrange is good, and the bass a bit muddy, I've only been using them two days, so I expect them to improve with burn in. So far, so good. They are everything the rep at his keyboard led me to believe they would be. In parting, I should note all interaction with Headphones.com, up to this point, has been seamless. I highly recommend, doing business with them."

I first ordered some headphones but then wanted to change to an entry-level pc bundle and customer service was able to help me make that change instantly! The only thing I did not like was that the entry-level Sundara pc bundle I purchased didn't have an RCA cable to connect the DAC to the AMP nor did I know what an RCA cable was. Since I am pretty new to audio equipment ( a complete noob) I had a hard time trying to figure out how and why I couldn't hear anything once I set everything up. After a few google searches, I realized I needed an RCA cable so I went to buy one at Target and was able to complete the setup. I just thought since it was an entry-level pc bundle it would include everything I need to start, but it's also my fault for not fully checking what came with the bundle. Overall not a bad experience. :)"

I had to have the product held and then pick up at FedEx (Which would have been OK but they've updated their ID guidelines requiring the delivery address be on your ID and mine has a PO Box.  A real hurdle if I had specified the address as my work address).  The people I worked with via e-mail and support were great though so props to them."

The review done by your staff person was factual and detailed in helping me to make my decision regarding the KATO IEM.  I look forward to the sound getting even better over the next several months.  I have had them for only one week and just totally blown away by them.  The only downside was the shipping and delivery.  The delivery info was misleading."

I was not surprised that I had to pay extra customs and taxes, but I had to get this information from elsewhere. I think it would be very helpful to give this information on checkout, even if it's not an exact amount. Maybe just the information that there will be taxes and customs would help, but even better to link a page that does the calculation or calculate an estimation would be great."

As a business, I think they are still working out some operating kinks.  And I believe they will in short order.

Shipping was also done with DHL, which I really appreciated because receiving an imported package (to Canada) is so much with DHL than with FedEx.

You should know that I am 81 years  old and I use hearing aids. They work fine with the 800s and will work fine with the Ayra.  That said, I am an old audiophile who is just getting back into the game. No speakers, just headphones.  It would have helped so much to have spoken to someone in your shop to answer some questions and help with some concerns before buying. It is the reason four the 4 stars instead of 5.

A bit frustrating after spending $600. Anyways I'll update this review after I actually get the problem solved. Update; Caleb finally sent his own personal # since they don't have a reg. office landline phone. After speaking with him I feel more hopeful the situation will get resolved in good & professional fashion. We'll see.More to come.... Caleb was able to arrange for a full refund and free return shipping. the headphones are nice, just not for everyone. thanx again caleb for your help and support"

While I understand the that delivery date was not guaranteed (and that was made clear to me when purchasing the headphone - it was vague, saying early February, then changed to mid-Feb), I ended up going to forums to ask for this information. All good though, because my question got replied by the owners. More importantly, I got an e-mail later in the week with clarifications around the shipping date, so that improved my confidence greatly. Appreciate the honesty. Suggestion for improvements? Bit a bit more conservative with the shipping date next time (something I observed already happened with the shipping estimate for the Clear MG Pro, which seems like it has been nailed).The shopping experience overall was streamlined, and fairly clean - the site is pretty straightforward to use, and it's also quick to check the status of orders since the login is very quick. I have one suggestion, though: tone down the tracking cookies and notification features - every time I access the website using Chrome or Firefox, an annoying popup asks me if I want notifications.So, all and all, I would absolutely buy from Headphones.com again, being the shipping time for ready-to-ship items so fast."

No frequent charging needed.Noise Cancellation: The noise cancellation is legit. It does the job of drowning out background noise pretty well, making the audio clear and focused. It\u2019s a useful feature, especially in noisy environments.Customer Service: What made headphones.com stand out was their service. It\u2019s rare to get good advice these days with so many options online. The team there actually listens and suggests what works for you. It\u2019s straightforward, no-nonsense, and helpful.Final Take: If you\u2019re looking for a solid pair of earbuds and want a place where you can get honest advice, headphones.com is a good bet. The Sennheiser CX Plus True Wireless does what it says and does it well. Happy with the purchase."

          "Contenu": "Great selection of audiophile quality headphones and accessories. Bought several items --including open box products -- that were delivered quickly and in perfect condition. The best part of the shopping experience are the expert forums and audio testing that helps to describe how each model sounds (and feels) on or over ear. I have a few wired and wireless models --- Audeze, Focal, and HifiMan -- and each has a different specific \"purpose\" -- For use with a DAC, I like the DAC setting on my Focal Utopias (wired) and Bathys (wireless). The soundstage is wider and deeper in the Utopias and there is more detail in the high range. The Bathys are excellent in every other way and amzing for travel. My sense is that Focal has nailed the portable mid-range headphone so much better than most of the wireless models for sale at electronics stores because it has a comfortable, natural fit over the ears, with a closed back that blocks sound tremendously well and, if you require the ANC for flights, it is provided at low power output so there is no phasing buzz like in the Bose, Beats, Sennheiser and Sony model lines. For listening to classical or piano jazz music, the open box (demo?) wired pair of the HifiMan Arya Organic I got on Headphones arrived in perfect condition. They have among best soundstage that produces a balanced and accurate sound at nearly any volume."

          "Contenu": "The DCA E3 headphones are awesome!FWIW, I have 17 pairs of headphones, with 3 being \u201cflagship\u201d and over $3K. I was looking at both the Stealth and Expanse, but wasn\u2019t sure they would be different enough or worth it to me for the $4K. I also considered the Aeon Noire 2, but had hesitation. When DMS reviewed the E3 as a real upgrade from the Noire, yet even better or on par with the Stealth and Expanse, yet was only $2K\u2026 I immediately bought them. So glad I did! Very \u201copen\u201d sounding for a closed back with great separation. The frequency response is almost perfect to my ears without EQ. I am a bit of a bass head, so I will likely add a 3dB sub bass shelf. However, I will be happy to listen to these without that as well. Great detail capture."

I had to go the FedEx center to pick up my package even though 2 day delivery with signature was paid for. I won't have FedEx deliver ANYTHING to me since this has happened numerous times in past years. The Audio U4s that I ordered are excellent, providing amazing clarity and a very top notch listening experience. However there was no manual or instructions on how to use the Apex modules."

          "Contenu": "I was considering a few headphones before deciding on this one. I have to mention Sam Cooper for providing me with the necessary information and his own perspective for me to decide on one. On top of that he was really helpful in resolving a payment hiccup and made sure my order gets shipped the same day. I live in Canada and I got the headset delivered the very next day. It did not feel like an open box item in any way.Now about the headset. This was my first \u201caudiophile grade\u201d headset. The first impression was okay, I tried paying few songs from Tidal via AAC, and used the DAC mode too. It was really good but honestly I couldn\u2019t really tell what all those reviewers were saying about it being truly amazing. I\u2019ve heard about headphones burn in periods and decided to give it a try by playing pink noise for like 20 hours. Maybe it\u2019s placebo but I could feel it being better. But all that changed when I decided to watch the new Gran Turismo movie with it. It was absolutely incredible, unlike anything I\u2019ve experienced before. It never felt like I was watching a movie with headphones on. I highly recommend the Bathys especially with the open box pricing."

I decided on a pair of open back headphones and they couldn\u2019t have been more helpful in deciding the best pair and doing the swap so I was without. Pair of headphones for a very short time. I really like the new pair and completely recommend Headphones.com to everyone. Terrific customer service."
