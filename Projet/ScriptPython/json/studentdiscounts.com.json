I emailed asking for Urgent assistance and it really did not matter how much I spent, it was over $100 by the way, because I got assistance four days later which caused me a great deal of problems with my school program. And when I did get assistance the program still did not work. I ended up getting the program to work from a technology department from my school. Horrible customer assistance after the purchase of course. Very disappointed."

I found what I needed easily enough but any convenience or even courtesy stopped there, after my card had been processed. I could not download the software due to a \"full disk\" error. When I reached out to StudentDiscounts via electronic message I was given an email address with only a short message saying that the email was tech support. I had to go back and forth with several emails.  All responses were curt. When I asked for a phone number to speak with someone the response was a request to access my computer remotely. The person on the other end had not even told me their name at this point. I asked and was given the name, Les. When I called the phone number on the website, Les, sent me to a very rude man to access my computer remotely to try and fix the download problem.  I was told that my \"system\" was too \"old\", and that there was nothing he could do.  I was told that Windows 7 could not run any newer versions of the software that I had purchased and that I would have to downgrade, at no discount. I emailed my professor and he said that he is running Windows 7 and that he has the new version of this software. I had to go to a third party and pay additional money to enable the download.From the moment my money was taken, my experience with StudentDiscounts was, at the very least, negligent and disrespectful."

There, I was told they do not sell the QB 2014  Academic Version.\r I had signed up for an online course that began more than 10 days ago.  Four days later, I was still trying unsuccessfully to acquire and DL the software I was looking for.  The class had already started and I was already \"2 days late\"!  \r There seemed to be no way to get your site to accept my \"other documentation\" because the university had not issued me an email address that ended in .edu.\r Despite multiple emails and telephone calls, no one could provide me with the Academic Version of QuickBooks Pro 2014 from [external reference].  When I finally reached someone who would work with me, I \"bit the bullet\"  I placed an order (that was not an Academic Version and DLd what I thought was the QB version I needed... \r It turned out to be the Accountant version.... when I finally logged into my class, nothing made sense... the instructors directions did not agree with the software product I purchased from [external reference]\r I finally called [external reference] and ended up buying a $299+ version (non-academic) QB Pro+ and DL'd the software.... I still don't think I ended up with the subscription benefits I had anticipated from [external reference]\r The [external reference] rep told me to contact you for a refund... If that wouldn't work, get back in touch with them.\r Nevertheless, today I received this \"How did we do?\" email.... so, I'm telling you.\r The one silver lining in this (if it works out) is that when  went back to your website, I called and got in touch with one of your reps (the number given on this email was constantly busy) the person I talked to was very understanding, courteous, and professional... (I'm counting on this current assessment.) \r He asked about the \"boxed software\" I received (which did not even open) and told me \"As soon as I hang up, I will send you an email with a 'free shipping label' you can print out and tape to the boxed software to return it to us.  When we receive the box (probably within the week,) we will refund the total amount you paid us.\r I did not ask if there will be a \"re-stocking fee\" assessed... If that happens, I will take more draconian actions.... but I don't expect that to happen.\r When I get my refund, all will be forgiven (I'm finally online in my course and have caught up to the class,) and when I finally get an email address ending in .edu I will favorably consider returning to Student.Discount.com to do business again.\r Here's hoping an email will be waiting for me from your rep as soon as I post this review and follow through on his promise.\r I will change my rating if all goes well, but for now, one star will have to do."

While expensive, I REALLY needed the software.  I didn't receive the order either the following day, as expected, nor by 2 pm CST on Friday.  I called the customer service number and they couldn't really explain why it hadn't shipped.  I finally got my order on Monday and was refunded the $44.00 fee for overnight shipping."

Overall the situation was resolved by receiving a new code for a different edition of the software I ordered but was left disappointed and frustrated by the lack of expertise and follow-through from customer service.EDIT TO CLARIFY-- I received an updated code after the one originally supplied was expired. Poor review due to poor customer service. Difficult to talk to customer service, the rep I originally talked to didn't know the hours of operation for the phone service, I was able to find out after digging through the website. Frustrating that the customer service rep didn't know this and didn't offer to find out. I had been talking to a different (higher-up I assume) rep after the first rep couldn't help me with the code. We set up a session where they tried to help me with the downloading, all they did was pin the software to my task bar. Was then told to restart my computer and then it should work, it did not work. Was told that I would be moved back onto the queue and would be contacted once it was my turn, I was never reached out to again after this. The lack of follow through, lack of expertise and lack of help is the reason for the poor review. Of course, if I hadn't received an expired code I wouldn't have gone through all this but I was left disappointed with the customer service. The expired code was all IBM's issue, the poor customer service is all Student Discounts. I was able to finally get the software to work after consulting other people outside of Student Discounts and now the software works.Last update-- The second customer service rep I had (Les) was easy to work with, it seems that on the macro system the customer service division lacked."

I paid twice without complaint as I was relieved to be able to still continue with my PhD course - however I think this should be made much clearer to students.

That said the customer service is great as they do try to make things right and troubleshoot and offer a refund. So I do love that and keep coming back because of it. I should also note the software I buy from them (SPSS) is notoriously buggy so a lot of it is not their fault. But they should still tell you not to buy versions with known compatibility issues, and I've had problems with SPSS from them on previous Macbooks and previous SPSS versions."

I have ordered from other websites that require verification and was able to download my software the same day.  I was hoping to use the software over the weekend and thought about canceling my order and going somewhere else but the website has little information and nobody available over the weekend so I was concerned I would still be stuck with the bill if I took this route.  Do not order Friday if you need the software quickly."

They offered to reset my subscription so I could download the second copy I had originally paid for, but was unable to access.  I had since purchased a second license and was in the middle of data evaluation, so I did not want to lose the new license and potentially any data I was working with currently.  The resolution was they refunded the cost of the second license.  I do appreciate the customer service resolution."

          "Contenu": "I purchased a 2-month subscription to SPSS as my license had just run out and I was on a tight deadline what with my honors thesis being due in under 3 weeks.  Upon attempting to run the analyses I was required to do, I realised I had accidentally purchased an insufficient version of SPSS.  As per the instructions on the website I contacted the company via their support email requesting an exchange.  I sent them two emails, two days apart, and have still heard nothing 9 days later.  As a result, I have wasted $50ish dollars on a program that is of no use to me, and had to make three 1-hour round trips to campus specifically to use their computers to run my analyses.  Will never purchase anything from StudentDiscounts again, and will warn away anyone who considers doing so.UPDATE: Less than an hour after I posted my original review, the 'head manager' of StudentDiscounts contacted me to apologise and offered to upgrade my version of SPSS to the required one free of charge.  As I told him, the crisis period has already come and gone, so having access to the program is of far less assistance than it would have been 1.5 weeks ago, but the gesture is appreciated.  I'm changing my review to a mid-way 3 stars in light of this development.  Hopefully StudentDiscounts review their turnaround times for support requests, as other than not receiving communication from them of any kind (which burdened me greatly IRL) until I left a negative review, I have no complaints about their business."

However, when I called StudentDiscount and told a salesperson about the problem and the recommended problem as described by Geek Squad, he would not listen to m and insisted I uninstall the program (4th or 5th time) and try a reboot. When I told him I'd performed the same procedure several times he insisted I \"try\". I reluctantly did with the same results. Then and only then did he submit report to their IT department. Actually, I had already contacted their IT department and got an email telling me that they would respond within 24 hours. I really wanted to get going with using the program, so that's when I used the live chat feature to dialogue with the sales person. After talking with the sales person, he sent me an email indicating that he'd filed a service report and someone would respond within the next 24 hours. Later that morning, I received a couple of emails. One indicated that problem sounded like a computer problem or something. The other, from the same source, indicated definitively that I had the \"wrong product key\" and posted the correct one (LOL). Full circle back to what I knew hours earlier and what the salesman did not believe. Again, great product poor customer service."

I was all the time checking my personal mailbox as the confirmation of complaint registration came there. Eventually, the responses and the license key got buried in my student mailbox.I thank the support for their swift action, and their offer to refund money if I am not satisfied. I did not take the refund as my software license got vadidated today.I correct myself and state that Student Discounts has been the right place to get SPSS software for your research work as a student. Now I can even confirm that they are very swift in their support as well. You will be in safe hands.___________________________________First review - 2023-07-17Ordered AMOS 29 2-year license on July 17 but have not yet received the license keys. Look like my money ($79) is gone.The customer support is completely unreliable as every time I raise a request over the live chat, an email is sent and nothing happens. So, far I have 2 emails from 2 separate requests I sent for license keys.I will not trust and will not recommend this site to buy licenses. I have had consistently good experience with \"onthehub\". Feeling bad why i did not order this from there."

I had no idea what IW as supposed to \"just do\" so we took a chance that we would get information when we made the purchase that would be intuitive to follow up on.   We purchased the software blindly and when an email came we forwarded it to him, then another came and we forwarded it to him - realizing the second email had a key# and login information in it that he would ultimately need.I would suggest a quick PDF How-To for what could have been a graphic step by step - instead of an email response to just pay for it and send the email to your son!He was able to log in and is using it with his class as intended.Thank you."
