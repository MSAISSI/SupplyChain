          "Contenu": "Server worked for 3 days before issues started, Tried to do the support by email, and they don't respond back until a day later and didn't help with the issue really. Tried to do a support ticket through the discord server and they couldn't even find out why one of the issues was occurring (the server wouldn't start). I had to go in myself and find a fix for 2 out of the 3 issues. The 3rd issue was the biggest one and they asked a senior support person for help. That person never responded and 7 days went by without a response or a fix to it and they just closed and deleted the ticket. I emailed them asking for my money back and they told be that since 7 days already went by of using the service, I cannot get a refund back. I responded with, we only used the server for 3 days before issues started happening and we couldn't even log on to the server and it takes forever to get a respond back just for y'all to not fix the issues I am having with the server, and then you delete the discord ticket I had. I have yet to get a follow up email about the refund. One of the worst experience I have ever had and it was very stressful. I was never once mean or had an attitude with them but at a certain point I had to get a bit assertive to try and get some kind or resolution, which I did not get. Do not use them. So many other better hosting site out there. If you do use them I wish you good luck, and Supercraft I wish you well."

Things ran fine for the first two weeks, but in the last week we (up to only 6 players) have been experiencing consistent server lag during the blood moons (client FPS is fine, but zombies are unresponsive/walking in place). Looking at the server status during those periods, it seems to be rarely above 6% utilization.Looking at the support channel on discord, it seems like people complaining about lag are pretty much ignored, which is not encouraging.

For some mod pack YOU HAVE TO buy the hightest plan. You don't need 64 slots ? Shame, buy it or you can't play with your mods. They do say that they can make personnalized plan but when asked they say \"No, this modpack is really heavy you have to buy the biggest plan\". I can understand the need for ram and CPU and the price that come with that, but then don't say you do personnalized plan if we can't have the choice to pay a bit less (Like 5 euro) to just have lesser slot.Most of others site propose things like this.I don't know how to answer, i don't even know if it is possible so i'll edit this message.What i was saying is that it is possible on a lot of other providers, to have less slots and then pay A BIT less. I don't want to pay 6$ but 30 a month for a small group of players is a bit too much. We did found an other provider that has a better offer for us, and are happy about it. Maybe i wasn't really clear whith the \"Like 5 euro\" if was meaning 25$ instead of 30$ for the month. English isn't my first language.Well even if it wasn't very clear about it there was no need to be this aggressive with your answer. I'm pretty happy that we moved to another provider if that the way you answer your client."
