          "Titre": "I don't recommend unless you like being monitored continuously.",
          "Contenu": "There are a lot of things potential customers need to know before hiring SimpleTexting. First, set up was not fast for us. The company required business license/EIN number, copy of ID, and business registration which took us a week to get approved and move forward. It was frustrating when we sent our first text and only 2K of our 7K texts were sent. That's because we weren't told that we had to pay more for a \"vetting\" process. Also, if you add your own company URL in the text, it gets flagged for \"monitoring\". Keep in mind this company is on the East Coast. So, if you send a text for an event at 5pm in the evening and it gets stuck in \"monitoring\" because you used a \"flagged\" key text or something, your text won't go out until they get into the office the following day. If you send during their business hours, they can approve in an hour or less. This was a problem for us on many levels! First, our entire list was not aware of an event we were having on our first text. On our second text, it didn't even go out and we missed advertising to our customers about that evening's event all together. From business registration to number registration to cell phone companies limiting the texts we sent to our own customers, it caused our company a lot of grief. The process was not easy and extremely frustrating. Once we thought it was time to go, another delay and another delay. It was always something new. My client is very disappointed that we were flagged and monitored just because we used our own website URL so our guests could click on our calendar of events. WAY too much red tape. That said, we seem to be set up now and ready to go after all that. We just have to make sure our texts go out before 5pm PST so that their \"Monitoring\" system doesn't delay your texts and the Simpletext staff can release the message. Otherwise, forget it. Be sure to archive messages so you're not charged for a text that says, \"Come tonight\" and it sends tomorrow because they are not in the office when you want your text to go out. It's BS. It really is. Spammers have really made doing business difficult. But after a few bad lessons, we just have to get around all the red tape. I wouldn't suggest using this service if you want freedom to send text to your list when you want without being monitored and delayed all the time. They are not even on Yelp or Google reviews. Even testimonials are monitored. :(  I really love the system though. It's easy to operate and the reports are nice. Customer service has really tried to be there, but they can't fix these problems. If you like being \"monitored\" go for it! If you have a big list, be prepared to only have 2K texts go out at once so ask for vetting. We just want to help others avoid the frustrations we encountered. Good luck."

          "Contenu": "Ordered about $300 of texts. Last minute change meant we didn\u2019t need them anymore. Asked for refund. \u201cWe can\u2019t do refunds for orders made more than a week ago.\u201d MFW I ordered 4 days ago. I reply, stating I had ordered 4 days ago. They apologize about their mistake. Still says they cannot offer refund, without an explanation. RIP $300.Update; mere hours after posting this review, I was directly contacted by a SimpleTexting team member. Mr. Brian was very helpful. He basically stated that my interaction should never have happened, he also informed me that my refund was on its way (albeit a month late XD). It was in the bank account the next morning. While I commend Mr. Brian for directly reaching out and taking time out of his day, I also cannot overlook the initial interaction. I also cannot ignore the fact that the situation looks like damage control. Either way, I got what I needed, and I\u2019m changing my review from one star to three stars. Thank you."

I wish I could use it more for marketing and sending automatic replies, etc. but I haven't spent a lot of time learning the different features.  I would suggest having a weekly or monthly webinar for members on how to maximize the use of this app, how to create campaigns, etc. I would rather spend an hour on a webinar than 20 minutes reading about it and then an hour trying to figure out how to do it."

Took the $$ right away, fine, but took more than 8 hours and a note to service before the account was upgraded. A certain amount of unnecessary worry, planning and initial execution went into a truly lousy Plan B because your support was offline until after I needed to send the blast. To your service's credit, I received a note back from support prior to the announced hour allowing me to abandon the lousy Plan B and ship all via your service. The upshot? If you take the dough, make it go. Right away. Thanks"
