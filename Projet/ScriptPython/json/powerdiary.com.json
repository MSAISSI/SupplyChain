          "Contenu": "Although initially I thought the design was great, and that they were good at helping me as a customer become familiar with the platform. I feel powerdiary is more about getting customers to rely on the familiarity of the platform. In my opinion, a company will always show its quality when  issues arise and they will address these with ease. However, this was not my experience with PowerDiary as they failed to express appreciation for me as a customer and lacked empathy (quite happy to let me go elsewhere rather than compensate). I now have been left with the opinion that money is more important than satisfied long term customers. As a business I lost clients (income). Powerdiary lack the initiative in resolving my complaint losing A LOT of MONEY due to repetitive technical issues when paid ads are running and clients are trying to book on a system that is experiencing problems their end. I am now looking for another provider which they know is difficult for UK users, I feel a little trapped with a company I don't want to be with.In response to your reply: I did contact you by email and explaining all this. I really don't like leaving reviews as I hope you would offer resolution. Your response felt cold, and there was no compliment for our loss. I then expressed I was looking for another company due the issues this keeps causing. You response to this was I was welcome to go elsewhere if I wasn't happy. This reply is not what I consider valuing your long term customer."

          "Contenu": "The call center was not able to resolve my issue. What I really disliked about the incident is that they never once came back to me regarding progress, I had to chase the issue. After 10 days they seemed to be uncertain about the issue. Now after 13 days I am still no closer to a solution with no feedback. It seems that they hope I will go away. My assumption is that the team is not senior enough in customer care and they seem reluctant or unable to escalate the matter. The issue raised is fundamental to the trustworthiness of the system. I have now established, after my own investigation that the system generated reports do not include all transactions. This place significant uncertainty on the accuracy of reporting."

          "Contenu": "I've only been using the system for a couple of weeks but seem to find a bug at least once a day. I moved from WriteUpp because our practice is expanding and we're taking on placement students. Turns out that you can let a student see their diary, but if you want them to be able to write notes for their clients, you need to give them access to your full client database! Nuts! Customer Support not very helpful acknowledging the problem.Update 20/1/23 in response to Power Diary's reply. To clarify, the confidentiality issue relates to seeing any of a person's details. I wish for other practitioners and students in the practice to only see names of those clients they have been assigned to. However, I am told by Customer Support, that in order to write notes for their clients they need to have access to the 'People' menu. If they have access to the people menu then they can see the name, address, date of birth, phone number and email address of *every single client in the practice*, thus breaching the client's confidentiality."

The option to now book in calls to customer support is great (previously was online only which wasn't my preference), and the only reason it doesn't have 5 stars is because it lacks some basic features in notes section (e.g. formatting), and it needs more customisability when it comes to session packs/third-party funding tracking (which I have found easier in other software programs I have used in the past).Nov 2020 Update: - Been a buggy few weeks so have updated my rating. Seems to slow at least a few times a week for a few hours. Not sure if too many users, but they need to fix this as this is very annoying!"

Deep Tissue Massage with the legal, necessary client information questions and 3. Remedial Massage again with and legal, necessary client information questions and so forth.

Now that I have been using it for several months, I am finding it pretty straightforward and efficient to use. I'm a sole trader so having things that streamline my work is essential. A couple of features I would like are the sending of receipts once you have ticked that an invoice is paid, and I would like to have templates use a contact name autofill rather than the client name, as I work with children. One thing that I think power diary does well is provide step by step instructions for how to do anything in the platform... a simple search usually gives me the steps I need. I'm very happy with Powerdiary and intend to keep using it for the long term."

We're still tweaking it to individualise it for ourselves - and while it is a strong platform as is, we've enjoyed making it work for us. Before we started using it, I asked about their policies about sharing information to third parties and their protection of our client's privacy. I was very happy with their response and how openly they shared their policies and protection measures about privacy and confidentiality. Well done Power Diary."

Activity reports are great. The different service types are of course useful too.  I am yet to use the communication templates but I imagine they will be just as good.  I haven't used the invoicing tool yet, just a matter of time.  Looks easy enough.  Couple of minor negatives: not being able to send a reminder morning of appointment date, and not being able to change times for reminders for interstate clients during daylight saving.  Otherwise, an excellent product.  Highly recommend it."

I would like to see as an upgrade for Powerdiary, the ability to 'block-out' appointments as a block. I mean, if I have one-hour appointments available, (even though I have my diary set out in 30min sections as I have 30min between each booking) that the pre-formatted bookings that I view at the practitioner's end are viewed as one-hour blocks...not two 30min blocks. When I need to book an appointment manually, I have to make sure I highlight both 30min sections as it doesn't recognise the appointment as an hour. This would be more convenient and to ensure that I have the whole hour booked. I have contacted support and they explained that this wasn't an option, however I have used other software that allows for this, so hopefully this may be an option in the future."

Occasionally there are glitches or minor problems with features, but the team are always right on top of this, sorting it out as soon as possible. When customers provide feedback on how their product can be improved the Powerdiary team accepts this with gratitude and looks to respond to this feedback with improvement to their product. Because of this great service and responsiveness to feedback I feel confident that I'll stay with them for a long time as my businesses grow. (Please note: I was offered a $25 gift card in exchange for writing this review. However, this has not coloured my feedback: I do think Powerdiary is a very good product)."

Different sections are well organised and with some training, it is easy to navigate.I only have two things that frustrate me - the invoices attached to the calendar often glitch and don't carry on with regular clients, so I need to rewrite them frequently; and my immediate supervisor doesn't have access to my diary (but that could be an organisational decision?).I would definitely be happy to recommend Power Diary to anyone using them under similar employment circumstances."

The only real issue I have is the big jump in cost from 9 diaries to 10 (or really from the Medium User - 4-9 Diaries - to the Large User 10 - 20 Diaries).  In our practice we have 10-12 part-time/casual practitioners... so for all to have a 'full-time' diary, it means a jump  in about $1000 per year.  It's a shame the fees can't be in smaller increments per diary rather than such a big jump in cost."

It is a straight forward system to use for invoicing, and this helps me keep on top of the financial aspects of my work. I also really like that clients don't have to download software to use the telehealth system and that they get a unique code that they can save for all their calls. My only improvement would be to be able to send calendar invites with the link embedded as some people are now used to this with other systems, but I use the emailing reminder to enable clients to always have the link to hand. I am also happy to use a system that complies with GDPR (uk) and I can be confident saying to clients that their information is stored safely - and isn't on my computer, but in a secure password protected system.Its also affordable for small private practitioners like myself."

          "Contenu": "I have been a user of Power Diary since starting up my practice almost 3 years ago. I wanted a paperless, efficient, organised, and integrated system in working which included all aspects of my practice from taking enquires, all the way to taking payments, providing electronic Medicare rebates, and sending discharge letters where letters were partially pre-filled. Power Diary does so much for me that I have not needed a virtual assistant or to hire a bookkeeper! I have Xero and Stripe connected to Power Diary which makes my bookkeeping and taking payments a breeze! Power Diary is flexible where you can use it as little or as much as you like. I have become dependent on Power Diary. I feel assured that it will continue on due to the commitment Power Diary has to their practice management system, with updates and security ongoing, and responding to feedback and collaboration with other systems."

I\u2019ve been using Power Diary for 3-years and one of the things I\u2019m most impressed by is the way the program is constantly undergoing development. It therefore remains relevant during  the many shifts in practice management. By also being web based, I am always accessing the most up to date program, without interruption or glitches usually involved in updating. This has been really helpful and I have been able to easily add Telehealth sessions and online booking. I\u2019ve also moved to processing medicare via Power Diary which is far easier than using Hicaps machine or Proda. It really does do almost everything I need.  If there were was a way to also process private health claims,  I think it would be perfect."
