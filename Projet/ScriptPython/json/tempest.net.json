          "Contenu": "I put 100% of the blame on Tempest for the downfall of my server. Since the Rust memory leak, I have had virtually zero support from tempest on various issues. The most communication I have received in the last year or so has been \"We're working on it\" and no response afterThe tempest tech support team is utterly useless in troubleshooting Rust issues. During the memory leak they told me countless times that AI was the cause of crashing on my server, even after I had AI completely disabled. You guys cost me my entire player base, which never recovered. Granted we were only about a 40-50 pop at that time, we were just starting to pick up. I had asked time and time again if the amount of memory allocation was the issue and I was given a \"no, it is your AI.\" I all but begged the support team to help me as I was at a loss. Only a month later did they finally admit that more memory on my server was the cause all along. The shoddy support and massive number of reliability issues this year caused my little server to tank, as I told the support a myriad of times, **players do not play on unreliable servers**They do not care unfortunately. Gameserver customers are a dime a dozen. I hope in the future, some helpdesk support guys that are able to actually assist Rust customers in resolving issues."

          "Titre": "My worst dedicated hosting experience",
          "Contenu": "I was looking for a provider in the USA with DDOS protection. I saw the offer from this provider, which is also a subsidiary of Path.I needed a custom server in the USA with the installation of my address space (subnets) on an autonomous system from the Tempest provider. In the chat, they offered me a dedicated Chicago server with a Ryzen 9 5950X CPU, and the set-up date was set for April 3rd, 2023. I clearly stated that I will need an announcement for my IPv6 subnets to their AS, as well as a static route from their router to my server. The tech support said that everything will be done as I want, and that I will be able to use my subnets on their AS 36231. I was sent a bill of $599 on March 29th, 2023, which I paid the next day, i.e., March 30th, 2023, using LTC through a BitPay aggregator.I immediately opened a ticket and specified that I needed to set up 4 subnets on their autonomous system, 3 of which I sent them on the 2nd of April (along with LOA) and valid ROA and RPKI entries. I sent the last subnet on April 3rd, with a LOA and valid ROA and RPKI entries as before.That being said, I was assured that there is no fee for this, as well as no limit on the prefixes placed. After providing them with all the information, I waited, and on April 3rd, 2023, I was sent the custom server data, only the subnets were not announced and linked, so I didn\u2019t even try to enter that server.Starting from April 3rd, they started feeding me with \u201cit will be done tomorrow\u201d, the customer support couldn\u2019t provide any deadlines for their work, and the server without subnets is useless. I stated the purpose  beforehand and said that subnets must be installed, as I won\u2019t be able to work otherwise. From the 3rd to the 7th of April, they didn\u2019t actually answer any of my questions, although I was writing them every day. They were constantly going off topic, confusing the terminology, and kept asking me what I need these subnets for, although I had told them before, and they always told me to \u201cwait\u201d or apologized for the delays. I even offered to pay for the setup and escalation of the ticket, but they said that everything is under control, and I just have to wait. Starting on April 7th, I contacted Path, among others, with a complaint against Tempest, as it is their subsidiary. They replied to my ticket the same day and apologized. They also said that the ticket will be given priority for network engineers. Ultimately, nothing happened until April 10th, besides me sending more customer service appeals and receiving meaningless replies from Tempest. In the end, it turned out that they are not able to announce prefixes on their standalone system, i.e., they cannot provide the service they are offering. Moreover, not only did they mislead me and waste 10 days of my time, during which paid subnets were not used, they also decided not to give me a refund. First, they referred to their TOS, which, according to them, prohibits the refunds of crypto payments, but I read them before paying for the server, and there was nothing about that, just as there was nothing after the reply of the support. I saved the page in the web archive and told them that I am being scammed and deceived, as there\u2019s no clause that says that. After that, I said that all the information and details will be made public on review aggregators and web-forums to warn people about working with this \u201cshady\u201d provider. To which they replied that they will consult with the manager and give me an answer. As a result, they gave me a refund on BitPay on April 11th, 2023, which was came to me yesterday (18 of April). As I have already asked BitPay, the problem was on the side of Tempest again, so they solved it for 1 week.I can provide all screenshots of conversations within the chats and tickets, as well as with BitPay customer support.Avoid this hosting, it is a waste of money and time. This is my worst experience in more than a year of working with various hosting providers. During all this time, I spoke with 7 people from customer support, and not one of them solved any of my problems and just talked for nothing."

          "Contenu": "I ordered a 12900KS machine and waited over 2 and a half months for it to be delivered. When it finally arrived, there were several issues. First, there was no IPMI access and on top of that they installed the wrong operating system. Then there was also the machine name, which for some reason was called \"VITAL-PENDING-LONDON-1\". These minor issues alone took several days to be resolved. After the operating system issues were fixed, the machine seemed to run smoothly for a while.However, I experienced daily network drops. After 6 weeks of using the server, I woke up to it being offline. So, I contacted support and after a few weird questions from them for example: \u201cIs this very urgent?\u201d, they called up the remote techs and the server was back in an hour or two. Eventually, the server began going offline once or even twice a day. Upon investigation, Tempest discovered that the crashes were caused by faulty power supplies and said they would replace them. However, I never received any information on how long the replacements would take, despite multiple attempts to get an update. I eventually had to move to another provider due to the 12th gen still not being fixed after almost 2 months. In total, I spent 10 weeks waiting for the machine, used it for 6 weeks without issues, and then it was pretty much unusable for 7 weeks, so after that I moved providers. They also turned the CPU speeds from 5.4GHz down to 5.2GHz without telling me anything.I also had a negative experience with a second machine that I ordered from Tempest. On 04/24/2022 I placed an order for a 12900K machine that was supposed to be delivered within the same week. I reached out on the 29th for updates and was told that the team should reach out soon. On the 15th of May, I finally received it, much later than promised but I wasn\u2019t too bothered. When I ran a benchmark on it, the results were identical to a Ryzen 5900x. After talking to SEVERAL staff members, we were finally (after about 4 attempts) able to get a good score on the benchmark.I didn't list all my issues and problems, but these should be the main ones.I have also had some good experiences on lower end machines, I had a 5900X, a 5800X,a micro cloud server and 2 shared servers all of which didn't have issues. Overall, I would not recommend Tempest as a hosting provider due to their long delivery times, various issues with the machines, and poor communication and support."

That being said I have to compliment their support team. Their support teams and billing teams are very understanding, and they do what they can to solve your problems quickly and seem pretty knowledgeable. I've had worse support experiences with other providers but tempest's support team seemed to be more coordinated and open."

          "Contenu": "Didn\u2019t get server in 24-48 hours as promised via ticket. Has been pending for 53 hours now. Edit: after my second ticket the server was delivered.So far the bandwidth has been good, no ability to remove the firewall entirely from the server, forces everything to go through the filter. Staff have been around in discord and seem friendly enough. Peering to the EU is stellar. Can do about 3gbit on a single thread to NFOrce and 500-750mbit to Hetzner 1g servers. Only provider really with 10gbit unmetered bandwidth at a reasonable price, so bonus points for that. Update: Aug 14, 2022Recently added a second dedi from these guys in their Singapore location. Able to do ~1gbps between US and that location and about 3gbit to hetzner. Automatic deployment failed for a second time using Debian 11 but was fixed after I waited for 3 hours to put in a support ticket. Staff were asked to only get it online and to IPMI and not execute the OS install but still executed the OS install despite the instruction not to do so, costing me another hour of my time while I both waited for the initial install to complete and for the additional install I had to do myself. Still a good network, some rough riding from time to time but that\u2019s fine. I only really use the servers as a CDN that hits aws r53 (which verifies they\u2019re up before pointing traffic to them). Still no ipv6 support on the horizon but it does fine on ipv4 for the most part. Overall experience, 3.5/5. This review will be updated as testing continues."

          "Contenu": "Inaccurate Delivery Times, Awful Support, Incompetent System EngineersThe only reason I give them 2 stars is because of their Path.net DDoS protection. That's the only positive aspect I've experienced from Tempest.Firstly, the support. I waited for a response on my ticket for over 36 days. It was a simple request for a BGP announcement. Tempest has a major lack of competent staff members, which leads to crazy long wait times. I'm not the only customer waiting months for support, I've heard numerous Tempest.net horror stories. I ended up giving up on waiting for my support ticket to be completed and they refunded me, at least it was a simple process to get refunded.Delivery times have been a major issue for Tempest, there is a huge lack of in-stock servers means you can be waiting a few months to year for a custom server order delivery especially in certain locations. Tempest has a major issue with hiring, instead of hiring like an actual company would, they resort to hiring in-experienced systems engineers that lack any formal education on completing day-to-day operations a network or system engineer would usually complete. I believe this to be the reason of these numerous horror stories you'll hear coming from Tempest. Zigi is the only staff member to my knowledge that's able to complete tasks with networking such as BGP, that is laughable for a million dollar company like Path / Tempest.Compared to similar hosting companies that can get this task done in 1 day, Tempest takes 36 times longer.EDIT: Tempest has resolved the problem and announced my IP range and added 3 months of free service to my dedicated servers."

In my personal experience any issues have typically been resolved within 30 minutes of opening a ticket on their website. Though pricing can be steep you get what you pay for. If you're looking to grow something and want it stable, Tempest is the place. Overall while being with Tempest we have not had experienced any lag or attacks on any of our servers.

Kyan found my plight through a Rust Administration Discord post and private messaged me to get me set up on Tempest ASAP. They were very friendly and the whole process was completely pain free. They set me up with an amazing deal I absolutely could not pass up on. I am a little new to game server hosting and had a few questions that they answered quickly and satisfactorily. There are a few instances after setup where I needed help and they provided. I also received a considerable amount of help and input from Bushhy over Discord which is unmatched customer service compared to my last host. They have been a wonderful resource and a friendly conversationalist so I wanted to give credit where credit is due. I am grateful that Tempest has given me such excellent service and will absolutely recommend them to any friends seeking hosting services.Thank you Tempest!"

If someone in the discord points out something like the packets are being dropped or there is a high ping, the problem will be solved within a few minutes.I've been a customer for 3 months and I'm very satisfied!The tickets are also dealt with within a few minutes, although you have to do your own work from time to time by presenting it to them that there is a problem, but that's how it should work. Working together between customers and employees is important."

I am a client on path and tempest and use both their services. They're essentially the same thing.]The service is just wonderful. From the start, the quality has always been top-notch. Their staff team is very helpful, calm, and very quick to respond. It is very unlikely to have any issues where there's a downtime of your service.The reviews don\u2019t justify the reliability, quality, and experience that you get provided. I'm able to confidently host a content delivery network, offering protection to numerous clients without any worry of downtime. They have many, many locations where you'll always have a great connection to a server close by for yourself or your client.Now onto my experience with their protection and network:Very fast, 10gbit fiber ports with unmetered bandwidth.Never had one single downtime due to a ddos attacks. I have been hit with 300gbit/s+ on one server, their mitigation is #1, you won't find better anywhere else literally 10 times better than MT, VOX, OVH, etc...The service has always been reliable and you can't get anything better than with path. Sounds crazy to say but from all the bare metal, cloud hosting, collocated, enterprise game hosting, from literally every single option out there, you cannot find something close to the level of the path.The CEO Marshal has been great and even though he's busy with huge enterprise customers, he still makes time for the little guys :)Not much more to say than if you're not with path, you aren't using the best service out there..."

          "Contenu": "My community has been using different services for years to host FiveM & TeamSpeak servers.  We tried manage solutions, dedicated hardware, anything we could get our hands on. Our services were constantly targeted by DDoS attacks and people trying to take our network offline. We were also plagued by false promises by companies who would ignore us after our server was hit offline. Then we found Tempest, ever since switching their specific filters have protected all of our services from large attacks that would usually take down machines on other hosts. What's special about them is the fact that they have specific filters. They filter traffic specifically for the application / game you're running. Which is much more effective than what I've found at other hosts.The average response time for them to respond to a ticket is in most cases under 5 minutes. They are always hiring new staff to make the experience better for their clients. They've perfectly bridged the gap between being a large company and caring about each individual client.One thing that amazes my about this network is the fact that they care about each individual attack. On the rare scenario that an attack leaks traffic, that attack is patched within hours, where as other providers don't do anything about it. We've had hundreds of attacks up to 100Gbps hit our servers and nothing has happened. Their network has seen attacks of up to 1.6Tbps filtered without effect on the client, that's just amazing to me.Personally, I don't think I'll ever go back to another provider. This has been such a great experience for me, the staff care about the network and it's customers. I've only ever had one issue with my machine and it was solved in 10 minutes.For me, I would never use another service again. That's my take!"

I've been able to learn a great deal about the Information Technology industry by associating with new people.Furthermore I have a game server pushing 200 players on wipe because their services are well within underutilization; If I ever needed to move to a machine for that Rust server to grow further I'm confident it can be a fluid process because every shared service receives a unique IP in order for transitions to be made easily."
