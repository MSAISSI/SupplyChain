My request went through, and was rejected by the facility manager almost within 30 minutes, because it was being used for an internal event. My card was still charged for > $200, even though the space wasn't available in the first place. How can your design of your service be so unintuitive that you charge for services that the customer never receives? Why is that even a possibility in the software? Shouldn't the customer be charged AFTER the reservation request is approved? I want my money back, and I don't want to use Facilitron again."

Sun March 5, cancel 1st request to place request on an alternate school location (paid 30% deposit).  Facilitron did not fully refund the first deposit. Kept $50 for facility and $11.70 for processing fee!!! Really?  Not like I wasted their time considering/approving.  Very unfair. Chat person says it\u2019s the renter\u2019s policy.After 11 days, 2nd facility has not responded. We went in person 3/13 and spoke to principal and called and emailed the school\u2019s chief business officer 3/15 who was good to reply same day they will decline.  No reason given.  Principal did mention needing to hire custodian. But they haven\u2019t yet decline on Facilitron.This was for 1) FUHSD 2) MVWSD in Bayarea. We are still scrambling to find an affordable venue after waiting 10+ days.Update 3/16/23:Facilitron said FUHSD's policy is that every transaction has non-refundable $50.MVWSD will issue full-refund if I cancel.Refund is not automatic and must be submitted manually.  This is not apparent either.  So even though I cancelled 3/5, I was supposed to request refund manually.But the chat person was helpful and processed the 2 cancellations for me for refund.  She also cancelled the 2nd request because by now I am a little distrustful.So I'm increasing the 1 star to 2 stars.The price for rental is good, if it worked, but there is no certainty.  School reserves the right to cancel anytime.3/30 update. Facilitron refunded full amount which I\u2019m grateful. We ended up going with a private venue."

I also recently learned that internal comments can be seen by any internal user (all 250 users at my site) and that all internal users can view and comment on any internal request.  I was always under the impression that internal comments were for facilitron and site administrators.  I also figured users only had access to their own reservations.  Overall it works, but its not the easiest platform to use."

I don't mind the 1,939 Faciltron generated emails so far as I've set them to archive after 3 months. Many first and second time Internal users seem to need assistance with the website interface when creating reservations and often need a step by step walk-thru via email, phone, or in person to place their requests. I don't mind walking them through but I thought I'd mention it at this opportunity.I do not have that option to cancel a whole reservation so if an approved reservation user asks to cancel, I ask the user to make the cancellation themselves or have them or myself create a comment to have my Manager or Sophie and the Facilitron Team do so. The key is keeping the conversation in the Facilitron comments section and not in my emails or voicemails.We use the iCal on our interactive display panel instead of the HTML so that we can click on the daily view. It isn't as detailed as the Google Calendar view, the Google Calendar has a nice way of scrolling through events as they happen and have coordinating icons for the type of facility such as soccer balls for the Stadium and basketballs for Gym reservations."
