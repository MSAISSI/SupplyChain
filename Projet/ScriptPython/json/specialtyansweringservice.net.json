          "Contenu": "After spending a week trying to get access during our 2 week trial, we finally got it setup where we could start testing.   90% of our calls when straight to on hold music, after 5 minutes on hold it appeared to ring again then disconnected the line.    The calls that did manage to reach an agent, the agent couldn't answer basic questions that were in the script.   I called SAS to ask them about these issues and the response was simply \"It sounds like we are not a good fit\".    What company is a good fit for a call answering service that doesn't answer 90% of the calls, and the remaining calls that do answer can't response with the basic information?  Absolutely horrible experience. Stay away.Jason Taylor, CTO @ Dedoose"

This happened on many calls.The SAS office explained to me sometimes it takes a few minutes for the one answering the phone to receive the script on their computer she is representing. I lost many,many calls. I cancelled our service by phone and opened up the website to find no one cancelled my account. I went through a run around trying to cancel. We also were charged a whole month in advance and couldn't get our money back. If you value your customers and your business. DO NOT CHOOSE SAS!"

I had multiple patients complain about how calls were handled, the name of my business was regularly stumbled over or said incorrectly and the scheduling that was supposed to take place seemed to be too much for the receptionists to handle.  There were also multiple instances when the receptionist would keep the caller on the line for an additional minute or two while they were \"entering information\" only then to hang up with the caller without further interaction on the caller's part.  To me that practice seems questionable at best when calls are billed by the minute."

Our charity started using SAS when our other vendors could not handle the call volume, we had terrible long wait times and worse a lot of mistakes being made, BUT thanks to SAS all that is a thing of the past, my charity simply could not offer our services to our donors, volunteers, and our supporters with out them. We have great service, awesome operators that really care and most importantly we get so much good feedback about the calls. If you want top notch service we can not recommend them enough. Even for our Hour long telethon specials, thousands of calls it simple is no problem and my favorite thing about it all is that their staff is so east to work with and always is able to make adjustments whenever we need them! 5 Stars all the way!!"

We were all on call 24/7 for the better part of a week, and the fact that SAS could answer our phones for us 24 hour really saved the day for our employees and customers.SAS  personnel would immediately ask any callers if it was an emergency, and those that answered yes were hooked up with our on-call folks and most were visited by one of our team in less than an hour. This was critical, as we were dealing with frozen pipes, flooding, and all sorts of other issues during an unusual event like this.  With over 4,200 customers, one can only imagine how many calls SAS handled for us.Many thanks to all of the SAS team for helping us in this emergency! Our loyalty to SAS is huge!"

They provided me with help all along the way to make sure I was understanding what to do.We've now had SAS implemented for almost 4 months now, and I am continually impressed with the courteousness of the operators, the ease of getting my questions answered, and the flexibility that the SAS admin portal gives me. Any issues I've encountered have been easily addressed by tweaking the call scripts to make sure the operators know what to say.It has taken such a load off of us to know that our clients who call after-hours are being given correct information by a friendly live representative. I also love that our account rep Mollie checks in with me here and there to make sure I'm up-to-date on all the features in the portal.

          "Contenu": "I discovered SAS couple years ago when I was unhappy working with another answering service company. I talked to many answering service companies until then. They were either too expensive or they were not well established. When I called SAS, they took time to understand my needs and were quick to setup my account with my custom questions. Their pricing plans are very reasonable. All calls are tracked and reps who are answering the calls are very professional. After working with SAS about a year, I had to take a break for family reasons. Couple months ago, I resumed my business and called SAS right back! I am a returning customer and very pleased with them. I was up and running in one day and my calls were getting answered.Beside their professionalism, they have a great call tracking system.  It is easy to navigate, easy to customize and it even integrates with 3rd party applications which I love using it! I recommend SAS to anyone who is looking for a professional, knowledgeable, friendly, and effective answering service company. I want SAS to be the #1 answering service company because they deserve it!"
