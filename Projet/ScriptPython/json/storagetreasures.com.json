Sat there from 8 to 9 trying to call the property manager with no response. Went home and at around 12 noon i got a message asking me to call the same no. I had been calling. I called left another message and finally at 4pm spoke to the manager who stated that his boss put the unit back up for auction because he claims he never heard from me.

          "Contenu": "************** SCAMMERS  **************Avoid placing your trust in this inadequate business or its associated individuals. They engage in widespread scams, unabashedly going to sleep with clear consciences after preying on people. The units they auction often consist of leftovers, not items lost by others, as they prioritize personal gains. Bidder payments essentially fund the cleanup of the aftermath of their self-serving actions. Upon winning my first unit bid, filled mostly with empty boxes and odds and ends, I brushed it off as bad luck. However, my recent winning bid of over $300 for the largest 10x30 unit at this storage facility revealed an identical scenario\u2014empty boxes, odds and ends, stained clothes, and heaps of trash. Considering the monthly cost and deposit for a 10x30, it's perplexing that there wasn't a single valuable item. Why would anybody invest such a substantial amount of money on a monthly basis to store nothing more than discarded items ?In either case, I'm in the initial stages of filing a police report and submitting a complaint to the Better Business Bureau.Best of luck to all."

Also your contract states that you have 48hrs to complete your move, but you can only access the unit while the office is open from 9-6 so after 6pm you have to leave and return the next day. they will not give you a gate code so you can continue your move into the night.

I know I'm going to miss 10:00, so I call them at 9:30 and reschedule for 12:00. It's one of those days, so I am a little over halfway there and it's 12:20 and management calls me and tells me that if I'm not there by 12:30 then they're going to give the unit to the next highest bidder. The manager's tone made me feel like a burden. Like she didn't want to help me get what I'd paid for, but would if everything lined up perfectly (and I do wish my life would allow that). Funny how her store can stop answering the phone an hour early (and thus cost me 3 hours of driving) no problem, but God save us all if I am 31 minutes late to where she's already going to be. So I turned around, knowing I would be at least 10-15m later than 12:30, and not wanting to deal with this lady's tone nor attitude in person. She made an offer to the next highest bidder, and she got StorageTreasures to ban my account."

I have been doing this for some time now and every storage facility that I have dealt with has alway had some sort of conversation about the locker when collecting the cleaning deposit. This woman wouldn't make eye contact with me at all. She was looking to the side, asked me to sign the receipt and tossed me my $100.  This isn't the first time I had a locker that had nothing of value in it but it's the first one to appear to be staged. I will never buy a locker for this storage company nor would I suggest others to trust them. ThanksRich"

That same facility actually had the audacity to report my account and have it suspended and the Storage Treasures customer support sided with the facility. Once I finally had my account reactivated, the customer support had told me that I was not allowed to bid at that specific facility again. After that, I won an auction at a different facility that belonged to the same company and they permanently suspended my account claiming that I was banned from all facilities belonging to that company. I reached out to customer support with the email proof that this was incorrect and again was not helped by them at all. It's a shame that this company is so willing to completely ruin someone's livelihood over false pretenses."

How is this even possible? It's deception! All items have been rifled through and the most valuable things taken!We contacted StorageTreasures customer support and informed them about this situation. They replied that they won't do anything about it and will allow the same storage to be auctioned again.Based on this, buyers are completely deceived and the whole point of this 'game' is lost. How can you continue when you know everything has already been rummaged through before you? Very disappointed in the deceit from Public Storage and StorageTreasures!!!If this issue is not resolved soon and we are not contacted by a StorageTreasures manager, we intend to publicize this incident on social media platforms such as TikTok, Facebook, and YouTube.

I would suggest finding a way to monitor the bidding habits of accounts and IP banning those that are bidding up auctions and not buying or buying and not paying. While I understand this practice makes you more money and not taking action against it benefits you, I likely won't continue to look at auctions here if it continues.Pictures are often grainy and out of focus. There should be a review process to clean this up. In the age of smart phones with 5 cameras we shouldn't be looking at world War 2 era motion photos of a storage unit. Bidding and browsing feel chaotic and unprofessional for the above reasons. Things need to be more monitored and controlled.

If this is the case, I will accept the offer.  If the winning bidder entered into the unit, I will choose to not accept.Please advise.Due to no one being available, the offer lapsed.  I never did receive a reply on the email.  I would definitely have purchased the unit if it were available.  I was quite disappointed, especially given the lack of response and availability with the timing of the offer."

I called the 15th to see if I could come on the 16th(the deadline for cleanout) and the lady said she was much too busy and that wouldn't be possible, so I picked it up on the 19th(convenient for them) but a snowy/cold day for me. She didn't take a cleaning deposit, because they run on the honor system, aka, too much work to get it back to me after it's cleaned out. They need to hire someone more local to the facility to better service their customer's needs. The parking lot was a thick sheet of ice as well."

When we arrived at the office, the manager said that in order to withdraw the unit that we won, we have the right to enter only by truck and only once, and that no one will let us in our car and that it is written out in the rules of their company, although there is no such information on the site. It was a shame to spend my time and resources on this attitude to customers. Guys, be very careful when contacting Life Storage, because there is a chance you won\u2019t be able  to pick up your things."

There have been a few times I was 100 percent certain I know what I was buying and then when I pick up the locker the item I was going for is no longer in there.  Also don't understand why you can't sell the vehicles with the lockers?  Otherwise I would have given a five star review.  It's an awesome way to extra cash on the side and fun at the same time."

Also alot of the units look ran through as if someone has we ttheough them and took out what they want and then resold.  I've bought a few so far and I see that alot. Not sure what policy is but I believe no one should be allowed to go into and snoop through units other then customer and buyer."

After I opened the unit and moved some of the boxes, it was 100% trash. There is no way someone was paying to store that stuff there. It honestly looked like a bunch of leftover stuff from other units all shoved into that one. I say that because nothing matched. There were two miss match box springs, 1 wheel, a bunch of door handles and screws loose on the ground, 2-3 random baby toys (covered in oil from the floor of the unit), empty power tool boxes, an old exercise bike, 2 plastic chairs,etc. EVERYTHING WAS TRASH. Even a random bag of clothes was grease covered and ripped. I understand having bad luck with the smokers unit, but it would be nice if they mentioned that in the description. As far as the other unit goes, I feel like I got tricked because the boxes were covering all the trash underneath them. Maybe some better pictures and a little history of the unit in the description would be nice."

When I open the unit everything was gone but some tarps and the was another one of the facilities locks on the ground in the unit,  and it had been cut of by some one. So the issue I have with it was that the facility would have to known about the first lock being cut because they had put a second one on it. That say at the very least they knew the lock was cut off and they failed to let anyone know so that it could be taken down . And I am out the money I paid for the unit. Sucks"

          "Contenu": "Storage treasures in general is pretty decent and straight forward. To use the site on a mobile device can sometimes be infuriating because there\u2019s no easy way to go back to the search list I\u2019ve been looking at without having to enter the info in again and then scroll from the beginning. There\u2019s also something wrong with the zoom function that makes it very hard to see what\u2019s in the unit without having to rely on super tiny pics. The experience after winning a unit is hit or miss though. Some facilities are on top of their auctions and when you arrive, everything is good to go. The ones that aren\u2019t chain-stores I\u2019ve noticed tend to have way more issues including: not having change when you get there even though you have to pay in cash, getting the units mixed up, not being at the facility when you get there, etc.     Overall it\u2019s a fun experience but more like buying a scratch ticket than making an investment, because from the pictures you never really know what you\u2019re bidding on except a few items on the surface."

This was confusing because I thought it was already paid for on my card. I still had to pay a $100 deposit for cleaning which was fine. I just was not expecting to pay for the locker again. He said the charge would fall off in a few days. The specifics of paying should be on the winning notice page so I can print it and show it to the storage facility as proof. B. The guy behind the counter was very rigid in needing the auction number and my ID, yet he still could not find which storage locker # I won. Isn\u2019t the sale linked to the bidders name, phone, email,etc? Why was this so difficult and it seemed between waiting to get my locker # and waiting to collect my deposit I lost more than 30mins of my work day. NOT EFFICIENT.2. The specific # address of the facility was not on your site. It said \u201c Uhaul at Goldenrod road,Orlando\u201d. Your software should default not to accept inadequate addresses. There are multiple Uhaul on goldenrod road.  I lost about 20mins asking which Uhaul my win was at by having to stop, park,go in,wait in line,leave go 11 mins down the road etc.etc.This was not a good experience in terms of the logistics of your system. I wasted almost an hour of my day either looking for the facility or waiting at the facility for what was only a hand full of items. It may not be much time to some people, to me time is valuable as something you cannot get back so I hope you will review your process for address location entry as well as how your clients are trained to use your system."

I responded by asking wasn't that what ST should be doing? Holding their facilities responsible and accountable for their listing and photos? I was completely ignored and an answer was never given.ST does not seem to support their bidders as well as they should, just my opinion. But just as they receive $ from the facilities, I feel they receive mich more $ from their bidders, so I feel they should be more supportive and protective of their bidders. But in a fair manner, I'm not asking for them to do anything unfairly, but at least look into the concerns we bring to their attention. If they did so, made facilities provide photos that aren't blurry, make sure unit sizes are correct and check on shill bidding and why unit \"owners\" always manage to pay their debt within an hour of auctions ending. This happens at every facility 90% of the time an auction gets close to closing. Way, way too coincidental. ST tries to do a good job, but I feel they need to try and do a Great job."

Wish they would get this resolved. While I\u2019m glad to get a discount with my monthly membership, from a 15% buyers premium to 10% (it adds up) I still think the buyers premium is too high. But again, more auctions = more opportunities. So I use them a lot. I\u2019ve only had one bad customer service experience. They chose the storage facility over me. We are BOTH a customer, and I would like to be given equal ground. There are some unscrupulous storage owners/managers out there. Happy hunting!"

I understand the law behind this but don't agree. When you go to an auction, the item's now are up for sale. The resources on bidding with one unit are carefully scrutinized and to have it canceled.....please just hear this plee for a change somewhere in the system. Thank you."

If there was a way you could remedy that the access that they have to it then I would be much more involved in bidding on auctions. I found the lock they had drilled out in the far back of a 10x30 unit laying 30 ft away from the door Tell me how that happens."

I have had slight issues in the past that were cleared up on the spot with their chat feature which is super helpful. I have been told by storage facilities that calling customer service is a pain but I've never had to call. Obviously I will say paying the 15% buyer premium when you buy a locker is a burn on the wallet and I know I could buy a membership which would lower it the buyers premium but I just haven't made the jump."

Big Dreams Bigger nightmares! Totes filled w Christmas Halloween Easter.Jordan boxes stuffed with envelopes.Power tools with plugs cut off.Bed sets with no screws to put together.Washer and dryer that don't work.Refrigerators with old food in them. Lawn mowers always need repair they never startJUNK up to the ceilings!Very heavy furniture, sleeper couches that aren't worth anything you won't even let your dog sleep on them. Use sex toys a ton of that. Human waste yes believe it or not when people leave lockers behind they leave you a gift as well. I could go on and on and on. So basically you're cleaning out a storage locker most of the time it's what people leave behind on purpose meaning it doesn't have that much value to them. You might find something that you could use or even resell but after the expense of getting a truck guys hours of work to end up taking most of it to the dumpBe prepared for the worst keep your bidding low. Good luck \ud83d\udc4d"
