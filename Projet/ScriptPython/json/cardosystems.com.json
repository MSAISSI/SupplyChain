Month ago wife's one fell off, luckily with just some minor starches.Now, 2 days ago it fell of again on 100+ km/h. We were able to find it but it is not working anymore. Obviously, there is some malfunction on holding mechanism, because the other one is working perfectly. Of course, after first time that it fell off, we are double checking clips before every ride to be sure that we connected in correctly. I reached out to Cardo Systems, but they don't have interest in replacing it, they were event that rude to try to do upsell on me, trying to sell me replacement part for 190 Euros. Don't recommend it to anyone, really disappointed in the quality of the item, sound, and their customer service."

Cardo doesn't offer replacement batteries and will tell you to order a new unit.  Batteries can be obtained on Amazon, but you need precision electronic soldering tools and skills to replace it and system must be resealed.    We can't afford to spend hundreds of dollars every 3 or 4 years to buy new units because of crappy batteries.  Why can't Cardo make these units with easily replaceable batteries?Other than battery life, we loved the performance of the unit."

Back and forth for 3 hours and told to ship the defective unit back at my cost $18.00. Poor service that one phone call could have corrected."

(Edit) in response to cardos reply on your own website for the software update it specifically says to use the original cardo supplied cable... also I only purchased the cable from you cardo after I attempted 6 other cables on 2 different computers all of them would charge but none would allow the device to update... and just as a sanity check i checked them against an old phone and mp3 player all cables functioned normally for both devices.

Unfortunately and much to my chagrin, there is another problem. This time it's the reception of the radio stations, which is terrible.6 Preset station and none of them stay on station and gives a lot of static noise while listening to the radio as if there is no antenna.When the head is held up the reception is decent, but not good, but when I turn my head left, right, up or down, which you do constantly on the motor, the static noise takes over and there's only a solution, Command RADIO OFF, but this is not acceptable.After complaining to Cardo (Case No. C-00381329) I got a protocol from Cardo for troubleshooting, but after following the advised steps the problem is still there. Definitely not happy with Cardo."

          "Contenu": "I have a couple of Cardo Edges that my wife and I use, and have been recommending them to friends everywhere, as I believe they have been the best value.I believe this is no longer true because Cardo is going to a subscription model for their Custom series. The idea is you buy a basic unit to get into the ecosystem inexpensively, then upgrade it later. This does not sound like a bad idea, if it was a one-time fee, but my understanding is that it is NOT. It is a subscription, meaning that for as long as you want the extra features, you will pay FOREVER to have them. You could end up paying several times more than a top of the line unit would have cost. I'm sure that's great for Cardo's bottom line, but it takes advantage of folks who have less money, eventually charging them many times what a better unit (with all features enabled always) would have cost. Why not just charge for the difference, plus a small enabling fee, as a one-time charge? Cardo would still make more money than they would have had the customer originally bought the pricier model, and you'd have much happier customers.If you continue this subscription model, I fear you'll find a way to expand that to the rest of your lineup, so that people are no longer purchasing your product, but merely renting it. I'll quit on you long before you get to that point."

I emailed a few more times asking for the tracking number and/or if it shipped and I never heard back from anyone.   Then to my surprise the package was delivered a few days ago.  Last night I received an email with the tracking number but I already received the product.  Overall I\u2019m happy I received the product but the communication was  horrible and I was worried I would not be at the ship to location as I had no idea it shipped I have ordered many Cardo units and recommended these to everyone I snowmobile with.  Our Canadian dollar exchange rate is not good. To buy these it cost me an extra $220 to buy US money to pay for these as it takes $1.40 Canadian to buy 1 US dollar.  ThxJason"

          "Contenu": "Good evening,My name is Danika, my boyfriend and I are rider enthusiasts. He drives a Suzuki SV650 and has been wanting for a while to buy a Cardo system so that we could communicate on rides. We finally bought one a few weeks back and have only been having problems since. It took us over an hour to finally connect to the intercom system so we could talk and it would always disconnect after a few minutes so we stick to calling eachother on our phones instead. Anyways, that is not the main reason for this email. I think your design team should reconsider the clip in system for the Cardo. So instead of just the Cardo mounted to the bracket and the bracket to the helmet. It should all be one single unit mounted to the helmet. Because of a little clip it is so easy to loose it on a ride and that\u2019s exactly what happened. I was hugging my boyfriend, because I was sitting behind him on a ride and as soon as I turned my head around it flew off and hit my knee. We stopped on the side of the rode and searched the area for 2 hours. At the speed we were going it could\u2019ve ended up anywhere. So there goes $250 plus taxes down the drain. You would think with a product being so expensive that you guys would think of all the possible reasons for it to fall off and try your best to avoid it. Or simply by putting a Bluetooth component to it like the Apple airbud\u2019s have or the AirTags!Anyways all this to say that both of us are super disappointed and won\u2019t be buying again. Please reconsider your design as I would hate for another rider to go through the same thing.Danika"

That the next step is for me to ship my defective unit back to an address in either Hungary or Chicago, USA, and I have to send them a tracking number for that shipment.- I called support on the phone to finally get some clear answers, to find out if I am really supposed to pay for this shipment back out of my pocket, for a defective product that they failed to deliver in proper condition, only to have someone be absolutely rude to me while telling me that the steps are the same and that it in fact falls on me to pay this extra shipment fee.- Now, I'm left with a defective unit out of both my units (needed both as it is for my pillion and I).- I have to spend even MORE money just to finally get what I already paid for in the first place!?!I wanted to give them a chance every step of the way. I am extremely disappointed in this whole situation and company. I don't know what all the hype is about for Cardo if this is how the company does business.I will be returning my whole order (which I of course will have to pay shipment for out of my own pockets I have no doubt) and I will get a better product elsewhere with a company that hopefully has more integrity and care for customers."

My issue was kicked upstairs to tech and you took the easy route and charged me for a replacement. Yes , you gave me a discount, but when the bill finally comes in, it will cost me over CA $300 once exchange and import fees are included. Not happy. Not dealing with Cardo again"

Mine broke after about 10 thousand kms, over a total of 4 riding months, it was never ripped or treated poorly, but tucked in the helmet and covered in duct tape to hold it in place and avoid snags. Still stopped working, (like bad headphone cords, where they become position dependant if they emit sound). Anyways replacement is easy, and cheap, 10$ for a replacement, but shipping this thing, which is the size of a peanut and weighs the same amount, is going to cost me 25$, which brings the total to a unreasonable amount. Yes I live in canada, which means it is cross border shipping, but this is probably the highest I have ever paid for the smallest item I have ever shipped. That fact the microphone should not have broke in the first place really churns my butter. This sucks and I\u2019ll try and find a Chinese Alibaba equivalent when the microphone inevitably breaks again."

This is very difficult when there are no contact details and you\u2019re placed into a never ending loop and going in circles with no way out. Sent to messages via their Facebook page, waited for the past week and no response. In the end or excellent retailer swapped the microphone at no cost but the complete lack of support from Cardo is not acceptable. Would I buy another product from them. Short answer is no. Would I recommend them or their product. Again this is a no."

We adjusted the daylights out of the system for mic sensitivity and everything we can think of, yet the passengers Packtalk systems throw out so much static and keying of the microphone that all we hear is wind noise. It is so distracting and irritating that I usually turn my system off or ask the passengers to go on mute, which defeats the purpose of their units since they can\u2019t hear us with mute on, or even talk when they need to. I\u2019ve called Cardo and there is no fix to this. I feel we spent the extra money for the units that can\u2019t be used. I understand it could be the passenger sits higher, or they don\u2019t get the protection from the windshield, but there should be a software fix so they can participate in our conversations since that is what we intended. I\u2019ve bought bigger wind muffs on eBay, had them place the microphone under a neck gator, push their microphone up into their visors, but the passenger\u2019s system always ruin it for the rest of us because of the constant interruption of wind noise. I would hope Cardo reads this and can figure out how to tackle this problem because the passenger units are nothing more than paperweights at this point."

          "Titre": "Lack of communication",
          "Contenu": "The upfront experience ordering from the website was pretty simple and straight forward.  Unfortunately, that's where the good ends.  I received two emails following placement of my order, one to confirm receipt of order, and the second one included my invoice and informed me that a follow up email with a tracking number would follow.  After waiting 7-8 days, I attempted to reach out to Cardo and that proved to be quite the challenge.  After being on hold for approx 35-40 minutes the first call, I was just suddenly disconnected.  So I called back and waited another 30 or so minutes until I finally got a live representative.  The shortest version of this story is that I asked her for an order status update since I had not received anything since placing my order.  She informed me that due to the \"large sale\" that they recently had, all orders were delayed.  I explained to her that it would have been nice to have received an update email informing customers of such, to which she agreed should have been done.  She assured me that she was going to pass this on to the shipping vendor so that they could inform me when my shipment was sent.  Never received any follow up after that call.  Finally received my items on 6/7/23, and on 6/8/23 I received 2 emails to inform me that the items had shipped and they were on their way.  And just for clarity, I placed my order on 5/23/23.  I am not upset so much about the time it took to get my items, but more about the lack of communication and the difficulty in reaching someone to get a status update.  I believe that if you as a business know that both you the manufacturer and your shipping company are delayed due to the high volume of orders, you should at least send out a follow up email to those who placed orders and inform them of the delay.  At this time, I am not sure that I will be ordering from Cardo Systems again any time soon.  It is unfortunate because I really like their product, but not with this type of customer service experience. Respectfully,Marco E."

          "Titre": "Unfortunate product default; not taken seriously",
          "Contenu": "I bought a Cardo Packtalk Slim JBL duo package in December 2020. February 2023 (hence, 2 years and roughly 3 months later) my Packtalk stopped working. It was unable to charge, gave weird responses to the buttons I pressed, etc. Sparing the details: It probably short circuited due to a ride in the rain. I store my Cardo Packtalk Slim on my helmet, which is placed in a closet, away from direct sunlight, dust and in a room which is always between 18 and 25 degrees Celsius. Furthermore, I close the small rubber cap when not charging, to prevent anything from entering the connector. This Cardo had been used for approximately 9.000 km's (lets say that is about 100 - 180 hours). Since I had two devices (one on the helmet of my girlfriend, but she did not ride with me as often and since I am currently driving a lot (work traffic)), I installed the second Packtalk Slim on my helmet. This packtalk slim had only been used for approximatly 25 - 40 hours. I made sure to always update both devices and keep them charged when I did not use them for a few months. However, after a rainy day driving home from work, this one also short-circuited (or something, I'm not an expert). Weird noises, seemed to have a will of its own, buttons pressed resulted in different outcomes than they are programmed for, etc. This one however did still charge. I contacted Cardo Support to address the issue with both Packtalk Slims. They seemed to take me seriously at first, but pointed me to my expired warranty shortly after (2 years and 3 months, which is 3 months too long). Ofcourse a warranty date exists for a reason. I understand that. But considering my issues, the state of the devices (still good, maintained and one almost good as new), the claim that the product should be waterproof, my suspicion of the products being damaged by the rain, and it happening with both devices in very similar fashion, I simply do not understand the way they have handled the complaint. They seem to have no interest in the product default, preventing this issue from occuring with other costumers or products in the future, etc. While they told me they \"value my feedback\". The only thing they did, was offer me a 28% discount code. Replacing both devices (with low confidence in the products now...) with this discount code is still way to expensive for the money I already payed and the current prices of shops near me. A lot of family and friends drive with Cardo systems and had them for more then 5 (some even 8) years and never had issues. I do not complaint about me being unlucky and having a default, things happen. I complain about the way they handle it and care about the customer and the long-term product quality. I am now using my brothers Packtalk Bold, which works perfectly, but have to return it to him soon... Summarized: Product itself: 5 stars (both Slim and Bold)Product quality: 1 star (for the Slim)Customer service: 3 stars, they respond quickly and are kind. Problem solving: 1 star Long term interest in good products: 1 star"

Once I finally installed them, the speakers didn\u2019t fit inside my Shoie 1200 so I added the extenders so the speakers fit better and stayed in place and when I put the helmet on it hurt my ears because it kept scraping them. Then when I took the extenders out and just let the speaker sit in the speaker cut out my ears would still get caught and hurt, because the speakers are made of a hard plastic without any padding. I began to play music to see if the ear pain was worth the sound quality but the speakers were mediocre at best."

I know this doesn\u2019t really make any difference but I have been battling cancer and have had a lot of medical bills.

My first unit was purchased in 2018.  Had to be replaced in 2019.  I'm now replacing it AGAIN for the SAME issue in 2022, however this time it's out of warranty & I have to pay for the replacement.  Cardo has had FIVE years to work on this issue.... if the same thing happens again, I will not be buying another Cardo.  Check online & you will see this is a HUGE problem, many riders have had this happen.  Cardo also needs to come up with a strategy to change the battery once it is dead.  There are MANY complaints about that as well.  Their website (under FAQs for the Slim) specifically states that replacement batteries can be purchased through 3rd party vendors....BUT no one is allowed to replace them.  WHAT??*EDIT TO MY REVIEW*:  As promised in Cardo's response to my review, I received an email from Cardo & they have refunded my payment for a replacement.  THANK YOU, CARDO!!  Now for the test of time.... if this defect in manufacturing has been fixed, this unit should last a long time!  If it does, I WILL be buying another Cardo in the future.  Cardo's response to my review was swift & positive, renewing my faith in their company."

I click on the cart and see the two products.Now:I remove a product, but when I navigate to another page in the shopping cart workflow, the removed item reappears.Should:I remove an item and stale data in other tabs does not affect my current workflow.Cheers!"

While my helmet has speaker cutouts, the fit was too tight and the speakers hurt my ears.  I also had multiple issues listening to music.  I would be streaming Sirius from my phone using blue tooth, and it would repeatedly drop the signal and disconnect.  5 bars on the phone so it wasn't a cell reception problem.  Next, I downloaded a Spotify file to my phone and had issues playing that as well.  Most importantly, I discovered that using this system made the tinnitis a lot worse in my ear, both on and off my bike.  This, even after also wearing custom ear plugs, and keeping the volume at a barely audible level.I suspect that customer service could resolve the disconnect issues.  But since this aggravates my tinnitis, I have now removed it from my helmet. Perhaps Cardo should include a disclosure telling potential customers that using the system could aggravate persons with tinnitis. It's not really their problem.  It's mine.  An expensive lesson learned."

I am a big Cardo fan and have recommended them many times. I don't expect Cardo to be responsible for UPS problems, but without a shipping confirmation or tracking number so I could see the progress/delays, it makes the purchasing experience painful. Given the quick shipment, adding a couple stars."

In the verge of breaking. So bought 2 more. Took forever to find where to order and I tried looking again and can't find it because what I got were such short cords I'd have to put my helmet in top of the wall plug to charge them so they're somewhat useless. I did get them quickly and the price was good. I still need longer cards or the whole charging unit that has a linger cord tho that cord isn't really long enough either. But it's better than my 2nd purchase. This cord plug that goes I not helmet needs to change to one of those round type as this type breaks.  I had same cord for a cheap rechargeable spotlite that also broke in same spot. Needs to be more heavy duty."

          "Contenu": "I got the packtalk edge. It is my first helmet speaker/communication system. I figured I would spend the extra bucks to get the best quality I could find; however, I was disappointed. The unit works just fine, but it is way overpriced. The bass is minimal. The volume would need to be way too high to register any bass. This might be the case for all helmet systems not just cardo, but this is my first so I have no reference to compare to. I left my unit to charge over night and the port flap is now slightly bent. It wouldn\u2019t close all the way which isn\u2019t a problem unless it was to be used in the rain. I was able to apply heat to reshape the flap and get it closed again, but I shouldn\u2019t need to do that. I would assume this is just be a defect of my unit.The talk quality is good! Very easy to hear people talking. The \u201chey cardo/siri\u201d feature was very frustrating for me. It works perfectly when standing still but once in motion, the unit could not understand me. The mic was positioned close enough to my mouth that I could touch it if I puckered up a bit, so I think it was positioned as intended. Updating the unit was very easy and intuitive. Attaching it to the helmet was easy enough. The battery life seems to be very good. After about 2 hours of riding the unit was still essentially fully charged. Again, the units works fine for the most part, but for the price I would rather just keep using one airpod. I will be returning my unit."

Not being able to buy covers for the speakers inside my helmet is a big problem to me.

After installing the unit on the helmet I discovered that it functioned as well as anticipated with telephone calls.  The volume and quality of signal from the radio for voice and music was better that Harley Davidson by a long shot but could still be louder to be able to compete with pipes at highway speeds above 70 mph.  Have not taken the unit on an extended ride so I cannot comment on the units performance over an extended period (battery life & connectivity overall)."

I hang back about 100 yards from the other riders to let the dust settle and the cardo is constantly disconnecting and connecting communication between riders. It's supposed to work for .75 miles but when we got over 100 yards or so it didn't work well. I guess the Bluetooth needs line of sight for connection and mountain dirt roads aren't exactly ideal. It works great on road since we can close the gap."

Even if I DO eventually get them positioned properly, the biggest joy I have in riding is listening to music on my sealed ear buds.  I'm a professional musician and I love the clarity as well as the bass frequencies I get from a closed/sealed in ear bud.  I'm really surprised Cardo doesn't connect to blue tooth ear buds, since it's such a wireless based system.  I'm still experimenting, but so far I'd say going from my sealed ear buds to these separated speakers has been a serious downgrade to my riding experience.   Other than that...the rest of it works really well."

For the future, We don\u2019t like service in subscription, we are Cardo customers, we have three set of helmets (touring, enduro, jet) and we prefer to be free, pay for buying it, but not to pay for a mandatory service.(We are from Italy, and for me using Siri is a mess, every time I say \u2018yes\u2019 (SI in Italian) it\u2019s start the SIRI fuctions and for 10-15 seconds I can\u2019t communicate\u2026 to be improved\u2026 or I need to change language:-)"

I feel as if it would take a long time to get used to using all of the controls and features. Will have to study them off the bike for all them to be useful for me. A voice activated radio scan feature would be nice too. Other than that, top notch product."

Without question, the Edge outperforms the 50S in every respect: connectivity, ease of use, sound quality, versatility (I don't need peripheral units that I do for some functions with the Sena), reliability and customer service, to name some criteria that are important to me. I have the Sena only for when I know that I will be riding and wish to connect with others who have Sena units. When I make the switch, I can't wait to return my Edge to its place on my helmet."

The G4 was a game changer for us, no longer was our rider/passenger conversation initiated by a slap on my helmet, or a vague hand signal. That first 1800 mile ride with Cardo made all the difference in the world, long days on the road, were made more enjoyable, listening to music, talking about the road, sharing directions, planning stops, not to mention the safety of always being informed of what the others on our road trip were doing or planning, for bathroom breaks or gas stops. My wife and I just recently returned from a 3000 mile loop from San Diego CA to Wheatland WY and back, I can\u2019t even imagine that 10 trip without our PackTalk Bolds I have been a Cardo user of many products, I have used the G9, G9x, PackTalk, and now PactTalk Bold, each version gets better than the last! DMC was a huge upgrade for us, since I offer ride with 8-10 riders it\u2019s made adding other riders and communicating with the group seamless. I can\u2019t wait to get my hands on the PackTalk Edge, I know it will not disappoint.See you on the road! -George"

And we have our two boys as pillions.We upgraded to G9 and the intrecom between all 4 got better. But still when loosing connection to my wifes bike, it had a hard time reconnecting all 4 units.After uppgrading to PackTalk Bold it's work like champ.Yes we still loose connection when we drift a part to far. But as soon we are in reach again, they reconnect always.I've not been in need to use any service or support from Cardo, so I cant't say anything about that.I love our PackTalks, but not everything is great.Two major issues as I see it. The RDS Radio is crap, at least in Sweden. I listen to Spotify through my phone instead. And I might miss some valuble traffic information.And the other issue is the connections to the other major brand of intercom, Sena.And this is not Cardos problem alone, but the day when Sena and Cardo can agree on a standard the let ANY brand easily connect, that will be the day...OK, you can connect to Sena riders through bluetooth, but then you are back 10-15 years in the quality of the connection. You loose all the great feaures."
