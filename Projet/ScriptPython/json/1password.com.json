          "Contenu": "1Password is an absolute trash piece of software.  It is filled with glitches, totally inconsistent in performance, and will slow you down interminably when you try to access previously hassle-free websites.  Be prepared to reset your passwords constantly in the hope that 1Password will eventually recognize one of them and use it consistently.  Customer Support is virtually non-existent.  They can't explain or resolve any of these reported issues.  They simply offer you three free months of usage in the hope that you can figure it all out on your own.  Do NOT, repeat NOT, waste your time trying to use this software.  It will leave you more frustrated and angry than you can imagine.Post Script:  The response from 1Password below this post is a total smokescreen.  They control this website and will delete any posts that are critical of 1Password.  All of the info requested in their response had already been provided to 1Password.  This included (at their request) a detailed list of issues/problems encountered with the implementation and usage of the software.  1Password's response?  An email that advised that they had closed my account.  No attempt whatsoever to resolve the multiple problems and issues.  As I stated before, do NOT try to use this flawed software.  It will give you nothing but grief."

          "Contenu": "1Password refused a negligible account credit refund request, despite having the discretion to fulfil it.I have no qualms with 1Password crediting an account, where applicable. However, if a customer requests a refund of their hard-earned cash, which is likely the exception rather than the rule, 1Password should do the right thing by the customer.In September 2023, 1Password announced it had surpassed $250 million in annual recurring revenue. Holding on to negligible $$ during a 'cost of living crisis' is just bad for customer experience.Update (15/12):Just to respond to the below comment, there is no suggestion here that 1Password have refused to credit the account(s) automatically. As noted above, this is in relation to a credit-refund, which has been refused.With 4 (soon to be 6) Business Accounts, and 2 Personal Accounts, I'm not perceiving any \"billing event\" or \"account-level change\"; which basically means 1Password will sit on my hard-earned cash for the remainder of eternity.1Password's refund policy states: \"We\u2019re unable to issue refunds for past charges or for any time remaining on your account at the time of cancellation\". However, I have cited to them an instance of them already doing this for myself on another account. Furthermore their Terms of Service states:\"While all amounts paid are non-refundable, certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by AgileBits Inc. on a case-by-case basis and granted at the sole discretion of AgileBits Inc.\"So in this case, 1Password has the discretion to be able to honor my request, and deliver a positive customer experience, they're just choosing not to.Thus, poor customer service experience - 1 star."

It is just a bunch of junk at that point, and talks about what you could have done to recover your account.fix this by actually putting yourself in the shoes of someone who is locked out.  Fix this by putting the person's password in the recovery kit that they should save, instead of having that part blank for them to fill out themselves.  Fix this by allowing multi-factor recovery like phone number, or separate device/phone auth allow.  Multi-factor app like authy/authenticator should also be a method of recovering an account. Show the password to the person as they are changing their password, so they can see misspellings. They can also screenshot their password for saving in the cloud as part of the backup.BE MORE CLEAR that if they mess this up then they will hate you because you can't help them recover.I almost had to delete my account and start over again.  I was just trying to change my 1password master pass to safeguard my details, and I almost lost my account.  NOT COOL.It makes me want to stop using your service.

          "Contenu": "Update: Although the customer service is responding to the 1 star reviews, there is no indication that 1Password resolved the issues.  I also filed a BBB complaint and Econsumer.org complaint (because they are not US based).  Those are the type of things that get responses so I encourage anyone else having an issue to do the same. Review: Yesterday I migrated all my data from LastPass to 1Password because 1Password comes so highly recommended.  I deleted my LastPass account upon migration of my information to 1Password.  This morning I did a factory reset of my Macbook Air and opened Safari to log into 1Password.  I entered my username and password.  But 1Password does not recognize my Mac - and wont let me sign in without my security key! So because of a bug in their system, I\u2019m completely without access to all of my important data.  I can't access any of my email accounts today.  I had appointments booked on online platforms I can\u2019t access.  I am missing work.  I can\u2019t even communicate with anyone about why I'm missing work, because I\u2019m unable to get into ANY accounts.  I\u2019ve reached out to customer support all day with no response.  I finally resorted to contacting them on twitter - no response.  I Password is preventing access to information I need for day to day, minute to minute, living.   I missed work today.  I\u2019m missing emails from clients.   And no response at all from the company.Update: It\u2019s now 10:00 pm.  Customer service ignored my communications all day leaving me unable to work (online platforms).  I do not use a smart phone.  I use a light phone (the dumb phones that barely call and text).  So I had literally no way to recover access to ANY account all day.  I am a freelance worker.  My income depends on fast responses to customer requests.  My ratings and reviews on freelance websites are calculated based on how quickly I respond to customer requests.  So while 1Password has chosen all day to ignore my communications, I have lost both clients and ratings. I have several screenshots showing unanswered communications with 1Password on their social media."

There is no support, every time you click on a button it just open another pop up with impenetrable instructions on how to migrate an account, it is utter rubbish.I have just been asked to provide more information on this review by Trustpilot on pain of the review being taken down. I am very happy to offer more information but the reply does not allow more data to be provide so I will put it here. I have been using Password 1 for many years, however it has always been very clunky and not user friendly (I am a Mac user and I expect things to work without having to have an understanding for the operating system or be a programmer). Recently I was told by Password 1  that version 7 would cease to work and I needed to migrate to version 8 (I had already tried to move to version 8 previously but gave up trying). That migration process is insanely complicated, the advice is badly written, the links on their webpages just simply don't take you to where you need to be, the whole process is opaque. Eventually I have now managed to set up version 8 but entirely by chance - I have not idea how it worked or whether all my data has been transferred. Furthermore, I now seem to have two accounts with slightly different data. The whole thing is an utter shambles. Finally there is no obvious route to find support. If you click on the support links  it simply takes you to the opaque instruction you started at in the first place. In the past I raised a query with their support team, when they could not help me they simply closed the ticket.What I should have done it written down every password I have and used the browser password systems instead. I have no confidence that when I next long in to Password 1 any of my data will still be there.UPDATE 26 June 2023Since I managed to upgrade to Version 8 I now get a pop up in Firefox saying that the Password 1 add on does not work. I raised another ticket with Support and they responded, \"1Password is unable to function in Firefox if you set the browser to \"never remember history\" or \"always use private browsing mode\". These options prevent all add-ons and apps from saving, collecting and accessing data in the local storage, and 1Password can't work correctly without accessing data in the browser cache. Unfortunately this is a browser limitation.\"So Password 1 are recommending leaving one of the main doors to cyber security, your browser history, unlocked and wide open. UTTERLY ASTONISHING"

Additionally, there should be a way to right click or long tap a suggested password so you can go right into it in 1P and modifiy it.  My import of credentials resulted in tons of duplicates (average of 2-3 per entry) and there is no simple deduping process in the app.  Now that apple added password sharing via KC, I'm starting to think I should have stayed on the apple KC...

I'm fairly tech-capable and I already use another password manager.  The 1password setup process is tortuous which on the one hand is impressive for security,  but on the other hand tricky to navigate.   The good news is the 1password android app appears to have completed the setup process and be working fine.  Both the android app and my other password manager confirm that I have the secret key and my master password stored correctly. But the firefox and chrome extensions intermittently will not let me sign in to 1password despite multiple checks and copying and pasting my secret key and password during the attempted sign-in process from its storage in the 1password android app and also from my other password manager..Ditto the windows app which persistently tells me I have either or both my secret key and my password wrong.  Just in case it might be a problem with my PC,  I've also tried the installation on a second windows laptop,   and also with my firewall temporarily disabled.  Still no joy.   I'll await support's response.  For clarity,  I have not used 1password  for any passwords yet,  as until I can successfully sign in properly,  I cannot import any passwords from my other password manager."

          "Contenu": "I see a good number of issues with the support I got:1. Agents changed quite regularly. I got about 3-4 agents over about 10 messages. This meant that new agents had to get up to speed, may not understand the issue very well, and have different focuses, which caused the approach to vary each time they changed. Not a good, contiguous support experience. 2. Agents made broad statements about my account state without explaining how this affected my account state or influenced my path forward. Essentially, they provided information I couldn't use as presented. 3. Agents uniformly focussed on the \"next step\" and confirmation of details that sometimes other agents already confirmed (see number 1, above), and were not focussed on my goal, so their approaches, uniformly, were much more complicated than they needed to be. It may be their responses were somewhat scripted, which could explain it.4. The wait between replies was not conducive to getting the issue rectified in a timely manner. I think I spent 3 days on this.  Should have taken 2 hours max. 5. Ultimately, I figured it out myself, as I got so frustrated with circular responses and waiting, that I tried some things and hit on something that worked quickly. Wish I'd just done this earlier. Support didn't really do anything for my immediate issue. They did, however, send me a link to delete a derelict account. The one thing that I found helpful, I guess. I added one star because the support staff were friendly, and seemed to want to help. Just couldn't, very well.PS. I see 1Password had a reply. No, sorry, you're twisting my words. If you read my post, the support staff were absolutely UNABLE to help. But they were friendly. I figured it out myself after waiting a long time."

And on iPhone, I cannot scroll through the list, just \"pin\" recently viewed, recently created.. etc..You want to know a cruel irony?  I cannot post this review because I cannot get to my passwords on 1Password8 (passwords updated) without entering the passkey.   I don't know how.. but I recovered it.

Apparently 1password knows about the issue, and the workaround is to import the CSV file using the browser version, but they have yet to respond to the folks having issues with it and let them know that's a possible solution.  Support should make this known to all their new users.Finally heard from 1Password and they are aware of this problem.  They're trying to fix it, but it would be nice if they let people know about it immediately and provide the workaround.Changed review to three stars."

Then downloaded installer asks for a password but the user name didn't make sense. No combo of user names and password (Apple, 1Password) worked.

My next concern was the ease of a replacement. Especially, for my wife\u2019s using it. (She and I both have post Master\u2019s level college degrees. However, us 76 year olds have not concerned ourselves very much with keeping up with the latest computer tech other than what we have to.)With that in mind I chose DASHLANE because of its user friendliness. However, the determining factor in choosing 1Password over DASHLANE was the attention to security.However, the lack of guidance of a knowledgeable living person by 1Password is still frustrating me and I am STILL trying to sort through sharing the MASTER PASSWORD for accessing certain personal information that relates to both of us!  Also, I\u2019ve just learned that our bank is not aware of 1Password or, therefore, what I need to do to use 1Password with my accounts. I\u2019m having to log on manually. I am physically disabled so it\u2019s difficult to visit our bank and it\u2019s 20 miles away. I suggest you consider that a niche market?I also suggest 1Password consider the senior adult market! There are millions of us and we would welcome a dedicated line to a live 1Password person for guidance in setting up an account. I fully realize the challenge and that it would take people who have the communication skills for it.I look forward to learning to use a pass key with 1Password. But, I have my concerns about how we would have passkeys always with us on our persons.I am greatly encouraged about 1Password. Frankly, I am concerned about Canada\u2019s political situation. Your leader seems to be willing to take control of anything he decides to. That makes me wonder about the future true security of my/our personal data."

Confusing, better direction needed because you need to install app first.2. Where is the app to download? Apple app store has ipassword 7, I was pretty sure there is 8, is it available, where to get it, did something happen with Apple, 7 is an editors choice??? For me a google to finds the download for ipassword 8, and I download. I'm a developer so I get to the next step. Do I trust where I'm downloading from a search(? not really). All concerning and not clear,  as I trust y'all with with my passwords!3. Getting installed on all my browsers confusing requires changing my default browser. Again love the idea that y'all have the automatic download from the app link figured out for my default browser. But I want it installed in all my browsers, I realized I can hack it by changing my default browser the clicking the link.Props, good job making all this work. Some care went into making it easy. But now there is more to improve. I've got my entire family, sisters, and mother now using, I'm a software developer so I can figure this stuff out, but many in my family would be lost trying to get things started, and they are still challenged to use it. No question 1password is so much better than the alternative!"

I do have the 1Password for Safari installed, but in the prior version of 1Password, I saw two extensions in the Safari settings: 1Password and 1Password for Safari.

I submitted a diagnostic report regarding import problems as I was starting to use 1Password and the response came 3 days later.  I had better response time later, with one same day response, and 2 next day responses.  Perhaps I just hit a bad time with the 3-day response, but even next day is frustrating when one is in the middle of trying to solve a problem.  The original 3-day delay resulted in a month's delay in using 1Password as I had no windows of available time again to work on the problem.I will say that some of my problems were user errors as perhaps I was trying move too quickly, but they were not likely totally untypical errors.  I moved from another password manager which felt more intuitive, but it may be simply because I had used it for many years."

I recently discovered my version of 1Password is being discontinued and that I needed to move to a subscription based version (8). The migration was relatively simple but there are two things worth mentioning. Firstly don't expect to be charged straight away (as I did) as you are automatically entered into a 14 day trial period. After which you are required to make payment to get full use of the service. Secondly be mindful of the 1Password site you use when (and if) you need to access 1Password via a web browser (perhaps to set up your subscription). You have 3 choices 1Password.com, 1Password.eu, & 1Password.ca. Choose the same one you chose when setting up the 1Password apps else your secret key and username will not be recognised. One other observation - 1Password 7 (the now superseded version which you will be replacing) does not provide you with a Secret Key so don't waste time looking for it (only version 8 provides a Secret Key). I have to say I was very impressed with the email support I received from 1Password representatives Alex, Paul & Jenn. They were very polite, encouraging, knowledgeable and timely - a credit to 1Password. Thank you. Carl"

Pros:Since the day I subscribed to it, and that's pretty good money for a private person like me, I haven't had a single problem, either logging in or registering, and not a single password has been stolen. The software on Windows is excellent with no bugs. It serves its purpose wonderfully, and so far I have not found a single difficulty. The support service is unparalleled, especially the chat feature, which I appreciate so much with companies as it makes it easy to get a quick response. I thank the staff from the bottom of my heart.Cons:It's a different story on Android, but I don't work with the phone much. The autofill function sometimes works to not at all. This only happened when I did the new (big) update. Conclusion:I recommend anyone who values their accounts and is on the internet a lot, opens a lot of accounts, to buy 1password. It is definitely worth it!Greetings from Austria~M.HEDIT: I found a solution how you can solve the auto-fill problem on your Android phone. You have to delete the data and the cache of the app and then reinstall it. Then it should work. At least it worked for me."

Couple of days ago I've bit the bullet and decided to upgrade to the subscription model, in the cloud. This means more money every year, so I've thought of reaching out to their customer support team and see if they'd be kind enough to offer me a small discount to start me off. Not only they've answered in less than 3 hrs, but they were also so incredibly generous, they almost left me out of words... I knew their support rocks and they care for their customers, but didn't expect this level of appreciation and commitment! Kudos! Other companies out there should be inspired by you...Many many thanks again, and please keep up the good work to keep us safe and secure - I'm certainly grateful for that!"

I always tell them that I have more than 300 logins because many people I know use a notepad that is very scruffy and has many logins also. They know that they need to do something better but they are hesitant to go with anything that is on their computers. They think that a notepad is more secure. I am still working on some of them and I have offered to help them to install the app. I have convinced my wife and she now has a 1PW account and loves it.I recently updated from version 7 to version 8 and it behaves perfectly. I like Two-Factor Authentication and I just like knowing that my critical accounts are well cared for and well protected. The interface is a pleasure to work on and does not require a huge effort to use. Support respond quickly and provide thorough answers. I feel a little embarrassed to ask some questions but the support team are happy to answer any and all questions with understanding and go the extra mile with screen shots and markups when needed. I feel much more comfortable with the product knowing that the support is excellent.Keeping accounts safe has become even more important as the Internet is ubiquitous now. No longer is it accessed only by the techies. There are the good, the bad and the ugly out there but I know that my accounts are in safe hands with 1Password (1PW). Just a day ago I had reason to ask about the version number info on 1PW and I got a detailed response. I also asked about a test account I used to test how version 8 worked and again I got a clear response. The same for 2FA - Two-Factor Authentication logistics and using IDs instead of email addresses. All great replies. On any application I use, support is key requirement for me. I have been employed by companies in the high-tech world all my life and was manager of a support team so I know what it takes. I highly recommend 1Password as you can tell."

In the process, I lost several applications, including 1Password.  As I started over, I found several settings had been changed, making it nearly impossible to accomplish anything.  I needed several calls to Apple support in addition to several to 1Password.  The 1Password staff were consistently patient and helpful and confident they would be able to help get a new app installed and working again. They made several suggestions that proved to be valuable.  That was especially helpful as I was often near tears and sure we would never get it working again.  In the end, they were successful. And I am grateful to them for their patience with my struggles and ignorance and their competence."

This time around, however, I decided to change from a 'single license' (using Dropbox.com) to a 1Password 'membership'.WOW... installing the software via the membership AND automatically migrating my data (password records) into the latest 1PW version was a breeze.   1PW's customer support was EXTREMELY RESPONSIVE (they replied within minutes after posting a question in their Q&A forum).  Specifically, Courtney Hallstrom provided fantastic customer service addressing many questions of mine (e.g., data migration, sync configuration, billing, etc.)I really liked 1PW's single license... HOWEVER, I LOVE 1PW's latest way of having access to my valuable password records from anywhere while securely protecting all my data... I highly recommend 1Password!"

Very repsonsive, and patiently talked me through the issue.  Turns out that I've been using the service for so long that their entire business model and technology platform has changed, and no longer supports my setup.So I now need the latest version of the software, and can no longer use Dropbox to store my vaults and share between multiple devices. I now need to move onto their subscripion model.While disappointing, I can hardly complain after so long.To soften the blow, they offered me 3 years subscription at 50% off, something which I suspect is standard for long term users migrating to the subscrption model.  Even so, it helps a lot to make the transition, and the truth is that it's such an awesome platform that it feels like a very reaosnable cost for the peace of mind and easy logins/form filling it offers."
