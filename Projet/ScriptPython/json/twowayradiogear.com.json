About two months ago one radio had an issue with the communicate button on the side and stopped working.  We reached to Two Way Radio Gear several times and Joe did not return calls. We finally spoke with Joe and went over warranty coverage and sent the pictures he requested.  We waited weeks and did not hear back from Joe regarding next steps.  We called today and asked for a supervisor and were directed to Erin who said she was a customer service supervisor.  She apologized and promised to mail us a new radio today when she had a tracking number that ours was being returned to them.  We were waiting for the tracking email and Erin called back and said she could not do that now.  We had to pay and go through Motorola.  This company has horrible customer service, no follow up on warranty calls and then promises something they cannot do.  Our 17 facilities will find a new company to purchase our radios."

In calling back to complain about this, I come to find out they have a Canadian website...1) If you have a customer telling you it's being shipped from the US to a Canadian address, why don't you ask if they're aware of the Canadian website?2) Nowhere on their website does it mention that they have a Canadian website... this information would be helpful for this exact scenario.3) While I understand that anything travelling from the US to Canada has to go through customs, this company need to make it very clear that either a) Brokerage is included in the cost of their shipping or b) Additional brokerage fees will apply.Their website and customer service lacks basic information to best serve the customer. We will not be ordering from them again."

          "Contenu": "Radios seem to be good quality.  When I talked with the rep, I specifically said I needed to access channels one and two for each specific school site. I was told that they were being programmed. When I received the radios they had bleed over from another set of radios in the area due to these channels being \"generic Motorola\" channels. I was told to use a higher channel (like channels 8 and 9).  This does not lend itself to ease of use and not acceptable in my mind given what I paid for the two way radios with programming. I was given two options 1) send the radios back so they can be programmed or 2) send me a cable so I can program each of the 17 radios I purchased to which I would be charged $35 if I did not return the cable.  Seriously?  What is my time worth?  What will it cost for me to have my tech guy come in and do this billing me for his time alone?  The radios seem fine and of good quality. Not sure about the customer service nor \"programming\" that came as part of the package. Two way radios that come with generic channels that have bleed over, nor get the weather channel do not seem like they have been programmed. And, NO, I am not boxing them up to send them back. If they are going to charge me for a $35, I can only imagine who will pay the shipping for sending them all back?"

Very poor webaite design in my mind if it cant calculate basic shipping costs."

I did buy two more sets because we need them.  We are an elementary school and cannot really afford to buy the most expensive radios.  I do believe they should last longer than they did."

So I talked to Benny and he said to just send them back with one of ours and they will Re-Program the radios to the Readers. The problem is he said that I will have to pay for the radio's to be shipped back to your company, I already paid over $800.00 for them plus another $30.00 to send them back. We have 8 maintenance staff members on hand plus 3 office workers and they all require using the radio's. I will have to think twice about my next order with you, our radio's are 5-6 years old so I'll be looking to purchase other radio's but not if it's going to cost me more money. Sorry this is so long but I had to tell someone about what happened. Thanks Tom Bailot, Facility Director"

They worked with us to ship and program very quickly in a limited window.\r I would have rated 5 stars except we had a programming issue which seemed to come from a minor communications glitch.  Both Two Way Radio Gear and I accepted our mutual responsibility with the error and plan to have it corrected in the near future.\r I will continue to use Two Way Radio Gear, I see them and their sales manager as a very honorable, reputable business."

In the initial conversation to find a solution, it was stated that this was on us and that we would have to pay for the return shipping for your company to pair to one of our existing walkies. In the following discussions, we were able to determine that we had informed the sales representative when making our purchase that we had existing walkies. For that reason, all cost that were inquired were taken care of and the turn around time on receiving our walkies back was very impressive. When our walkies were returned to us following the first reprogramming there was one walkie that was sent back that was still not operational and we did have to go through the process to send it back again. This provided an added stress to our school as we utilize our walkies for security purposes and it put us at an added disadvantage having to send in a walkie to pair it to twice. With all that said I rated the 4 Stars because of the response time and turn around when working with the customer service team. I would recommend purchasing products from Two Way Radio Gear to friends and colleagues."

Since I was asked to get some radios to match others we already had (and I know nothing about them) I really needed their help and guidance. Brian even caught a mistake my IT department made when providing me info on what to get so they would work together. I would say he definitely went out of his way which was fantastic on top of the companies good prices.  Usually they say you get what you pay for but with these is purchase I got so much more!!"

I gave him the two model numbers and he asked how the radios were going to be used and other important questions .Then he explained that the Motorola Mag one BPR 40 would be good fit for our Crane Operators to use!He sent me more info than I had requested ! I sent him several e mails with more and more questions and about cost !He always replied promptly and even called me twice to follow up and make sure there was anything else i needed to decide on mu order!My Owner changed his mind 3 times and Josh never got fustrated he just kept sending me what i needed to get my Owner to see what he really wanted and all the diffrent offers! Have to say we did get price quote from 2 other Radio suppliers and Two - Way Won hands down !!Not only in price but customer service and prentation Glad I called them! Josh is AWSOME!  Will highly recommend them! 5 STAR !!!! Thank you !!! For Being AWSOME ! In this day and time thats a rare thing!!!   Thank you! Longos Mechamical ! Robin."

          "Contenu": "If I could give 10 Stars to Two Way Radio Gear, I WOULD! They are the epitome of professionalism and expertise. They understand how business gets done and conduct themselves in a manner that is optimum for their customers as opposed to just themselves.They offer a demo program that allows potential clients the opportunity to trial FULLY working radios in the field to verify that the coverage areas extend to where they need it. The pricing is completely justifiable to even the most cost-conscious CFO, and the nation-wide coverage (yes, I took the demo units all over the country, from east to west coasts and points in between) is a boon to companies such as ours that have projects far and wide.And I would be remiss if I didn't mention the excellent customer support - I had a question at 5:15pm on a Friday evening and was able to get Tony on the phone to walk me through the portal and reactivate a radio that I had screwed up the programmable features on. That is service above and beyond.I wholeheartedly recommend Two Way Radio Gear to all my subs and to anyone who needs PTT service that just plain works without the hassles of FCC license filings and/or constant frequency reprogramming of multiple radios."
