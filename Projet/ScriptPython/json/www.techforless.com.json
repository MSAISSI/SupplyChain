          "Contenu": "Ordered a $1,600 television from these guys in open box condition (Samsung The Frame). Got the television and get this, it's missing THE MAIN CABLE that makes the television work. And also the REMOTE CONTROL. Like, not insignificant things, these are things that are absolutely criticalThere's no excuse for these to be missing, but it's clear that nobody in their company is doing an ounce of quality controlThese guys are also unreachable on the weekend. I'm now out the cost of an installer since they made the trip to come install the TV, will have open walls for several days now until this gets rectified and I get the missing cableAt this point I'm concerned about these guys even supplying the missing items, either in a reasonable timeframe or potentially at all. Hence the \"borderline\" scam. Will keep folks posted, but as the saying goes \"What's cheap ends up being expensive\""

They refused to help at all and I am currently disputing with my credit card. Their shipping also leaves something to be desired because if you don't pay extra they deliver at the end of your driveway, even if your house is a half mile down the road and its raining. Pay the extra with someone else and don't deal with this hassle."

It is getting worse and worse. I rate the customer service of Tech For Less as insufficient. My contact person was Jessica H. As of today; I am not satisfied with the after-sales process due to my perception:1. I found the telephone and written communication to be lengthy, irritable, and occasionally implicit.2. E-mails remained partly wholly unanswered.3. I did not feel welcomed at customer services. I do think that Tech For Less should work on these issues. ____________________________________________PS: To answer the reply from Tech For LessOn March 27, I submitted my view based on the assumption that the flaw will not worsen. At this moment, I was satisfied with our negotiations. However, my most recent attempts to contact Tech For Less remained unanswered. Despite several tries. I perceived our telephone conversation as inadequate. Occasionally your statements were unreasonably implicit.Additionally, I would like to emphasize that the approach to fix the flaw is entirely out of the question and not subject to my review."

          "Contenu": "Well, where do i start. I spent hours researching televisions trying to find the one that fits my budget and my needs. i found tech for less on eBay and i thought they had great deals. I thought wrong! They sent the TV with some commercial delivery service that does not normally ship to residential addressing according to the woman at the freight company. After a week of trying to arrange a delivery, i finally got it. The TV came in with burnt out pixels and the picture on the screen jumping all over the place. Completely busted television. They're ad said it was new. I was so upset.\r I called then and i spoke with a girl named Anastasia in the customer service dept. who speaks with a very calming voice and is so nice which i admit calmed me down a lot. I agreed to purchase a different TV from them which cost almost another 200. (Another Bid Mistake, What was I thinking?)\r They shipped it fed ex this time so i was able to get delivery much easier. The package job was amateur at best and i never got the original box the TV came in. it looks used. It came in a brown generic box with two little pieces of Styrofoam holding it in place. I opened and set it up. And then i saw it. It was hard to see at first because the border of this Samsung TV is clear and transparent. So as i was peeling the plastic on the stand i noticed a crack in the corner of the border. Another botched delivery. It looks like it was dropped on its side because when you turn the screen on it looks like something is pressing on it the way a touch screen on your phone looks when you press it. \r Right now i am sitting here on a Saturday (my day off) waiting for fed ex to come back and pick it up which is what Anastasia told me to do. They gave me a window on when they are coming. Only problem is i just called Fed ex and they haven nothing scheduled at this address at all for the week. The only thing left to do is to call my bank and notify them of this issue and warn all my friends out there. \r DO NOT BUY FROM TECH FOR LESS!!"

I called customer service but they were already closed which was fine. I was able to get it to boot up after holding down the power button for a few cycles. I was a happy camper until I shut my computer down, when I turned it back on the same screen appeared. I tried doing the same thing as before but it would not boot up. I called on Monday after not being able to use my computer all weekend. Tech gave me the instructions that I had already preformed and nothing. They said that they can refund my money but that doesn't help me, I ordered this computer for a new job that I was starting and now I'm stuck. Between FedEx screwing up my delivery and getting me my computer 5 days late (no fault of Tech for less) and then this problem I used the computer for less than 12 hours. Kind of disappointed."

In effect, I had to pay $10 for an order that was never fulfilled.  I have asked Tech for Less to provide me a check or an Amazon gift card for the $10 and am hoping that they do the right thing. UPDATE as of 2/25/19:  I was advised by Tech For Less that Amazon Pay was the reason that the order was cancelled.  I called and confirmed with Amazon Pay that this was indeed the case, but it was a very laborious process to get the credit for the lost value of my gift card."

This is as rare as a hate mongering politician working for anyone other than the rich and powerful (which includes most of all themselves).Tech for Less has some really excellent pricing and it is a great place to shop which always features free shipping and delivery.

The checkout process was easy and smooth, but a strange thing happened after I got the order number and confirmation screen.  I switched to my email and saw I received an email exactly as expected yet when I swapped back to my conformation webpage it had changed to inform me what I ordered was out of stick.  However, the item out of stock was not what I ordered and was the wrong item number.  I contacted their email support found in the email and was answered Monday (I ordered on Saturday) and was passed to sales to investigate.  Within an hour it was confirmed my order was for what I thought and the \"out of stock\" was not my item.  After a couple more emails back and forth confirming they can ship my item as it was what I ordered.  They also offered to cancel the order if it was not right.Yeah, long story to say kudos for excellent customer support, follow-up, and I received the item just fine.  This is what customer support should be and what a customer should experience ordering from an online company."

To me in 3 or 4 days. The ordering was so simple and easy. That's the way it should be instead of having to create an online account. As soon as I hung up I had all the order confirmation on the phone. Also the guy who helped me was very efficient and nice. It couldn't have been easier. So glad I came across them!!!"
