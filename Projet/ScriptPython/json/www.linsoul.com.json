Really bad customer service,  will never buy from them again"

          "Contenu": "I bought a Simgot Fermat on November 16, the box arrived yesterday and there was a Moondrop Moonriver 2Ti instead of what I paid for.Of course, knowing all the hoops that Linsoul puts in place to avoid doing right by the customer, I made the unboxing video they ask for in their policy, sent them all the proof required and got an email saying that I had five days to return the product at my own expense with no real assurances that I would be reimbursed besides \"trust me bro\" and then wait an unspecified amount of time for their quality control to inspect the product (which is still factory sealed, mind you).Again with no time estimates about it, basically a BS way to wait out the customer protection time window of my payment method.So far, part for the course for Linsoul according to their policy but my jaw truly dropped when the email also stated:\"8) Please also help to declare the value at $30 to help to process the customs clearance.\"Which is a crime in every jurisdiction I know.Of course I escalated the issue to PayPal and if that doesn't pan out, I'll simply call my bank and say I was scammed, which is precisely what happened, I'm also letting Chinese authorities know about their charming little tax evasion practices.I've had issues with online businesses before but asking me to defraud customs is a solid first.Funny because they change their tune completely when selling through Amazon but whatever.My problem is that Linsoul pays YouTubers to say that they are the most trustworthy and honest of the ChiFi bunch but when it comes the time where they have to be honest, they ask me to commit a crime on their behalf while doing everything in their power to delay my return process until I effectively lose customer protection from my payment method.Worse still, only after the fact I became aware of the terrible reviews and horror stories regarding Linsoul on HeadFi and Trustpilot.Do not do business with Linsoul, if you absolutely have to, do it through Amazon because they cannot hold your money for ransom there.Regarding their answer, yes, only after I escalated the issue to PayPal they proposed a DHL label but what their answer forgot to mention was that the label would be sent (or not) on the condition that I drop the complaint with PayPal first.I don't know why do they think I would trust them enough to do that but there they are.Get over yourself Linsoul, you will send me a return label and reimburse me alright but just because PayPal will force you to, otherwise I'd still be stuck in your shady RMA and without my money.Not today and certainly not with me."

I will here only talking about their own brand Thieaudio but what you can expect is a good sounding product with a very short lifetime period. They make cheaper products ok but the very bad quality plus the money you'll spend in shipping + repair and on top all the hassle it requires to get the job done is definitely not worth it. Better spare a bit more and get products that match your expectations because those guys won't. You can be lucky but if you search a bit online, you'll see that their products are unfortunately not reliable despite the fact that they might sound good."

I supported the Indiegogo campaign for these earphones and was excited to receive them. When I did, one of them was defective and would not charge or switch on at all. I returned them to the manufacturer in China at the cheapest possible shipping method ($17), but the manufacturer would only reimburse $5 of the shipping cost because that is what it cost them to dispatch from China in the first place. So I got poor quality goods and paid $12 for the privilege."

I opened the gift to test it, and had the issue, but since it had been 7 days since I received the item, I was forced to pay $160 which is 80% of the product just to ship it back and get a replacement. On a normal product, I would understand, but when a manufacturer admits there is an issue, you should accept a return at face value. They also have you state the value of the return item is under $30 when shipping which seems a little sketchy to me."

Part of the risk when sourcing on the cheap (keep this in mind). Twice from less than 10 purchase - (different) product fail rate is >10%.A recent order was supplied incorrectly, with a $25 TWS IEM sent, rather than the $190 dongle DAC I ordered and paid for (including duties). Rather than just crediting me immediately, I was told to place another order for the same cheap TWS IEM. They would ship me my DAC. (I got a $10 discount on an item I never ordered nor have any use for. [LINSOUL, the correct remedy would be to CREDIT YOUR CUSTOMER IMMEDIATELY for your mistake, not find a convoluted way of reducing your $15 loss.] Then they shipped me another cheap TWS IEM, no DAC! I paid for the International Express shipping. Now I have 2 pairs of a cheap product I never ordered - one I gifted to a friend, the other I sold at a loss. After waiting for more than 2months for a shipment of the DAC I originally ordered and paid for, they agreed to refund me one shipping cost and give me a voucher for the original amount I paid (less my duties and fees). The (faulty) voucher did not work, but this was eventually resolved by Linsoul. I am currently waiting my last shipment from Linsoul. There are other shopping options out there. I lost $$ over the past year, because I chose to buy from Linsoul."

          "Contenu": "Having bought and returned a Linsoul in ear monitor lead to Amazon as I was shipped one with the wrong connector type I decided to try the company directly via their own web site. There was far more choice available directly from them and I ended up changing my mind about the cable I wanted and upgrading to an $89 ( yes 89 USD which seemed a bit crazy to me) MMCX 2.5mm balanced cable. It arrived in the UK and I paired it with my Westone UM40 Pro buds and my Astell & Kern SP1000M. Wow !!! I cannot stress enough the difference the cable has made to my listening experience. I used to regularly listen at a 120-130 volume level (out of a 0-150 range) and have dropped that to 100-110 at most. The sound is amazingly clear and defined. They also clip in and connect perfectly which prior leads I've owned haven't and I've had no glitches. It is incredible. In terms of service the email comms are good and I have only dropped this review to 4 stars from what would have been a 5 star review as I feel the delivery, especially the dispatch phase, was a little slow."
