          "Contenu": "This product worked about half of the time on my HP laptop.  I contacted customer service and they were never able to figure out what the problem was so I removed it from my computer, removed my credit card information so it wouldn't auto renew, then waited until the product expired.  It has now expired and they have pop-ups every minute or two notifying me that the service has lapsed and that I need to renew. I contacted customer service and was told to login to their website and change the settings so I no longer get messages.  Well, that doesn't work because as soon as I login, it directs me to a Pay page so I can't get to the settings to change anything.  I've looked online for help, and the suggestions I've found are that I need to buy a different pop-up blocker to keep Total AV's pop-ups from appearing.  That's crazy!  I'm going to contact them again and see if they can get this to stop, as I am being harassed by them incessantly.  Terrible product, and terrible customer service help.Update - 7/24/23 I followed the link that was provided below in response to this review and it appears that this resolution has worked.  It's too bad that their customer service couldn't have told me this very quick resolution, but instead gave me incorrect information twice on how to unistall their pop-ups, tried to upsell me multiple times then told me it had been fixed when it hadn't, and wasted over an hour of my time."

Out of 30,00,000 it detected 5,00,000 malware samples and out of 10,00,000 it detected 1,00,000 0-day malware attacks. Script based attacks were also tested and totalav did not do well on that. Only a few were detected. Not very nice results. Very low malware protection compared to norton eset and bitdefender. But the web protection is very good. Let me show you all how eset performed in my tests. ESET:-  Out of 30,00,000 eset detected 29,00,000 malware samples and out of 10,00,000 eset detected 9,00,000 0-day malware attacks. Nothing performed as well as eset did. So, overall you would prefer eset rather than a waste antivirus like TotalAV.  Also do note that I am a security researcher."

I'm still contemplating the full purchase offer.  I suppose you'll know which way I went.  Rene"

Whenever I went on new websites I would always get a nonifacation whether the website was safe or not. This was really helpfull because I didn't want to be on dangerous websites and I didn't want a virus on my device. Not to long ago I went on a bunch of different websites because I wanted to watch a tv show. After I had been on those websites I continued to get nonifacations telling my that someone had hacked into my device from Russia. There was also an add that showed that it new where I lived what kind of electronic I had and something with a bunch of numbers. Thats why I got this app is so that I wouldn't have this stuff happen to me again. Sadly I got a nonification saying that my account would expire in 2-3 days if I didn't upgrade to premium. From the time that I have had this app it has been very helpful to me and made me feel more safe. This is why I gave Trustpilot/Total WebShield a five star rating."
