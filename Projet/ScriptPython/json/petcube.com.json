The item worked until an email was sent at the beginning of this year advising the products software had a glitch and the camera needed to be removed and reinstalled. Well that stopped the night vision on the camera working and nothing will have it fixed. While PetCube attempted to fix the problem their resolution of its out of warranty and therefore my problem was most unsatisfactory. So you outlay funds to purchase the item, pay for an annual subscription and in the end you have nothing. Clearly a disposable item. There are far superior products on the market. My advice is do not purchase this product. It is a disposable item with a limited lifespan."

          "Contenu": "This review is specifically for Petcube's emergency fund. I have not purchased any of their other products. I had purchased their emergency fund after pawp went downhill. $30/month for $3000 in the case of an emergency is not a bad deal, however this company sets their clientele up for failure. You must get approval from their vets prior to your visit to an emergency room in order for them to pay, which is pretty standard. However, they only allow you to text chat with the vet and send pictures/videos. There is no video chat feature. There is no phone chat option. You know, the options that would allow you to save time when facing an EMERGENCY. Oh, also, if your video clip is too large, their interface won't be able to send it to the vet. Their advice? Just take another video but make sure it's under 30 seconds. Or, while you're facing this potentially life-threatening crisis, just take the time to crop your video (assuming you know how), and then try re-sending to see if that works. Really stellar customer care here. And when I complained about this interface and it's backwards configuration in the face of an emergency? Whoops! Sorry, they can't reimburse me because I didn't get approval before heading to the emergency room. But they will \"take note on my suggestion regarding a video chat feature.\" Real quality care, right there."

There is an ad for \"Petcube Care Up to 90 day video history + pet and human alerts $3.99/month\" and when I click on it, the 90 day video history is clearly with the $9.99/month? I think I'm on the $5.99/month plan but I have no easy way to check if it booted me off of this when it disconnected me from the camera.Also, camera doesn't seem to catch most pet movement during the night, very disappointing. Can't wait for a better product to come out."

You have to just sit there and move your phone around until it reads it or keep restarting the whole process. Second- The subscription plans are very confusing. You have different options. BEWARE of the \u201cpromotion\u201d for the Pet Care bundle. You will have to pay $5.99 each month for a YEAR. If you wish to keep the camera. Another thing that is confusing is that if you have multiple cameras you either have to pay 5.99 for each camera subscription or the premium 14.99 each month for various cameras. Third- Costumer service is awful. Sure they respond quickly, but only to tell you to wait, and wait, and wait, and you get my point. They initially told me 24-48 hrs. We\u2019re going on almost 2 weeks and I still can\u2019t use my camera. As far as the cameras go, they are okay. If you try to use the speaker to talk to your pet it is an extremely loud, and static noise that only scares my pets. It\u2019s also blurry. All in all, just save your money and look for something different. I (( DO NOT )) recommend Petcube. Awful."

It was a massive waste of my time and energy and I regret having contacted them. I suppose now I at least know better that they have nothing of use to offer if/when another problem with my products ever arises.

I contacted customer service by email since you can not actually speak to anyone by phone.  Customer support has been beyond horrible.  I have gotten several email responses each time with a different solution to try and set up my device.  I was even offered a replacement unit since they believe the device might be defective.  Asked for my mailing  information which I send back immediately.  Till this day I have no new device, after several days I received another email asking me for pictures of what the camera does when I try to set it up. Customer support is by far the WORST I have ever encountered.  Beyond DISSAPOINTED with this company."

          "Contenu": "The company seems well organized and helpful, but the product was very disappointing. The features of the app and the product were limited in such a way that it altogether failed to meet my expectations and needs. Specifically, I was looking for something that would allow me to view my pet in real time whenever I accessed the platform. Instead, the petcube only provided snapshots of activity, which in my opinion, serves no purpose at all if not augmented by real time viewing. Perhaps I am missing something, but this feature was absent from what I could tell. I also did not feel comfortable with the privacy options on the app. It was very unclear if I was setting my options to the level of privacy I wanted. The app just wasn\u2019t very user friendly or clear."

So, because I couldn\u2019t reply to their email in a quick turn around my Petcube order was canceled without my concent. My money was refunded, but doesn\u2019t not help fix any of my disappointment. I notified customer service to see if there was anything that could be done about my order and their reply was just a statement about what back about what happened and I have not received any reply back to my follow email. I was very excited about this, but the experience over all has been a little unsettling.  I\u2019m not sure if i have enough trust in this company again to try and make another purchase while I am deployed if this could happen again or if I even want to at this point.

When I called customer service, it went straight to voicemail or a busy signal.  I finally got through the online customer service via chat and was told that the item was never in stock to begin with at the time I purchased it.  I should not have been able to purchase it if it were not available.  Also, I was never notified of any potential delays to the order throughout the time I waited for delivery.  I'm also very convinced that it would not have been shipped if I never reached customer service.   Meanwhile, the price has dropped significantly (50% down) since my purchase, and yet I still had not received the item.  So in the end, I paid a premium for a product that did not arrive on time, and I was very surprised to learn how the operations was handled."

The live stream quality was really bad, like watching something with dial up internet, nothing but slow motion pixels moving across my screen which constantly had blurry colours interferring. Our internet connection is fantastic and we have never had an issue in the past, as we stream netflix daily. The 4 and 5 second clips were recorded with great quality but it would record EVERYTHING even when there was absolutely no sound or movement. Do you know how annoying it is having to individually delete 4 second clips that are recorded ALL DAY? I decided to upgrade to the optimal package which cost me $48USD as it promised to give me 30 second clips. Well well, much to my surprise it is STILL recording 4 and 5 second clips, no 30 second clips in sight. And to top it off, today, I haven't been able to log in all day as it keeps saying 'timeout' or 'data synchronization fail'.I am angry I wasted $200AUD to buy this stupid device, and then a further $48USD to 'upgrade' to what appears to be the worst product I've ever bought. Do yourself a favour and buy a baby monitor and stay well away from this crap product."

If it does indeed take 5 to 10 days to process refunds, why was I not told that? Whatever,  now I can block all the emails from Petcube. ******I bought a Petcube Play to make sure my puppy is OK when I'm away from home.  But even when sitting in the room with the camera, the picture quality was poor and much too laggy to  really see what's going on. Attempting to view using a nearby cafe's Wi-Fi was impossible - the app disconnected after less than a minute and then refused to connect again. From reading other reviews, it seems this is an issue with Android phones,  so why is it marketed as being suitable for Android users? It certainly is not! But there's more...  I contacted Petcube on March 9 through its live chat to request a refund. Following the advisor's instructions,  I posted the device back to Petcube the same day.  As I used Royal Mail Track & Trace, I  know it was received by Petcube in the Netherlands on March 13. Yet all I received from the company were nonsensical emails, almost daily,  saying they hadn't heard from me and were going to 'solve the ticket'. Even replying to said emails didn't stop them coming. On March 21, I tried live chat again, was told my case would be passed to a senior supervisor. Nothing. On March 23, I used a feedback form - they really love those!!!  - to complain and on the 26th was contacted by a 'Senior Customer Support Engineer',  who asked for the tracking number.  I supplied it the same day and was then told I would receive my refund by the end of the week.     NEW: As of 3pm today there was no sign of a refund but it miraculously appeared almost immediately after I posted this review. And don't get me started on the constant emails trying to get me to sign up to their subscription package..."

          "Contenu": "Prior to purchase, mid-November, I reached out to customer support via e-mail as well as a couple of phone numbers found online to ask some questions.  I received an auto reply to my e-mail stating they would try to answer my inquiry within 24 hours, and both phone numbers were disconnected.  Never received an e-mail response and it's now mid January. I sent 2 other e-mails after November, to no avail.   I did end up purchasing the unit on Amazon, just to see if it was a good option, knowing it could be returned.  My concern is if/when an issue arises, there is literally no support available.  I am curious as to some of these reviews implying they were able to reach a customer service rep...even if they weren't happy with the rep, because I got a recording that the numbers were disconnected.  The irony one day is I tried the first number online that popped up under their customer service number, and it was one of their competitors (!!) so I decided to give their product a try, too.  The customer support for Petchatz is over and above, though the unit is much different than the petcube Playcube 2...much larger, more expensive, but has some very, very cool features:  Two way audio AND video, a treat dispenser that can be activated via their app, and though not good for a cat, but if you have a dog, there is an optional 'pet call' button a dog can be trained to press and call you~!  How cool is that.  So at the moment, though petcube is functioning fine on day 4, I have no way of contacting the company for support. Ever.  The Petchatz rep spent over a half hour on the phone with me the first time I called (trying to reach Petcube Play 2 support) and since then I have contacted them 3 times with other questions, etc. and always reached a person or a voicemail which was returned within minutes.  I was even given the rep's cell phone the day I set it up to contact her anytime that night if the unit went offline...who does that?  So do your research, I am going to leave it up to my daughter, but extremely disappointed in the PetCubePlay2 customer service which is literally non-existent, and overly impressed with Petchatz at how they truly show they value each and every customer."

The camera worked great for about 2.5/3 months, and then lost connection with my WIFI and would not reconnect no matter what i tried. I contacted Tech support and they determined the WIFI module was bad, and the tech offered to replace it. A few hours later i received an email stating they needed a receipt, i replied back letting them know it was a gift and I did not have a receipt, just as I had advised the tech this during the troubleshooting process. So now i have a camera that is only good as a paper weight, because they will not replace the camera under warranty like the tech said they would. This is why i rated it 2 STARS  UPDATE: A week after posting this review i was contacted by customer support (management, I believe) an was offered a replacement camera. Today I received my camera.It is a real shame i could not get support until i was forced to place a negative review just to get support.I want to change the star rating but for the fact the extent i had to go through to get this resolved i will move it up to 3 Stars. As my Title say Good Camera, Horrible support."

It worked great at first, then a later update caused the laser to respond very infrequently. The video quality also was not great, which was a major decision in purchasing the new one. The video quality of my new Petcube Play is great. However, the laser feature almost never goes off. I know that it responds to a lot motion, however, I have been dancing in front of the camera, close and far away, and it just doesn\u2019t go off. If I wanted a regular webcam, I could\u2019ve bought one, cheaper. I really wish there was an option to turn on the laser automatically at intervals of every half hour or fifteen minutes. Right now, there is no rhyme or reason to the auto laser, and I feel like this is more software related because it happened to both my old Petcube and my new Petcube Play.I would love to update the firmware to potentially increase the quality of the device, however, in order to do so, you need to call the company to initiate a firmware update. Just why?Another frustration I\u2019ve had is that there are advertisements within the app. Full screen ads that you have to close, which show up intermittently. If I paid for the hardware, I shouldn\u2019t be getting ads in the app. I have it set in iTunes and App Store to disable in app purchase notifications, but they still appear regardless."

It was late on a Friday so I didnt expect to hear back before Monday. Stuff gets forgotten in packaging, it happens.  I signed up for the Petcare and was getting push notifications non stop. Check the account and notice it is constantly uploading videos even when no one (including the dog) were home. Watch one of the +60 video recorded past midnight and notice some sort of electrical interference the mic was picking up. So I fire off another email and turn off noise recording and push notifications (negating the entire reason I signed up for the $30 petcare). Sent the second email Saturday, day after first email, and again expect to hear something by Monday. Fast forward a week and still havent hear back from my emails. Ok, I'll call them. Sat on hold for 5 minutes and got the option for them to call back once someone is available. I opt for that. Now, 10 days later, still no call back. Still no return email. Still no items that were supposed to be in the box. Still no resolution on electrical noise. If customer service sucked but it worked as advertised, I'm good. If it didnt work but customer service was trying to fix it, I'm good. But right now, it can do part of what is advertised and I get ghosted by CS. Unfortunately I bought this as a gift or I would have returned it by now."

Then before a long overseas vacation in August I bought another and set up a second camera, thinking that the petcube care package I had already subscribed with would cover both.  Wrong! I had to pay a subscription for each camera.  Kind of frustrating but too late to return it days before the trip, so I signed up for a month with the intention of downgrading later.  When got home, I unplugged one of the cameras and cancelled the subscription on that camera.  In December, I noticed that I was still getting charged for both subscriptions even though the subscription page in my app said I would be charged 0.00/month on the second camera.I have written several emails to the address on the Petcube website, with zero response.I tried setting up the second camera again, thinking that if I was paying for it I might as well use it, but in the intervening time we'd upgraded our internet and both cameras were no longer connecting. I kept getting errors when trying to enter new network details.  I contacted customer support for help with this issue but didn't receive a response until after I had left on my Christmas vacation a couple of days later.When I returned yesterday, I decided to cancel the subscription and simply unplug both cameras.  Today though, I was charged for a subscription (only one though, luckily!) and when I logged in to the app I was still somehow subscribed even though I got an acknowledgement email when I cancelled the day before.  I have now cancelled AGAIN.  We'll see if it sticks this time.This company is dodgy as hell and their customer support is terrible. Two stars because when the product works it's actually ok. My worst complaint is the push notifications that the camera had 'detected a human' when there should not be anyone around, and that I can't set up the app and connect on my husband's camera.  I wish I could get a refund but I won't hold my breath.  If you are considering going to a pet cam, please consider a different company unless you have some money you don't mind throwing away."

          "Contenu": "I have a petcube bites, which I've had for about 3.5 years now. The actual camera captures a wide field of view, works extremely well in the dark, and the motion detection is quite responsive.The treat dispensing is poor, as sometimes the treat gets stuck, it makes a noise that can scare a dog, and the precision of the dispenser leaves a lot to be desired. Anyone crating their dog might get 1/3 of the treats into the cage.The biggest drawback to the product is the software. I have set this up in four different locations, and not once has the process been simple. It often involves multiple device resets and deleting the camera from my profile and re-adding. I have contacted petcube's tech support for help connecting on two of these occasions, including the most recent set-up. During this recent set-up, tech support had to delete the camera on their end before I could connect, even though I had removed the camera on my end. In addition, when I view my dog with the camera and disconnect, the camera in the app almost always shows as offline, and I have to go into camera settings to trigger it to show online again--not a dealbreaker but annoying. I found I would often lose connection after watching for a minute or so, and then wanting to go back and reconnect to watch again would require the short, but inconvenient workaround. Finally, the updates seem to come on suddenly with no warning and even on a strong internet connection can take a very long time to apply, all the while you cannot use the camera. If you are away, you only find out the camera is updating when you go to check on your pet and the camera is unavailable.All in all, I would recommend the camera, but would advise to check and see if they've improved the treat dispenser in the new iteration, if treat dispensing is a strong consideration for you. If treat dispensing is not important, I'd probably recommend a different version than the bites, assuming the camera functionality is the same across the models. The software experience has been bad for me, but tech support is good and responsive, so if you budget for a frustrating hour setting up the device, for the most part, you'll be smooth sailing afterwards."

I had been using a Canary camera with a treat and train on my dog until I saw Petcube and Furbo advertisements. I really wanted the ability to dispense treats remotely and the Treat and Train only gives you the option to dispense treats at set time periods. I got the camera really fast and signed up for the subscription. PROS:1. Camera picture is really clear and has night mode. Less blurry than my Canary and more responsive. Almost too responsive.2. Shipping was really fast3. The camera is super easy to set up and connect to Wifi. 4. Easy to move the camera around the house or to alternate locations2. The subscription deal is a great way to try out the camera at a budget price. CONS:1. The camera lens is on the bottom of the unit so unless it's placed on the edge of the the table, you see a lot of table in the shot. You can't flip it over or put it on it's side due to the treat dispenser. 2. The treat dispenser doesn't dispense consistently. I would say it get stuck and fails about 25% of the time. I bought the treats that were recommended for the device by Petcube and it still isn't consistent.3. If you crate your dog, the treat dispenser will be fairly useless. I tried positioning it in many different ways around the crate but the dispensing isn't consistent and often the treat would miss the crate or fly past it.  I fixed this issue by putting a tube over the dispensing hole with molding puddy and it worked great to direct the treat into the crate. The camera has to be right up on the crate though but I can usually see most of the crate. 4. The app is a little confusing and some things don't work. For instance, you are supposed to have an ability to time some dispensing but it doesn't seem to be happening. I also tried to invite users (my partner and some dog sitters) from the app and they never got the invite. So I had to just email them separately and ask them to download the app.5. The Wifi connection isn't awesome. It's in the same room as my router and I have fiber so the speed shouldn't be the issue and all my other Wifi devices work fine. I find it goes offline easily- though i can usually get it to connect at some point. I will admit, I had this same issue with my Canary camera so not sure if that technology is still not great or if cameras are just incompatible with my router..."

I'm supposed to get notifications when my pet moves and I'd say that works probably 50% of the time. It bothers me that I can't shut off the laser completely. When I log in to the app, I can shut it off, but if I go out and come back in the laser will default to being on again. When I set the camera to \"sleep\" when I get home, it will still record motion (aka me walking around my apartment). This totally weirds me out so I've started to just unplug it when I'm home. Fortunately, it's quick to get back online upon plugging it back in. With all that being said, the video is clear and I'm able to easily save any clips that I want to keep. I just feel that for what I paid, it should work more consistently."

You should have an alert when someone is actively trying to view your camera to allow or deny their access. The laser should sleep when inactive for over 30 seconds. The lights on the cube should also inactivate when not in use to not blind the cat. The laser should motion sensor the cats face so when it goes at random it doesn't go in the cats eyes. The turn on noise that clicks should be something more fun like a meow or woof instead of a chime. My cat responds to it. The two-way talk feature sounds robotic. Can't wait for them to enhance and update the cube then I'll come back and buy!"

If it weren't for them (Marina and Chad), I would have rated \"Bad\". My camera stopped working and customer service is only available by email which takes at least 36 hours to get a response. When Chad responded to my first email, I replied immediately and of course no response back, yet and it's been almost 24 hours again. I begged for someone to call me while I'm at home to troubleshoot but of course no call or response. If they do respond today via email, it will be a waste of time bcus I don't carry my camera to work! The audio also sucks too, the static sound scares my pets.  The camera I purchased on amazon for $35 is much, much better."

It has a long cord, but finding the perfect position near an outlet that also fits on a shelf is a challenge. In a bigger apartment this probably wouldn't be an issue. Manual suggests placing at least 3 feet above floor, but to be honest, that seems too high. Half the time my cats are off camera because they are low to the floor. \u2022 Start up manual doesn't include info on how to load the treats. The lid to the dispenser is hard to remove, so I started to doubt that was where you load them. Thankfully, you only have to remove the lid once in a while as treats need replacing. \u2022 Not ideal when treats are small. The dispenser shoots out 6 or 7 at a time. They kind of get sprayed out across the floor. My kitten loves chasing treats, so he seemed to like it. Initially, he was skittish because the dispenser is kind of loud. My older cat can't be bothered. I think it confuses her. Uneaten treats have been stepped on and make a mess.\u2022 Having to have wifi on all the is another issue. My apple Wifi gets hot so I don't leave it on when I'm away which defeats the purpose of having the Pet Camera. I didn't do enough research before I bought it as to how it works. My bad."

I had some issues with keeping the camera connected, but it was a simple fix. If you have a converter router that has 2.4 and 5g and the network names are the same, you just have to change one of them. The FAQ answer made it seem more complicated than that but once i figured that out I had no issues. The picture quality is good for a $40 camera. It is serving its purpose as a quick solution for my needs. Customer service was very responsive and willing to help. They checked in several times to make sure my issue was resolved. I recommend it for a simple monitoring device. I would just be mindful if you are using to monitor a puppy or dog that is a chewer or interested in wires. I am still trying to find the best placement for my camera, going to try to mount it."

The camera quality is pretty good and the zoom function works to allow you to really see your pet. The laser can be very slow to respond and doesn't always go where you tell it to. The motion activation recording can be activated by changes in light inside the house, not just your pet, but overall that just means you have more recordings. I would buy this product again!"

The only downfall is that once you unplug the camera you loose the free 4 hours of video stored. Sometimes we wanted to review the video after we discovered something missing and couldn't if it was already unplugged. Other than that, it as been great!"

As soon as he hears the noise the camera makes when it drops treats to be launched, he comes running. One issue I've had is that because his kitten treats are so small, the Petcube typically shoots out 7 or 8 treats at once, while I would prefer less at a time so I would feel better about giving them to him several times throughout the day. I doubt this would happen with dog treats since they tend to be a little bigger. I also have had some minor connectivity issues, but this may be primarily related to my WiFi connection rather than the Petcube itself. Overall, I really like it and have enjoyed playing with my cat while I'm away from home. I would definitely recommend it to friends with pets, especially dog owners."

Also, the voice feature works well, you can hear the dog and they can hear you like you are in the room with them, but we won\u2019t ever use it (unless it is necessary) because we think it might make him edgy to hear us and not see us.The only thing I don\u2019t like, is that there is no Off and On button, at least I have not found it. Also, that it doesn\u2019t come with a stand to place on the floor or to the edge of a table was a negative for us. Other than that, it is very user friendly and we have already recommended it to other pet parents (you can also use it as a normal \u201cspy\u201d camera, not only for pets *wink wink* lol)."

The treat dispenser has been reliable up until this last week- it hasn't been dispensing and I haven't quite been able to figure out the problem.  My biggest concern with the camera is that it frequently tells me \"busy\" and that I need to wait 90 seconds when no one is using the camera except me.  I've tried a few different things (waiting for it to load, quitting the program, etc.) but this problem still seems to randomly persist at least 3 times per day.  I would still recommend Petcube Bites to anyone looking to monitor their pet but you may experience some technical difficulties along the way."

          "Contenu": "I ordered my Petcube a few weeks ago, and so far, am truly pleased with my purchase. The cube itself is small, compact and easy to place on a lower level shelf or the floor. I put mine on the bottom tier of a bookshelf and have a great view of the entire living room. The Petcube has a long power cord which is super helpful for those who have older apartments where outlets can be a bit scarce. In addition, the device was relatively easy to set up and log into, so I was up and running in no time.Since hooking up the Petcube, I have taken time throughout my day to check in on my cats. It is fairly entertaining to see what they are up to, but in addition, it is nice to know that they are safe and nothing bad has gone down while I am at work.My only point of concern with the purchase is that there is no ability to turn the Petcube on or off. Ideally, the app would have a \"at home\" feature which would turn off the video feed but that is not the case. So, if you are worried about personal privacy, the only way to turn off the cube is to physically unplug the device. Other than that hassle, the Petcube has been a great addition to my kitty care routine!"

          "Contenu": "We have a very naughty, clever Bengal who loves nothing more than treats and I've always wanted to know what he gets up to when we aren't here (other than terrorising his brother, that's obvious because of the clumps of fur around the house)This device comes in a really cool box, super easy instructions and set up. I would 100% recommend this product only if you can attach it to a wall (screws and a easy measuring guide provided) because after the first treats came flying out our cat tried to eat the pet cube, attack the pet cube and then sat there and tried to get his paw up in the hole to knock out treats so needless to say it was on its back in 30 seconds post treat giving.The camera on it is great fun, good quality, a really wide angle and starts recording when it senses the cats. The app and pet cube paired easily, the flashing lights indicate different things so is easy to know when it's recording. You can only pair one device but share with family and they can then view the camera too and feed treats if they fancy. I personally liked this but might be worth briefing them not to over feed! Some reviews have mentioned you can\u2019t turn it off but if you don\u2019t want anyone to view it just in plug it or don\u2019t allow them access to the camera!My cat is so intrigued by it. He goes nuts when he hears our voice through the speaker, its loud enough that he can hear it from other rooms. He will sit and stare at it for hours hoping more treats will fly out (the distance you can get on the treats is hilarious!) The price seems a little expensive but for piece of mind that your pets are ok and the fact it can basically double as a security camera as it has night mode, makes it worth the money!"

At first i thought it was a tech issue because i knew i had paid, but they very quickly saw that my petcube on my app was in sleep mode. I really appreciated that they were able to figure out the problem so quickly! They were also able to help me figure out billing and managing of both my petcubes, and cleared up a lot of confusion for me. I really appreciated the quick answers, and everything was very clear and easy for me to understand. Thank you so much Alnie! :)"
