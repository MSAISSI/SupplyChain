Want to purchase then install I realize the extension was not necessary and called to return it just to find out the policy was not to take back extensions.

The checkout reflected the reduction and showed a total price of $1,008 plus taxes to be determined.I then went through the checkout procedure, thin king my order was satisfactory.  When the order summary was posted, there were two crown molding kits and a cost 0f $1118.I immediately e-mailed the company noting that I o only wanted one crown molding kit.  To no avail.  I received two.Just to rub my nose it this extra $90 plus tax, the next day the hood I ordered was reduced in. price substantially.  That's the way it goes - I needed to order the hood ASAP and couldn't wait for sales.  I didn't need, and don't want two crown moldings.  The in ability of RH to correct this fiasco is frustrating."

          "Titre": "Damage with no recourse",
          "Contenu": "I will say that the exhaust hood that we ordered is a quality product, but I certainly would not purchase from this particular company again. We are builders in New Jersey, as a matter of course to stay ahead of things and on schedule, we order items well in advance of when they are needed. When this exhaust vent hood was delivered, it was noted that there was slight damage to the box, at which point I wrote on the delivery receipt that it was damaged and called the company as well to report the damage. Unbeknownst to us, they have a 60 day period to inspect the item for physical damage. As mentioned, we order items in advance, so they are on hand when needed, inspection of the actual item took place at the job site a few days past the 60 day review window, and damage was only noticed after we peeled off the protective film. At that point, we were informed of the 60 day review window, with no recourse. We of course thought this seemed unfair, so my manager has called this company no less than three times, requesting a callback from a manager. You would think they would respectfully at least call back, but they have not as of this writing.So our advice is just beware, and inspect your items immediately once they come in, no matter the condition of the box, as the condition of our box in no way represented the damage that was done to the unit. We tried to do the right thing and be proactive, if someone at their company told us we only had 60 days to unpack the product and inspected, we would have done so.T. Smith/J.

Also, the installation instructions were very difficult to follow and I am very handy. Lastly, the trim kit only works on a very limited opening, I had to modify the kit to fit in the space for the microwave. A trim kit should allow for various opening sizes, this one does not."

Out of my many years of dealing with sales managers, owner, sales people, etc. I can honestly say she was the worse.  Zline definitely should get rid of her immediately.  After insisting on speaking with a higher up manager in the company, I was finally transferred to Robyn. Robyn was very nice and took care of the problem immediately."
