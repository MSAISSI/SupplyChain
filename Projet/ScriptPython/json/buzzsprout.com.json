You cans set-up your web page using BUzzsprout, but yo can't access any visit information to learn about if you're really discovered or are the transcriptions/descriptions of the episode getting any traffic. Stats for the episodes are also poor. It's convenient for the team to say that they collect stats based on some bare-minimum standard. In fact, we have to conduct additional analysis ourselves using spreadsheets to measure the podcast performance.An more than that, if you're going multi-channel, Buzzsprout stats are even more useless. 25% of our listens come from Buzzsprout, the rest is done on other platforms such as YouTube or Facebook Watch. If you really are into monitoring performance of the podcast and going wide with it, Buzzsprout isn't the best tool for that.The only reason why we are staying is that we don't think we want to put effort in moving elsewhere."

Days later, my account is still suspended and they\u2019re telling me I made no payment.  I\u2019ve had to get bank app screenshots to prove I did in fact pay.  It took half a dozen back and forth emails because they kept denying receipt of my account payments. They are still denying my latest payment despite having proof from my bank it was paid.   I\u2019m going to have to report them to my bank for services not received.   They seem to have a lot of staff as it\u2019s always a different name on the emails sent to me but, not one has the ability to view my transactions for the last two months.   I\u2019m not good with stress and needing to exert excess energy because a company is unprofessional or inept. Il have to find a more accurate and suitable podcast host for my needs.  I should have read these reviews first.  I never trust a company with loads of reviews left by people who have only ever left one review.   It looks suspicious, usually with good reason.  I\u2019m guessing these reviewers and the company employees have similar names."

I think you could come up with a better model for this if you gave it some thought. I have two podcasts and one is episodic. I publish 5 or 6 episodes once a year. Your plans are expensive for that sort of podcast. Generally your pricing seems suited to a weekly podcast, but not all podcasts are like that. It is of course up to you how you price your plans, but I think that you are missing a large part of the market."

This is critical because that's what makes YouTube so successful with podcasts. It also doesn't offer the ability to sell digital products. If I were to start a podcast today, I would just go straight to either Substack or YouTube because that's where discovery is happening now in 2023. If your podcast is about a topic that YouTube censors, then Substack's new podcast functionality (with video) would still be better than Buzzsprout or YouTube. In 2024, I plan to move all of my podcasts off Buzzsprout and host them on Substack or YouTube. If you want a simple audio-only podcast, even then I would say that other, more modern platforms are potentially better."

Firstly, we could not upload a transcript - this is a PAID FOR feature which is not obvious according to the help documentation. When we did upload the transcript it shows as just one long mass of text - Buzzsprout uses a non-standard format for transcript files which we will have to spend time deciphering. Next, we wanted to push our podcasts to the various directories but the help documentation and videos did not match the actual experience - yes, things change, but the help documentation had not kept up. Then we couldn't push to Google Podcasts because this was now a PAID FOR feature - again, not how it is shown on the sales/help sections of the website. That's OK, we were going to pay for a subscription anyway, but to be forced to do it straight away because 2 important features were not available (as advertised) was a bit naughty. Finally, pushing the podcast to a couple of directories/or claiming them on the relevant Podcast site requires your email address to be in your RSS feed - this is not how it is shown in the sales/help sections of Buzzsprout - in fact, it requires finding a special page where you can add the email address for 24 hours to get this sorted. Not obvious, and time consuming. All in all though. I can recommend Buzzsprout as a Podcast management platform. If it wasn't for these niggles/problems outlined here (which I did ultimately solve) I would have given them 5 out of 5."

Just decide what your goals are before diving in."

That's a lot more than my pay grade can afford. If you need to expand to a more reasonable 10 hours, that will cost you even more. That's crazy.If you're going to do any kind of serious podcasting, you'll need at least six hours a month. I switched to a host which actually has many more features, a webpage (except it doesn't have magic mastering) and unlimited upload time, all that for 15 bucks a month, you do the math, it's a no-brainer."

However I think their price point for entry-level paid subscription ($12/month) is high compared to the services and 3 hrs/month. Also, I like to finalize my audio mix the way I want and I know how to do it, so I'm not impressed by things like magic-mastering (which by the way is not included in the price)... but I was surprised to understand that their system re-convert your mp3 files by lowering the quality/bitrate and that's a huge minus for me. I currently host on a competitor with cheaper price for much more hours (no monthly limit), no unwanted editing on my original file and unlimited podcasts on the same account. That's why I suggest they reconsider their price point for the entry level subscription, because their site is so good as well as their customer service."

Watched a Buzzsprout video and the instructions were not detailed enough. I do like Buzzsprout because it got me out to people in my podcast quickly. I like the drag and drop they offer for other sites. The other thing I wonder is can you export to multiple venues (FB & YouTube) at the same time? I have a channel on youtube and would like it to go there, also. I think Buzzsprout is reasonably priced, also."

When I have needed assistance it was usually due to program ignorance on my part, but in those conversations I was assisted without hesitation. The platform is easy to use and makes some good recommendations in terms of logo design software (Canva). I have made more than 300 in less that 8-months so that software is definitely a great recommendation. I can't say enough about how quick the service is when requested. And as one might suspect the long I use Buzzsprout the less mistakes I make which leaves me more time to add to my Podcast audio library. You guys have been great. Thanks and I look forward to many more messages and followers!"
