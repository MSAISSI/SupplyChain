Not in my case one year ago I might add but there you go. Loyalty isn't rewarded with this business and given how clunky, often offline and unreliable this QR code offering is, loyalty really should be rewarded."

If you're looking for just a simple use case of QR code technology, I would reccomend something less intensive."

Another option would be to enable entering different phone numbers than the options offered. In short, a bit more flexibility for creating the vCard would be five stars."

The scannability of their QR codes is impressive, and I have never had any issues with them not scanning properly. While I do wish there were more templates for vCards and HTML5, and telephone support would be great, their email support is responsive. I would highly recommend QR TIGER to anyone looking for a reliable and efficient QR code generator."

As it turns out, the issue was ultimately on my end with my WiFi -- after isolating the issue and the QR codes worked fine on my mobile using cellular data. I am glad this all worked out and the printed collateral is not a total fail. Leaving my rating at 4-stars because of the amount of time/frustration and the multiple attempts required to get here. I suggest the QR-Tiger team please update their customer help FAQ and trouble-shooting scripts.~~original review ~~I want to love my purchase, but it\u2019s been a disappointmentI want to love my purchase, because I spent a lot of time researching options. I chose QR Tiger because it had great features including good geolocation and de-duping of unique users. I am also the one making these recommendations, so I am also personally on the hook.However, I\u2019ve had repeated QR code failures for no apparent reason. Customer Support was responsive within 24-hours \u2014 sent me screenshots to show it was working on their end, with a list of troubleshooting tips \u2014 but now no further response. QR code worked one day, then QR code didn\u2019t work a few hours later. I checked on iPhone and Android mobile phones. And Mac desktop on two different browsers.Unfortunately, I\u2019ve just sent a batch to print on card stock and may have thrown away a few hundred dollars there. We are a new business/brand and just launched on Saturday. So this was both an important issue and expensive in terms of money and opportunity missed (customer scans). Will give this another week or so but probably will switch to Beaconstac if things don\u2019t get resolved."
