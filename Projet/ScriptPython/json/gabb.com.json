Can't get customer service to resolve the issues (I've spent literally hours on hold or waiting on chat for interaction). Emails and messages telling me to reset or update that doesn't fix any issues.Basically wasting time and money for a device that doesn't work and can't get timely or useful responses from the company. I can't even cancel my service since I can't speak with anyone! Extremely disappointed, I wouldn't recommend getting anything from Gabb unless it's been out for at least a year so they can resolve their technical issues."

          "Contenu": "I left a review several weeks ago that was removed - not sure why. This company is the worst. We were sent a phone that didn't work weeks ago. Spent hours on the phone trying to \"troubleshoot\" the problem with this paperweight. When I posted a review here, Maggie called me and offered to send an upgraded phone at no charge and give me 3 months service. I guess that's their SOP to keep consumers on the hook. Maggie offered to make an appointment with us for set up. I replied twice to do that, no response. That should have been another warning. So now it's time to set up the phone (it's for my son who just got back). It does not work. Hours on the phone and it still does not work. Not having a working phone has been beyond inconvenient. The hours and hours spent on the phone with Gabb have been costly and frustrating. I recommend you avoid this company at all costs. There are others out there."

          "Contenu": "**Gabb Wireless has an F rating and pages and pages of unanswered complaints with the Better Business Bureau! Buyer BEWARE!** This company is very dishonest and their products are subpar. I have been a customer for several years. There are constant issues with pairing to the parent's Gabb app for accurate location information, the quiet settings during school don't work and my child keeps getting in trouble for his phone making noises when it's supposed to be silent. To make matters worse, I've had multiple technical issues with 2 different devices. They are not made to last, they are made to break so the company can collect ridiculous deductibles and monthly fees. Most recently, my son's phone wouldn't let him open his phone with his fingerprint or the correct password. Customer service is horrible. They don't post the number on the website to make it harder to get support - once you do get the number from the chat feature, be ready to be on hold for at least 45 minutes and then get hung up on. I finally got through after multiple attempts and the customer service rep told me we would have to do a factory reset. After going through that whole process, it caused the phone to start shutting down over and over. So I called with 1 issue and ended up with a worse problem! When I call back because the phone keeps shutting down, I'm told it'll have to be replaced and despite paying monthly for the extended warranty, I'll have to pay a deductible that is nearly the cost of the current price of the phone!! Mind you, I'm only having to replace it due to the new issue caused by the directions I was following from their customer service rep!! Outrageous! I tell them this is unacceptable and they said I could try talking to the billing department to see if they would adjust the fee. I wait on hold yet again. After finally talking to billing, they will not budge. I tell them that I shouldn't have to pay for a replacement on a phone that looks perfect - no visible damage at all - but is a terrible product that their tech dept made worse with their \"troubleshooting\" directions. I decided to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. In filing that complaint, I see that Gabb is not accredited by the BBB and it has PAGES AND PAGES of unanswered complaints with an F rating from BBB! Buyer Beware!!!"

Also, we went on a vacation and we paid for my son to be able to send and receive photos.  When his phone died, he lost all his vacation pictures because apparently, we didn't pay another storage fee.  This company charges for everything but is not good at helping the customer understand the services.  We are locked into a 2-year contract, but I wish we could change that.  I thought this would be a good alternative to something that gets on the internet but I was wrong."

My daughter\u2019s device will show that she has data service (when she doesn\u2019t but she has no idea), so she doesn\u2019t know she\u2019s not receiving our texts until she gets home from school and we ask her why she never responded. We restart the phone and magically all her texts from throughout the day will then arrive. But in the meantime we can\u2019t get ahold of her! Their customer service has been beyond frustrating having us update apps, reset the device, they did a \u201cnetwork reset,\u201d they sent us a new SIM card, they had us do a factory reset\u2026 and in between all of these steps we wait to see if it fixed the problem. Nope, not yet! And this has been going on for 6+ months. The software is buggy, too. Now that we\u2019ve done their latest \u201cfix\u201d of the factory reset we can\u2019t restore my daughter\u2019s gabb cloud data back to her phone - even though when speaking with customer service today they were able to see her gabb cloud backup from this afternoon. Their solution was a software update that I had to wait 10-30 min for, and of course, it didn\u2019t work. So now I have to call them again tomorrow and in the meantime my daughter has none of her contacts/data/pictures - nothing. I don\u2019t know if I got a lemon of a device or what but customer service has been far less than helpful (even though they\u2019re always very nice). I suggest you look at alternatives to Gabb."

          "Contenu": "This is my second time trying to get a Gabb phone to work for my children. The first time, I tried to port my 14yo from another provider and phone to Gabb's provider and phone. I tried their website and phone service, and I was never successful even with their CSR's help. I wasted about five hours of my time and the CSR's time. That was a month or two ago.The second time, I didn't even try to port a phone; I bought a Gabb phone for the 11yo who needs to carpool with his older siblings. I can't believe I tried again, but I got an ad saying the device was totally free, so I figured why not. I did actually receive a phone this time. The Gabb phone comes with lots (14!) of apps I don't want. I just want phone and text for safety and a GPS. I don't want the FM phone, video, etc. I tried to use chat support to ask how to remove these apps. Although it was before 7 pm Mountain time (when their customer service closes), their chat support was \"too busy\" to message. I emailed, and I got a response that I'd be replied to in 3-5 business days! For support! What's more, it's been five business days today, and I still haven't heard back from them! (And as far as I know, you can't delete these apps, which makes it 90% less kid-oriented than I wanted it to be.)Gabb may be great someday, but it's just not ready for prime time yet. In order to be a real phone service, you have to have real customer service. Edited on Aug 19 to add: Now the phone (which was free) won't charge. I think they probably knew there was something wrong with these phones, which is why they were free. I emailed them today to ask them what was up, and I got this email back: \"Thank you for reaching out! Your request has been received by our Gabb Experts. We aim to respond within 10 business days. We appreciate your patience.\" NOW THEY'RE UP TO 10 BUSINESS DAYS to reply to customer-service emails. INCREDIBLE.Edited on Aug 30 to add: After charging me for another month of service because they don't read their emails, I got an email saying that I would be charged $50 to \"restock\" my \"free\" phone that literally never charged. This is not to be believed."

My phone calls with my daughter usually happened in 30 second intervals between calling and having the call dropped. We worked with Gabb on these problems a number of times. Their suggestions revolved around restarting the phone, which seemed a bit odd, considering it would have to be restarted by a kid who wouldn't know the GPS isn't working, and who shouldn't have to repeatedly restart their phone in order to get through to us. We learned after the phone warranty was expired that they may have been willing to exchange our phone, but no one suggested this to us in the dozen customer service calls we put in until after the warranty was expired. We've cancelled our phone service with Gabb. We still have a watch service with them, as the watch has been more reliable.Update to this review: Gabb reached out about our experience, and tried to resolve the issue. They were apologetic, polite, and offered a small discount on the Gabb watch service we still maintain with them."

She credited me the months I had already paid for while being unable to use the watch. She also emailed me helpful links and articles to make sure I understood everything about my daughters new watch. I left that interaction feeling so much better and with a working watch!

While each interaction was polite, every email I sent was responded to by a different representative. This created a very long, drawn out and failed resolution to the initial problem. I believe Gabb could resolve this issue by assigning cases to specific representatives so it is a seamless interaction from start to end. I finally decided to call today, as a last ditch effort, before canceling my service. I spoke with Steve, who spent almost an hour on the phone with me, reading through every email and updating himself on the situation. He knew exactly what needed to be done, and went above and beyond to ensure that I was properly taken care of. He was empathic, supportive and knowledgeable. He ensured that the situation was resolved before we hung up the phone. He emailed confirmation of what was done. Speaking to him was relieving, after feeling hopeless! Steve is the reason I am still a Gabb customer today, and I hope to encounter more representatives with his demeanor and capability in the future with Gabb."
