          "Titre": "They are holding my Money hostage",
          "Contenu": "I\u2019ve never dealt with more frustrating customer service.  This company is unprofessional and has seemingly no knowledge of their own services.  I had a deposit from an invoice that was being held because they claimed I didn\u2019t submit my ID.  Nowhere in the set up of my account was I asked to submit an ID.  Even when I asked someone in customer services they just pointed me in the direction of their FAQs (which had nothing about it).  This was concerning so I decided to cancel my account and requested my money be deposited to my bank account.  They told me it would take 10 days, then on the 10th day they decided they were sending me a check instead.  Pleas keep in mind I had been communicating(or attempting to) with customer services about where my money was, everyone continued to give me vague answers and then finally blame me for \u201cnot verifying my identity\u201d (which was not true, I gave these dumb dumbs my social security, bank account, etc.).  It\u2019s been an entire friggin month!!!! They still have not sent my check for A LOT of money that I NEED!!! This is insane borderline scam behavior from an accredited financial institution.  They are holding my money hostage and at this point it almost seems out of spite.  For the love of god please don\u2019t use these morons until they fire their CEO and change their entire organization from the top down.Update:  Its December 1st and I have not received my check. I have contacted customer service again and it's been 5 hours with no response.  Rent is due today, so having that money would be great for me..."

          "Titre": "Issues with international wire transfer",
          "Contenu": "Original review: As an international contractor (non-US based) I do not recommend using Wingspan to get paid. I am currently experiencing an international payment delay of 11 days and counting.First, the intermediary bank put the transfer on hold to run additional checks. This has never happened to me during the many years I've been freelancing and getting paid via other platforms such as Upwork, Deel, and Payoneer. In fact, payments were always transferred to my account within a couple of hours.After my payment made it through the checks, it was ultimately rejected by the intermediary bank. This is the first time anything like this ever happened to me. Now I must contact the intermediary bank to understand what went wrong and no one knows how long this will take.While the Wingspan team tried to help and did respond to my emails in a timely manner, this is a mess of epic proportions that has caused me tremendous amounts of stress. If you get paid via wire transfer and don\u2019t have an account with a US bank, you\u2019re better off using Deel if possible.Update: I finally received the payment after I changed the withdrawal method to my other bank account. (Luckily I had a backup. I don't know what the solution would've otherwise been as the intermediary bank was emphatic they did not receive or reject a wire transfer to my account from Wingspan.) Changing my rating to 3 stars as the transfer to my other bank account went through in 1 business day."

Their support staff are knowledgeable, friendly and don\u2019t waste your time. In a world full of awful outsourced support this was a big positive for me."

I send them a payment to their email, they create an account and enter their bank information, and they're paid next-day. 1099s are filed automatically which has cut down our spend on accounting.We want to focus on what's important: designing generative homes for our clients, not taxes and payments."

          "Contenu": "I recently switched to Wingspan from QuickBooks to pay the ~30 contractors my startup Arka uses on a monthly basis. Long story short, Wingspan has been an absolute game changer. 1099s are automatically generated, payments are sent out in a few days or less (rather than 10 weeks), and their reporting is top notch.Wingspan\u2019s customer service has also been great. I had a couple of questions about how to send checks to contractors and they responded within minutes via email and even followed up with me a few days later to make sure that everything was sorted out.Wingspan has improved my contractor retention. By paying our contractors through Wingspan, they get access to tax withholding, accounting, benefits like Telemedicine, and their own invoicing system. I hear from our contractors that tax filing season is stressful because, more often than not, they haven't set aside enough for taxes over the year. When I pay them through Wingspan, they have the option to automatically set aside for taxes & make estimated tax payments. They feel like they have the full time (W-2) experience, without any of the hassle and financial burden on our agency.Wingspan has a 1099 management system that's easy to use and is incredibly helpful. We've been able to reduce our time spent 1099 filing from 10+ hours per week, down to about an hour every other week when we send out 1099s in bulk.TL;DR Wingspan has made my life less of a pain-in-the-ass."

As if the integrated invoicing, expense tracking, and *shouts from the rooftops* TAX withholding and quarterly filing with the IRS at two smooth clicks of a button weren\u2019t enough\u2026 If you have 1099 contractors, this has been a seamless solution to getting more done as a team. Collaboration is the very essence of my business\u2014and part of that is paying collaborators. Being able to add my team that way and divide up invoices as needed where they are paid directly, all while tracking my contractors\u2019 W9s and 1099 distribution was a huge game-changer, headache eraser, and time saver.But probably the BIGGEST way Wingspan has earned and kept my trust and business over time\u2026 The customer service. When I needed someone with prior *bigger* platforms, it was SO difficult to\u00a0get a hold of someone for help. It just felt like I was a very small dot in a large customer base. Wingspan\u2019s\u00a0team have been top notch: personal emails to troubleshoot or answer questions, relatively MUCH faster responses and resolutions, and over the last 3 years I have seen them implement feedback, fix glitches, address roadbumps, and truly constantly improve. They are ever-growing and relatively newer to the scene of business solutions, but I have built up such a confidence in the team behind the scenes.\u00a0I can\u2019t recommend Wingspan enough if you are an independent contractor, a business that works with independent contractors, or need a more intuitive, thoughtful home base that feels like your business is supported from all sides."

          "Contenu": "I have been using the services of Wingspan for quite some time now, and I must say it has been an incredibly positive experience. Their platform is exceptionally easy to use and offers a straightforward approach to managing and paying invoices. As a busy professional, I value efficiency and convenience, and Wingspan delivers on both fronts.One of the most significant advantages of using Wingspan is their consistent and timely payment of invoices. I can always rely on them to process my payments promptly, ensuring that I receive my funds when I need them. This reliability has been a breath of fresh air compared to previous experiences I've had with other invoice payment services.A standout feature of Wingspan is the comprehensive invoice history it provides. Having all my invoice records in one place is a game-changer. It eliminates the hassle of searching through emails or paper trails to find specific invoices or payment details. I can easily access my entire invoice history with just a few clicks, making my record-keeping much more organized and efficient.Another aspect that impressed me was the training they offered on submitting end-of-month invoices. The company provided informative training sessions that walked me through the process step by step. It was seamless and incredibly beneficial, especially considering the transition from my previous invoice payment service provider. The training ensured I had a smooth and stress-free experience, and I greatly appreciate the effort they put into supporting their customers.Overall, I highly recommend Wingspan to anyone seeking an effortless and reliable invoice payment solution. Their user-friendly platform, timely payment processing, comprehensive invoice history, and exceptional training make them a standout choice. Thanks to Wingspan, I can focus on my work without worrying about the complexities of invoice management and enjoy the seamless transition from invoice submission to receiving my paychecks."
