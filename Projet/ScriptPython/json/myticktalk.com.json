          "Contenu": "All of the reviews are after immediately receiving the watch. Which at first it was great. I bought this watch 13 months ago with a 1 year warranty. So of course I am ONE month over the extended warranty. My son has only used this watch FIVE times on field trips. The watch is in excellent condition zero damage. It will not turn on. I charged it for an hour tried different outlets and charging bases and still nothing. I am reading this is a common issue and that\u2019s why they have it on their FAQ and for returns. For the price I should definitely get more then 5 uses out of it. He is going on a trip today and I had planned on him wearing it and now we\u2019re stuck with nothing."

My little one was sitting by my side when checking accuracy; however, on my app, it was showing her 3-4 miles away. I tried to get some help from customer support, but it didn't work. I got tired of making something that expensive work, and in the end, I returned the product.However, along with the product itself, you need to buy a monthly plan, and that is fine. The thing is, if you decide to return the product, remember to cancel that plan. It has been showing on my account for the last four months, and when I tried to dispute it, the merchant replied that I signed the terms and conditions.That is very convenient; if you disagree with the terms and conditions, you can't use the product, right? \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude06 Anyways, beware of these merchant tricks."

The watch band keeps breaking on my daughters watch and they admitted that the watch bands are faulty. They said they are willing to replace the item each time it breaks since they know it is faulty, but they will not replace if it ever gets lost. Even though they know the bands are faulty and break. On top of that, the GPS was off by two cities and they said they can update the server but can't promise the GPS will be accurate. I am so disappointed in these watches and my experience with customer service. These were an investment for my family."

I have attempted to make this watch work for an additional 4 months so that my son could call his grandparents, etc and it is just not working.  We have exhausted all avenues of trying to get it to work and I am asking for the refund that was offered to me.  No where did anyone say there was a time in which I needed to respond to get the refund offered to me in a response to my review.  The watch does not notify of texts on androids and i've missed several important ones from my son.  Too many now have added up over the last 6 months of owning the watch that I just want a refund. A replacement will not fix the problems I've had with the watch."

It did not activate by next morning, now 3 days behind on gift giving, and was told to call back at 5 if it did not activate. It did not activate and I was told to wait until the next morning, which I did and it still did not activate. I told the rep that I no longer wanted the phone. I was ultimately refunded everything, including the overnight shipping costs. I liked the concept of the watch but never got it to work. On a side note, the size of the watch was rather large.

I notified TickTalk of this issue on January 31, 2023. They refused to help me as I couldn't take a video of my phone not getting notified from the watch.  I emailed again a week later as the issue was continuing. Since then I've had 53 emails back and forth with Support. Now they are asking for screenshots of the phone not having notifications. I have provided screenshots and a video of the app not notifying. I have provided all information from my phone and the watch and they ignore my requests for a resolution date. I am thoroughly disappointed in TickTalk - the very reason for the watch is to be able to communicate with a child. I can't communicate with them unless I refresh the app every hour to make sure I didn't miss a message.  Support has been completely unhelpful and the watch itself is a timekeeper at this point."

In the first month there were numerous times the watch was suddenly offline, would not turn on for days at a time, or needed the SIM card to be reinserted suddenly.I bought the warranty to be safe. On day 38 the watch would not turn on, would not respond to charge, nothing. At this point, I just want a return because it has failed me and my kid in too many important moments, once where he was hurt and couldn\u2019t call me, and had to run home sobbing. They said I\u2019m outside my return window and gave me some (seemingly bogus and cumbersome) instructions as to \u201creboot\u201d which did not work. It\u2019s been 30-some days and the watch has failed in MULTIPLE different ways, at least 5-7 times (which is a lot since it\u2019s only worn after school on some days) and now it is completely dead. Useless. The gps was never helpful and often times just reported to the nearest cell tower, which of course is not helpful. For a $200 product that fails completely on day 38\u2026 or even in the first year! and the customer service to basically say, woops, sorry!, that seems like a scam to me, so without warranty, I can only imagine how many completely out of luck with a bad product and no remedy. Hopefully, they honor the warranty at least for a replacement, but I honestly would feel bad even selling this to another parent. I\u2019m bummed, but if they would honor my return (for my watch under warranty), I would feel like they were at least trying to service their customers."

          "Titre": "Not durable! Son hated it",
          "Contenu": "I bought this watch for my 9 year old son. He is a typical boy and he rides his quad and dirt bike. This watch was specifically to keep track of him. First he went trailing and of course he had no service at all. So I couldn\u2019t track him. He wore the watch for a couple of weeks and both chargers ended up breaking. We then realized that we needed to move him to a different device since it was accurate and he started to hate it. I reached out to customer service and they said yes return it for a refund. I sent everything back except one charger because we threw it away. The other charger I sent back even though it was broken also. I sent back the watch, which worked just fine when we sent it back. I also sent the charms and everything that came with our order. Customer Service told me they cant send me a refund because the watch was damaged. I know that watch worked when I sent it. I personally powered it off when returning it. However this was supposed to be a 100% money back guarantee and a $30 fee for damaged product\u2026. Which the chargers were damaged. They use their terms lightly. 100% money back guarantee is a fraud. This is a KIDS watch. It wont look perfect if a child had worn it. I wont recommend this product to anyone. I have a younger child that will not be getting one these either. Im extremely disappointed about how they handled this\u2026 and NO I dont want a replacement. This product ended up not working out and not being durable."

          "Contenu": "I was so hopeful, but this is the most disappointed I\u2019ve been with a product in a long time. In the first month there were numerous times the watch was suddenly offline, would not turn on for days at a time, or needed the SIM card to be reinserted suddenly.I bought the warranty to be safe. On day 38 the watch would not turn on, would not respond to charge, nothing. At this point, I just want a return because it has failed me and my kid in too many important moments, once where he was hurt and couldn\u2019t call me, and had to run home sobbing. They said I\u2019m outside my return window and gave me some (seemingly bogus and cumbersome) instructions as to \u201creboot\u201d which did not work. It\u2019s been 30-some days and the watch has failed in MULTIPLE different ways, at least 5-7 times (which is a lot since it\u2019s only worn after school on some days) and now it is completely dead. Useless. The gps was never helpful and often times just reported to the nearest cell tower, which of course is not helpful. For a $200 product that fails completely on day 38\u2026 or even in the first year! and the customer service to basically say, woops, sorry!, that seems like a scam to me, so without warranty, I can only imagine how many completely out of luck with a bad product and no remedy. Hopefully, they honor the warranty at least for a replacement, but I honestly would feel bad even selling this to another parent. I\u2019m bummed, but if they would honor my return (for my watch under warranty), I would feel like they were at least trying to service their customers."

          "Titre": "Terrible Quality and Poor Customer Service",
          "Contenu": "Summary of a long review: if you are outside of the US, don't buy from them. The bands broke within a couple of months, and they will not honor their warranty for international buyers who purchased from Amazon, despite the stated warranty policy on their own website. The current state of the product: my defective watch is still with them, and they still insist on charging me $100 to replace it. I am still in the middle of frustrating email exchanges with their customer support. Parents, if you don't want to be in my shoes and are looking for peace of mind, take your business elsewhere.I will keep this updated until it is resolved, and the detail is as follows.--------------------------------------2nd Update (2023-09-16). From the reply below and my communication with their support, at least they implicitly walked back the claim that those purchased from Amazon are used ones. That's good to know.Now, the argument has changed: their warranty does not cover those purchased from Amazon. This is interesting because their own website stated, which I quote here, exactly the opposite: \"TickTalk smartwatches purchased from authorized third-party retailers, including Amazon and/or Walmart, are eligible for our 1-Year Limited Warranty.\" And this one-year limited warranty also extends to international buyers, as per their website: \"For international customers, you are responsible for any shipping fees, duties, and/or taxes associated with warranty claim.\" Indeed, they followed this clause to the letter, so that I paid out of my pocket to ship the defective watch back to them (see my original review).Last issue: are the broken bands covered under limited warranty? My watch was purchased in Dec 2022, during the defective holiday batch. It falls into the category of \"basic hardware defect in workmanship.\" On their own Facebook community page, the company announcement dated May 5th, 2023 also stated the limited warranty covers the broken bands in the affected batches, and their policy is to offer a free replacement. So my first question is, why am I charged $100 to repair a watch with a basic hardware defect covered under a limited warranty?My second question is, why does a customer here, a frustrated parent, need to spend so much time writing countless emails to communicate with a company about their own defective product? How far are they willing to go to avoid taking responsibility for their own defective products? This is pretty ironic for a product advertised to offer peace of mind for parents. I am documenting all these back-and-forths with them to show how much frustration a customer needs to go through to cover their basic rights. I hope the other parents do not need to go through the same and can find their peace of mind from some other companies.I am eager to see their reply to my points above.--------------------------------------First update (2023-09-13): Now the support team tells me that this watch from Amazon is not new but a used one, so they don't have any liability to repair or replace it. They inferred that my watch must be used because it is sold at a discount. My purchase price tag is around USD 200, which is higher than the price on their website. The Amazon receipt also states that this is a new product. I am no longer angry, I am now just curious to see how far they will go to avoid honoring their warranty. For any parents watching this, I will keep you posted.--------------------------------------The original review:In short, if you live outside the US, don't buy from them. The watch broke within a few months; they do not cover return shipping, and eventually, they charged me $100 to replace their faulty watch while all within the warranty period. The details are as follows:After a couple of months of everyday use, one band broke. At the time, we thought, fine, it is a kid's watch, and it breaks. We glued it back, and after another month, the other band also broke. In the meantime, the speaker sometimes works and sometimes does not. The watch also fails to charge occasionally due to a poorly designed magnetic charger.After the second band broke, we Googled online and discovered this is a common defect of their watches. We contacted customer service to ask for a replacement. To add icings on the top, they refuse to provide free shipping for customers outside of the US. Ultimately, we have to pay to return their defective watch.This is absolutely the last time that I purchase from them."

          "Contenu": "Update to Response: Your reply lets EVERYONE know how much of a Dishonest company you are. Watch is past the 30 day return window and Amazon wants to charge a $40 restocking fee to return you DEFECTIVE device. But you know that!!------------If you are buying this to keep tabs on your Childs location in case of emergency. DO NOT BUY!If you are buying this watch so your child can reach you in an EMERGENCY. DO NOT BUY!If you want your child just to be able to tell time buy them $20 kids watch.If you are buying this because your kids are tech savvy and like playing with devices like this. DO NOT BUY!After some company research it appears this company... \"TICKTALK TECH\" was operating under TICKTALK, INC and was suspended by the State of California so as a work around they registered the same company under a slightly different name to get around their state suspension. Suspended - FTB is the official Status!What does FTB suspended status mean?A business entity is typically suspended, or forfeited, by Franchise Tax Board (FTB) for failure to meet its tax requirements, such as File a state tax return. Pay. Taxes.Read on to find out why all this is relevant to my review...I thought for the price I was buying a product I could rely on to track my 9-year-olds location. As a Parent and the current state of our country with the things going on at schools. My wife and I wanted a means to contact our son and for he to be able to contact us in Emergency. I as a parent was really sold on the GPS tracking. Come to find out the GPS tracking NEVER and I mean NEVER works. It is either COMPLETY inaccurate or never works. Will say offline all the time. If you go to their FB page, you can see MANY if not MOST complaining about the same thing.The company will give you a bunch of bogus excuses and bogus remedies. Things like poor reception and poor battery life or just blame your kid themselves. My son charges his watch EVERYDAY after school so always very well charged when he is wearing it. As for reception well the fence in my backyard literally separates our property from my son\u2019s school. At home great reception and at school the same as at home as it is less than 100 yards away from my backdoor. Both at home and at school the GPS never puts him remotely close to wear he is REALLY at. Sometimes it\u2019s so bad it has him across town MILES away! Now let\u2019s get to the company. A couple months ago the operating system of the watch was sent an update with Bricked the watch. Meaning it became frozen and unresponsive and stuck on startup screen!I called the company and thought some simple trouble shooting would fix it. Nope! Instead, I was basically told we are aware of the DEFECT, and you must send it back. This of course was after 30 minutes of back and forth and my common sense blowing their excuses out of the water. I then stated I would be leaving BBB and States attorney complaints. Now generally when it gets to this point with a BAD company, they will then try to do the RIGHT thing. NOPE not this company. Instead, I was told by the Manager I was threating her personally and was abruptly hung up. I filled out the warrant form sent it back and waited two weeks to get it back. Upon arrival they forgot to put the sim card door in the return box. So, they sent me two in the mail. Crazy thing is they were the wrong size. I then had to wait another week to get the right size. Now today my son comes home from school his watch is flashing all types of colors and not working AGAIN.Turns out another update was sent to watch while he was at school, and it bricked the watch AGAIN. So, I call again. It appears they are aware of this DEFECT and their ONLY solution is every time the watch is updated over the 5g network and not Wi-Fi this is likely to happen. So, you then must let the watch sit a couple days, so the battery drains and the watch turn off. This is their fix. Not to recall and fix their defective product.I was told we must monitor our kids and make sure they only try to update the watch when they are being supervised by an adult to be sure the watch is on WI-FI. As a Parent we all know, best of luck with that with how savvy our kids are with electronics today. I told the Manager this is not a solution and I need either new updated version of the watch or a REFUND. I was essentially in not so many words told to go pound sand. I was then asked by the MANAGER if I am an UNHAPPY person? She asked are you married. What makes you suck and unhappy person? Now normally this would seem INSANE to come from a manager of a company to a paying customer dealing with a DEFECTIVE product. But since being hung up and told I was threatening the person last time when I mentioned BBB and States attorney complaints. This surprising did not shock me!So, as of now I am stuck with an OVERPICED toy that will need to trouble shoot my kids watch after every update and not know where my kid is at."

What they have is a movement tracker.  The steps are WAY off.  I reached out on this and was told \"if the hand is shaken it may be counted as a step\".  These are kids, they are always moving.  It was giving my son steps as we were sitting in the car.  For a $200 watch I'm extremely disappointed this is not accurate and even more disappointed that the company is falsely advertising this is a feature they offer."

You mean this isn\u2019t covered by the warranty? Apparently not. They told me I can buy the extended warranty. How can a watch band not be replaceable? If the thing fails immediately after purchase they should stand behind it. Period. This is less than 10 days old. Apparently the warranty that comes with the watch is meaningless. So now I have to decide whether to send it back and hope they deem it replaceable or whether to try to superglue this brand new watch back together so my son can continue to use it. My son has not been hard on this watch. He just wears it while going about his normal business. Without a functioning band the watch is nearly useless."

Three days later, both cameras have moisture under lenses and watch will not function. He has not been near any water while wearing it but had spent most of the day before outside in high humidity weather. When we contacted tech support, they stated rudely that they could not do anything as they are to busy with other customers. They did say that they could do a onetime replacement but could not give a refund due to water damage not being covered by warranty. We plead our case to them that normal moisture from a child\u2019s rust should not constitute water damage and that we wanted a refund. Their response was simply \u201cNo\u201d. I would not recommend this product to anyone living in the southern area of the United States."

          "Contenu": "I loved the 3. Great watch with great connectivity. The 4!!! What the hell happened. The watch has a few apps, and they crash. Good luck playing music, I was never able to get it to work. ALSO I bought the watch to call my kid. Guess what? The new watch was downgraded for connectivity. My favorite gripe, When a kid doesn't answer the phone, you can't leave a message because the kid hasn't set up voicemail. But guess what? There IS no voicemail. The kid will never be able to set it up. Why would you do this? What is the point? just say, there is no way to leave a voice mail message- goodbye. I wanted this to work sooo much. The previous one was great, but I didn't get a full year out of it, doubt I'ld get a year out of a watch that doesn't really work right out of the gate. Why does the watch disconnect from the wifi so frequently? Why does the music app not work? Why am I not able to call my kid in the Bay Area with fabulous reception?. Great idea- but it got too clunky and non functional. The customer service is fabulous! Thats the other part that pisses me off, They care about their customers and I wanted to be one. Just need a watch that does what you claim it does. Call me as most reviews are fake. Tony 6504443271"

For a watch just for calling it works good but for gps your better off looking for something else. I am very un happy with the watch mainly because I mainly bought it for gps tracking to know where my kids is but it don't do that. The plus side is I can call him or voice message him anytime but that's about all the watch is good for I'm very unsatisfied with the watch don't waste your money if you plan on using the gps tracker! If just for talking it works ok but could use a little better speaker to be able to hear them better"

As of today, that account is still \u201cpending\u201d due to a technical issue on AT&T\u2019s end.  While I appreciate this may be out of TickTalk\u2019s control, there could have been measures taken at the onset of AT&T\u2019s issues by communicating to your customers at the point of carrier selection and only allowing T-Mobile SIM cards until AT&T\u2019s issue was resolved.  So after nearly a week, I have a $200 watch that is useless to me and my child; this certainly does not meet my expectations.  I did have positive email interaction with TickTalk\u2019s customer service in 2/24/23, but beyond that there\u2019s been no communication as to the status of AT&T\u2019s issue, nor any other option provided to me other than to wait."

Upgraded to tick talk 4 hoping for improved battery life which is stated by sales rep and website to be 100 hours but it\u2019s 100 hours in standby/airplane mode which was divulged after purchase. The watch during normal use still only provides 4 to 6 hours of battery life. In addition I have 2 watches and only 1 tracks the accurate location in real time the other lags 3 to 5 miles on a trip behind if it even registers in close proximity. Also location is not concise as the tt2 e.g. tt2 showed kids in home now watches show they are in strip mall parking lot 500 feet away. Disappointed in the upgrade and marketing tactics are below board"

The kids like them.  Within a month, the watch band broke on 1 watch.  The way the band connects to the body is a little odd; it can't be laid flat and it's not obvious if you can even replace the band.  I don't think it's a very good design.  On a previous kids' smartwatch we replaced the band several times and never had an issue.  In this case, the connection point broke into pieces, not just the band or pin.  I contacted TickTalk about a replacement.  It has been almost 3 weeks and I still don't have a replacement; I'm told it has shipped.  Every email would go 1-2 days before getting a response.  I tried the chat on the site with no response.  I was able to talk to a person when I called.   Overall, extremely disappointed in the service.  This was a very simple transaction; most companies could have handled it in a couple of days.  Waiting days for responses to email simply isn't acceptable."

Once in a while I\u2019ll get a call from the watch when my son hasn\u2019t actually called me. The watch could benefit from a redesign to make it less easy for a child to inadvertently make an accidental call. 3. The watch sends a lot of notifications (updates, etc.) which can make the wearer think that they are getting incoming texts, which can be disruptive. The watch is water resistant and seems pretty rugged. The band has held up and not needed replacement. In general, we are pretty happy with it."

          "Contenu": "This is my third time buying a TickTalk watch.  The first was a TickTalk 3 for my older son.  The battery life of that model was terrible.  We then bought a TickTalk 4 for my younger son.  It worked pretty well, but sometimes it would stop working or charging, and after trouble shooting we got it to work again.  We uses it mostly for texting or calling to communicate with my son to pick up from school, and it served its purpose.  But after 1-1/2 years, the watch stopped charging for good.  My only option at that point was to mail it in at my cost to have the company test it, and if they could not revive it, then I could pay $100 to have it replaced.  A new one cost $150 with the Easter discount.  So I decided to buy a new one at that point, in order to have a working watch sooner, and with the cost to ship the old one back it would not have been far off from $150.  Honestly, I cannot wait until my younger son is old enough to have a phone.  At least then it would be more reliable and won't die so soon."

Even on standby it won't last a day...my daughter uses it a few times and the battery is dead in 4 hours or less.  Can't give it more than 3 stars...close to greatness but falls short."

Typically their location is off by several blocks in Seattle.  One of the reasons we got the watch is because they will be going on a road trip with their grandparents this summer and based on what we\u2019ve seen I don\u2019t think the location feature is going to be very insightful.Wish the location function was better."

I also have not heard back from them for almost 1.5 wks after I sent pics of the watch box and the shipping box to them.

To me this is fraud.If I hear back and have the power base sent I will consider reevaluating to a 5 star rating.  As I said the watch itself is awesome for my 8 yr old. No need for a phone he may loss or drop and break and the tracking is pretty accurate.  Works very well with T-Mobile."

If I could figure out how to get a Velcro style band on there they would wear it every day. Features are great. I considered TickTalk 3 to fix the band situation but I haven\u2019t heard great things in the screen sensitivity. Plus, I already paid for these.  It\u2019s a bummer bc I really want to love them. If anyone finds a band solution, please let me know. I\u2019d be happy to shell out another $25 to make them more comfortable and on/off friendly. I\u2019m considering creating some type of band cover that Velcros but I don\u2019t know if it would be worth it. I\u2019ve told them that I\u2019m going to cancel red pocket if they don\u2019t start wearing them more\u2026 giving it another month. How is this great tech worth it if it\u2019s so uncomfortable?

He has to hold the watch phone right next to his mouth in order to be heard and that was not the case with the 3.  Also even though the phone is on silent, a beep is still made when a call is hung up. That is NOT silent mode. Please fix that.  I'm much prefer the external watch design of The ticktalk three because the tick tock four has so many little nooks and crannies that collect with dirt. The speaker on the floor is also wide open to collecting dirt.  I miss the Velcro band.Overall the telephone reception of the watch from a signal perspective, and from a programming perspective, seems to be superior.I don't like not being able to select what stations my son can listen to on iheartradio. Even the family app includes negative cultural references that I don't appreciate. There needs to be a selection of a Christian channel.  Many Christian families use this watch to safeguard their children from negative side effects of other phones.  Offer a Christian music station please. Thanks"

It\u2019s going on 3 weeks and still have not received my wire or watch. I\u2019m so upset because I cannot get a hold of anybody on the phone and I keep getting an email saying it was delivered.

This was a big problem with other watches always sliding around. He could have it for his exact size wrist. The battery life was VERY short. He needed to plug it in EVERY day or it would die. The charging port is awful. If it's not in the absolute perfect position it doesn't charge. After 10 months the watch stopped charging after installing a new update. Customer service was awful. Took days to get back to me. Promised 2-3 day turn around time and still nothing almost 2 weeks later. We liked the watch but was really frustrated with customer service saying the watch had water damage when the watch continued to work just fine, it just wouldn't charge after the update. After reading other reviews I realized the batteries all had problems and there were a lot of complaints. Clearly there's an issue with them that needs to be addressed. Sounds like the warranty is utter crap too. How frustrating."

I recommend this watchThe phone is huge, the music app never works, when you go to send a message the contacts do not autopopulate, only 1 person. The call reception is worse than the previous generation and that's its main function. PLUS!!!! you only have a few interactions with the staff to get help. I think they're done dealing with me so I'm left with this POS!!! could've done great, the concept is fabulous, no games. Theres too many yes people in that office who aren't giving you guys good advice moving forward, but whatever. I'm sure everyone wants to be surrounded by people who think their ideas are great, while destroying the product. In an effort to keep your job. problem is, is that's its still probably the best in class in that cztagory, feels like accepting subpar or wishing I can buy a previous generation"

Child must have quiet surroundings in order to hear me at all3) Geofencing (like Gizmo has) so I can be alerted when my child goes beyond set boundaries 4) Auto answer (like Gizmo has) so I can speak to child instantly Please add these features to updates on TickTalk4!What I love:1) Super hearing feature! Gizmo doesn\u2019t have this, although their auto answer feature might accomplish something similar. 2) GPS tracker (though address shown when he\u2019s home is always next door \ud83d\ude2c, so accuracy could be an issue in an emergency). All watches may struggle with total accuracy. 3) My kid loves the 2-sided camera, allowing for fun picture taking and video calls. This sets it apart from Gizmo and other watches!4) Comes in black instead of ONLY retina-burning blue and pink like Gizmo offer. Note: cheapest phone plan available is $10/mo, so when considering the expense, you will not only be paying for the watch, but also an annual fee of at least $120...which is certainly worth lowering the risk of my child going missing, but still something to keep in mind."

However, there are some features I wish it had and some I wish it didn\u2019t have. It would be better if the contacts we approved to contact the watch did not have to download the app and create an account just to text and FaceTime. I understand the level of security but when you have over 20 contacts for your child, it gets tiring when everyone has to make an account and pair their phones to the watch. It\u2019s just too many steps. It would be better if they could just contact the watch without having to do the whole set up. I also don\u2019t like that we can\u2019t see and review the messages between the other contacts. Since everyone has their own login, me as the admin, is unable to see what and who my child is texting. That\u2019s a level of security that I think is very important. How are we supposed to monitor what is going on if we can\u2019t review and see what is being said. Also, the in call volume on the watch is too low. There is no way to turn it up higher once it reached max level in a call and myself and children can\u2019t hear the other person on the phone. Lastly, the contacts on the watch. If my child is scrolling to find someone specific to call and accidentally touches another name, it calls that person automatically. There should be a confirmation asking if they want to call that contact so it gives them the option to back out and keep scrolling. Overall, the watch is okay, if the features I mentioned isn\u2019t important to a potential customer then I would recommend it."

If I'm releasing a new version of my tech device, I can't imagine not having live tech support for 4 days after 1000s of these watches are opened by eager children on Christmas.  We then dialed in Monday and the chat-support has seemed to be pretty clearly totally overwhelmed.  They're supplying us with a return label and are offering to replace her band with a color she's more excited about, so that's great.  We'll just see if the return goes smoothly (crossed fingers).  If so, and the new watch is delivered as promised and works like my other daughter's, then this review would go up to 4 stars -- when working, the watches seem really good."

          "Contenu": "First, I want to start out saying, we love TickTalk. We have 3. Two TickTalk 3s and now a 4. We\u2019re customers for the long haul! The Kickstarter campaign and communication about the product were tremendous! Shipping was great. We love the easy setup and the app is GREAT!I do have some feedback about the 4 and things were noticing.1. When my son makes a call or receives a call, the screen then dims and he\u2019s never able to hit the \u201cend\u201d button. Even if he presses the wake button, it doesn\u2019t take him to the call screen. It just takes him to all of his other options, so the call just keeps going in the background. Also when he\u2019s on a screen, there isn\u2019t a back button or anything to get out of the screen he\u2019s in. Maybe we\u2019re missing something.2. Our pictures do not appear on his screen when we call him or he calls us. It just says our names even though we\u2019re added as contacts with pictures (like I said, we have the 3s and it works on those. The 4 is set up the same way with our pictures). I called when we first got it, and they said this is a glitch and an update would be released within the week to fix it but it\u2019s still happening.3. While I love the improvement and higher quality of the watch and screen (MUCH easier to press options \u263a\ufe0f), are there talks of a screen protector? Within a day of my son wearing it, there were significant scratches. Since, we\u2019ve put liquid glass on it but I\u2019m not sure how well that\u2019ll do.Just some questions. No concerns \u263a\ufe0f Thank you for your amazing product!"

          "Contenu": "The version that ended up ordered was on the AT&T network instead of T-Mobile. The interface and cart details could be improved to avoid this. Then I got a T-Mobile SIM but couldn't activate it on the TickTalk Wireless site. Turns out that although the SIM was white-colored and the QR code sticker took me to the TickTalk Wireless site, it was a Red Pocket SIM. There was no visual or evident indication of the Red Pocket network. How would a customer know this? After waiting the whole weekend to talk to support on Monday, I was then thrown at the Red Pocket site and basically told to \"figure it out... you have to call Red Pocket if you encounter any problems\". Not a great customer experience. I was then able to create an account and figure things out on my own. Red Pocket's interface is bad. The overall activation experience is cumbersome and not user friendly. It would be nice if customers could have the ability to choose the wireless network provider when making their purchase or if TickTalk could properly identify the SIM card or provide instructions to identify it.The overall apps/sites experience is also not great. You have 3 different usernames/passwords: one for the TickTalk site (orders), another for TickTalk Wireless, and then another one for the mobile app. The whole thing is complicated if you are not tech savvy. Also, the login screen in the mobile app is not password manager friendly.That said, there are not many comparable smartwatches out there, so customers (like me) do their best to navigate these user experience issues. Once you configure everything, I can't deny that the smartwatch has been pretty reliable. Parental controls are a little tricky to understand at first, but they have some very good options. It's only a week of use, but the device has already been a game changer in terms of communicating and knowing where our kid is. The group chat feature has been the best way to simplify communications between our kid and both of us parents. The charger is just a USB A cable with a special terminal connector that plugs in the back of the watch. It would be nice if the USB wall charger was provided with the device. After reading so many reviews and looking at all options available (in 2022), my experience is that the TickTalk 4 seems the best option to give our kid a phone-like device with parental controls without actually handing them a phone."

          "Contenu": "I contacted technical support through email when one of our Tick Talk 4 watches kept disconnecting from the network while he was at school.  This made it unable to track him and caused the watch to stay in do not disturb mode (DND) until we restarted it.  We have a second Tick Talk 4 for our other child that works without issue while he is at the same school.The response from technical support was that I should reset the watch and start from scratch.  I was not pleased with this answer as it didn't make sense as the watch worked perfectly when it was not in DND mode.  I then asked if I could restore my son's data from the T-Cloud when I reset it, but I was told that I couldn't and my son would lose all of his settings and photos.The next thing that happened was the watch just shut off and wouldn't turn back on.  When I contacted technical support again, I was told that it may be because his watch was out of data.  As you can understand, this was a frustrating suggestion and I responded to let them know that.I was then told that I could send the watch in for inspection, but that if the watch has any water damage, then we have to pay $100.  This seems like a setup since the watch never worked right from the first day we received it, yet this allows the customer service department to declare it is our fault without proof.  The other issue we now have is that we are without a watch for our son during the Summer.  I use this to allow him to go to the park and visit friends so I may keep an eye on him while I work from home.  It may be several weeks (they use USPS for mailing) for the broken watch to be received and the new watch to arrive at our house.  I would make the following recommendations to Tick Talk 4 due to my situation:1.  When a watch doesn't work right from the beginning, please do not threaten a $100 fine for water damage.  2. Send a replacement watch while the damaged watch is being sent back.  You could always put a $100 hold on the customer's card while you inspect it.  This allows the customer to use the product while they wait for the damaged watch to be inspected."

My kiddo absolutely loves the texting feature and that there is a kid-friendly spooky podcast through the I-heart-radio built-in app. The only downside so far (aside from battery life) is that it's a little too easy for him to accidentally call me, and on the first day, it happened at least 10-15 times.

The tracking isn\u2019t as reliable as I had hoped (it showed him states away today when he was on the school bus headed home), but I love the ability to reach him immediately when necessary! I don\u2019t care for some of the settings, as I thought he\u2019d be able to FaceTime his friends that also have the watch (he can\u2019t FaceTime or text them). There is a learning curve that I\u2019m still working on, but overall the service has been good and the ability to reach my child has been wonderful. The watch seems durable-although bulky, but does seem like it will withstand a child for a while."

The second aspect is GPS tracking, which is inaccurate both outdoors and indoors where the phone is connected to the family's Wi-Fi network.In the dedicated application, after each action I perform, the message \"operation successful\" appears and remains on the screen until I dismiss it. I would prefer it to automatically disappear after 1-2 seconds.I don't know how other models behave, that's why I'm only talking about my experience with these watches.

          "Contenu": "For the watch, I will give 4 stars. It has met our expectations and done the job we wanted it to.We gave this to my elementary school aged son. As parents, we like that we can keep in touch with him easily and can see his location if there are any concerns. Being strapped to his wrist, there is lower risk of losing it compared to a smartphone.The watch is not as full featured as an Apple or Android smart watch, but it's appropriate for this age group. It is also rugged and the watch itself has withstood the rigors of an active 10 year old. I recommend purchasing the screen protector to mitigate scratching to the watch face itself.My son enjoyed the additional independence the watch afforded, and particularly enjoyed taking pictures on the built-in camera.The reasons why I'd not give the watch 5 stars are that the strap broke (I see other reviewers had the same issue), and backups are not automatic. We lost my son's pictures due to the watch failing to power on right around the time I was sending it in for the strap issue. I was advised that we should run the backup weekly or so to avoid this in the future.Tiffiny has been great to work with as we navigated the warranty process for addressing the broken strap and non-powering watch issues. She has responded promptly to my questions and has come to a fair resolution. Sometimes devices break, and it's frustrating, but having effective customer service smooths over those issues."

Because it was the weekend we were unable to fix it with customer service. Monday I did the live chat and they quickly activated it. Natasha did a great job with customer service. Setup on the app is easy and I like the parental controls. Functionality: my child loves the watch, he thinks it\u2019s so cool. Messages work well but I wish that the messages would go straight to my phone instead of the app but I understand the security reasons. It would be nice if the app notification on my phone gave me a preview of the message. GPS works well to see where he is at. Overall we are pleased with the TickTalk 4 watch so far and look forward to using it more."

We have used the face feature several times and it almost always works great. I wish it stayed on longer then 3 minutes though. Oh! I forgot about reminders - I set daily reminders to keep him I'm schedule while I'm working. I love that part tooBefore ordering, I was hesitant about the size of the watch. I promise it's not as big as it looks online. It fits my 10 year olds arm just fine.I went with 4 stars instead of 5 just because the band/attachment broke after less then a month of use. According to my son, he didn't do anything to break it (granted he doesn't always tell the truth). However, as a product made for kids it, should be able to handle wear and tear pretty well."

Customer service is also really great.  Setting up the first one took me a bit of time and the 2nd one was easy. Lots of good features and I like that there\u2019s no games or apps on here aside from camera, group and single texting options and different themes for the home screen and app display which are cool, colorful and fun. They have gotten lots of compliments on them and when we explain to them how it works, it\u2019s even more impressive. It was easy to add family members and a few friends. But I learned that in order for family members to contact the watch, they must have the TickTalk app on their phone as well. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s simple enough to set up.  The only issue I have been having is when my kids are in school, they don't always show the accurate location.  My daughter was in Hawaii the other day according to her watch. I am not sure what is causing this however, I still think these watches are a great investment. Also, the reception in one of the kids classrooms isn\u2019t that great so it\u2019s constantly searching for a connection and draining the battery\ud83d\ude0f.  You can't put a price on your child's safety so I am happy to know, that we can communicate and I would definitely recommend this to family\u2019s with young children as an alternative option to cellphones."

          "Contenu": "I was trying to decide between the Gizmo 2 and the SyncUp at first however the reviews on those watches were not great.  Most reviews stated bad call quality and spotty GPS which are the main purpose of kids GPS watches, so I was a bit disappointed.  That led me to do some research on other options and I am glad I did.  TickTalk is different as you do not used a typical watch line addon via your cellular service, it uses a full cell phone connection line, which TickTalk offers for the same price as it would have been to add on a watch line to my cellular plan.  The reason for this is that this uses more data than the other guys and this leads to a more stable connection, better gps and clearer voice calls.  This also allows the watch to do video calls which is very cool.  The watch has of great features that include 2 cameras (my son loves this), the ability for an adult to lock the phone to just a clock screen via the app during school hours if you want (I love this), and ingoing/outgoing calls only to approved people who have downloaded the ticktalk app. I gave it 4 stars as there 2 drawbacks in my opinion, the size of the watch and its not waterproof.  The watch is big so if you have a child with a smaller wrist this might be an issue.  The watch only has a IP67 rating so it will be ok if it gets wet for a short time but swimming/showering with the watch is not recommended.  I would definately recommend this over the other main GPS watches for kids due to better overall call quality and better GPS stability for tracking."

          "Contenu": "We researched a bunch of different kids watches. This was the only watch that had everything we wanted. I'm able to call, text, video call even and she's able to do the same. This watch even has voice to text capabilities so you don't just have the preset texts which is amazing. I did get the prepaid T-Mobile sim with the purchase, but decided to just add it to your T-Mobile account as another line instead. So far I feel like the watch is well worth it. My kid loves the I heart music feature and we bought Bluetooth headphones that she can listen and make phone calls on. The music feature seems to cut out a lot and visit extremely clear, but hey this is just an extra feature,but definitely one reason she wanted this one. We did have an issue with the GPS showing her several miles away from where we were, watch in my hand. I don't know why it showed her being somewhere we had never taken the watch, as we had just said it up a couple of hours before. I tried to update the GPS and did the live tracking feature and it still said she was in that spot, but after I rebooted it, it finally updated the GPS to the correct location.That is a major concern to me because that is one of the main reasons I bought this watch, so that I could know where she is at all times. If the GPS is off by several miles, that's a problem. An exact location off by just a few blocks is expected, but not that far off. We just set the watch up yesterday, so hopefully it won't do that again and we will have better luck with the GPS for the future. Overall I'm very happy with this purchase as long as the GPS works correctly and I'm considering getting more for my other children."

The reviews on those watches were not great with the main issue being spotty GPS and bad call quality.  As those are the main purpose for the watch I kept searching to see if a better alternative was available.  The best reviews on a kids watch was for the TickTalk and after getting the watch I can see why.  The watch provides a much more stable and  clear connection than my sons friends watch which is because you have to get a full cellular plan on this phone.  TickTalk offers the cellular plan for the price of what a watch plan would cost me with my cell provider.  I ordered the watch directly from TickTalk as they were running a good sale and as I wanted to talk to customer service as I had questions about the features and connection requirements.  I talked directly to a person!  Not a voice command service, which drives me nuts, and the service representative was very helpful as well as very polite.  Love when you can speak with someone in customer service who knows what they are talking about.  The watch has great features with 2 cameras, incoming/outgoing calls to only approved contacts who have to have the TickTalk app and be approved by a parent, and the ability to lock the phone via the parent app to a watch face which is very useful during school hours! The only cons I have noted is the size, this is a large watch, bigger than my smart watch and it is only IP67 rated which hopefully will not be an issue if my child remembers to take it off before swimming.  These 2 cons are the reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5.  IMO this is a best GPS tracking watch available right now for kids.Thanks TickTalk"

The little paper that came with the watch doesn't explain the most basic thing about the watch: what do the 2 silver and red buttons do? How to get to the settings screen on the watch (you're supposed to swipe left a few times)? How to put the sim card in?3. Poor Q&A from untrained support. I asked what the red button do, support answered \"look at this youtube video\" which doesn't even talk about the button at all. When I told them the video was not helpful and a waste of my time, there was no apology. Only then did they give me the answer they should have given in the first place.4. Price is the steepest, which would be fine if documentation and support was a bit better.Pros:1. The software and hardware is pretty good. Call quality good. Interface good (once you know to swipe left to access other screens!)2. Location service accurate.3. Affordable service plan."

A minor issue is that the gps isn\u2019t always accurate, but with a refresh or two\u2026it corrects itself. The first time this happened, I panicked, because it appeared my son was in a neighborhood near his day camp\u2026instead of at camp.  He was actually safe and sound at camp though.  My biggest issue, is that the watch stopped working spontaneously 3 separate times in a 2 month period, for no explicable reason. The screen would go dark, and then we\u2019d get a blue screen...lasting a day or two. Some of the features may or may not work during that time.  Like, I could call\u2026and it would ring, but he couldn\u2019t answer.  There were no icons displayed. The most disturbing incident was when my son tried to call me, and the watch stopped working as he was trying to call.  Because we were abruptly disconnected\u2026I stopped what I was doing and drove to his camp location. He was in tears, and the staff was concerned, because they\u2019d never seen him so emotional.  He told me he needed me and couldn\u2019t reach me.  I\u2019m glad he was in a safe environment when it happened\u2026but it made us question the reliability of the watch.   We kept wearing the watch, but it happened two additional times. Once\u2026while he was at home with me, shortly after putting the watch on.  We were preparing to leave the house. He looked down\u2026and it was the blue screen of inoperability again. That is the last time we used it.Customer service responded quickly.  Sent us a shipping label for us to return it. It took me a while to send it back, because my son left his portable charger a a family members home\u2026and we couldn\u2019t find it for the return. Once we found it, it was still within the warranty period, so I returned it. They sent the same watch back with new chargers\u2026saying they couldn\u2019t replicate the charging issue (that I never reported nor had an issue with). When I informed them that there was never a charging issue\u2026they then said they couldn\u2019t identify a problem, but they updated the operating system.  Hopefully the watch doesn\u2019t have an issue again, because the warranty period is coming to an end.  I can only assume this is a defect of the product\u2026because they did not replace the watch, and my only experience has been problematic.  Because of this, I do not recommend this product. It has not been reliable. I\u2019d have recommended it had it functioned properly consistently. I\u2019m still working with customer service (as they remain responsive) to remedy this issue.  I will update my review if there are any changes.Update: There is a lifetime warranty on hardware defects.  So I have increased my rating from 2 stars to 4 stars.  Hopefully with the OS update, there will he no more issues with the watch."

The best part is you can use almost any service you choose so you aren't forced to pay for an expensive phone plan. I wish the watch was not quite as bulky but I believe it is best for kids to have a well protected watch while they are outside playing. This company has excellent customer service and I will continue to recommend this product to friends."

Tick Talk customer service responded very quickly when I contacted them about the problem and made the repair process simple and speedy. Overall, a much better experience than when my son had a Gizmo watch. I would definitely recommend!"

I can track him when he's out playing with friends or riding his bike which provides us a greater level of safety. The watch is very intuitive and easy for him to operate, he loves it so far! I am also hoping (especially with the fact that he had to earn the watch) it will provide a good opportunity for him to learn about personal responsibility and taking care of possessions."

          "Contenu": "So far (less than a week) we have two watches for our kids. This is our second purchase of this type of smart watch. The TickTalk has more than enough features: secure calling texting, GPS, kid friendly, music, pedometer, camera, ect. For us, the security, GPS, and the reception are most important. Potential Cons: price point is higher, monthy service only (no discounted year subscription offered), also you must buy warranty to get wear and tear replacement/ fixed such as watch band, screen, water damage. It would be nice if this was included in original packaging at least in the first year as this is a product for kids."

I feel like TickTalk has captured everything I wanted to help me have access to my kids when I\u2019m worried about them and provide them with the feeling of security knowing they can reach me whenever they need me. I also love the photo features. The one thing I wish they\u2019d offer is an option for a softer/smaller wristband for my tiny kindergartener. Her watch slides slightly on the smallest setting and it bothers her. But she is very small for her age too."

Parents can also add any additional phone number to the list. There is emergency button for rapid communication as well. Teachers allowed my kids to carry their watches on their wrist at all times even though we have \"no electronic devices policy\".

I highly recommend this product to other families who are looking for a way to give their kids more independence without having a cell phone."

We travel for work and stay in campgrounds most of the time, this allows him to go to the playground by himself for a short time and we are able to see exactly where he is at. (Not that this Momma bear still doesn't go down and check on him anyway) this give him a little bit of independence. He loves being able to call his Grandparents, his Aunt and his older brother when he wants."

They sent us a new watch immediately after they received the broken one, it is rare to see companies that stand behind their product like that!"
