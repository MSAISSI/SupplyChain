Now my hash rate slowly drops WAY below what it was. We are talking 30% lower. And there doesn't seem to be a way to downgrade when it was working well above spec. I use an ethernet connection as well. Way overpriced for the hash rate and now it's broken. Customer service hasn't been any help."

I have been working with Zeeshan for the last couple of weeks because my mars lander's raspberry pi zero stopped working. Not only did he reach out almost daily to see how I was doing, he worked with me to first try and fix the problem so I would not have to send it in and be with out it. He even went as far as to put me in touch with the CEO. Just amazing. Unfortunately, we were not able to resolve my issue this way, so he immediately had me return the raspberry pi to have it evaluated. He keep me informed throughout the entire process (when he received it and how things we going). As soon as he was able to establish the problem, he immediately informed me of the issue and sent me a new raspberry pi. But not only did he send me the new raspberry pi, he made sure I got the new one up and running and everything back to where it was before it went down. I am a long time customer and will remain one for even longer. Thank you Zeeshan for the amazing customer service!james"

The miner itself was easy to get going and is quiet. It is actually the perfect way to mine Bitcoin at home and has been made easier for first-time users. Even though the chances are slim at finding a Bitcoin block with such a small hashrate, you are also not spending a lot of money on electricity to have your hand in the game. The fact that it is quiet is another bonus you don't often get with Bitcoin miners. If you have expensive electricity and don't like noise but you want to be part of the Bitcoin ecosystem, this miner is THE way to do it. Oh and it's much easier than dealing with a stick miner and mining software and running a computer 24/7. Win/Win"

Of the 3 fans I purchased, one produces a loud vibration buzz. The 7-port USB hub's structure also produces loud vibration noise when any of the fans is running (louder with all 3 on), thus requiring specific placement with additional dampening/suppression to prevent it from vibrating as much and making the loud buzz noise that it does on its own when placed upright directly on a solid surface.EDIT 2/26/23: Bitcoin Merch sent me a fan to replace the one that has the excessive vibration and noise issue, and the new fan works quite well with no issues. I very much appreciate Idan's response and action to send me a replacement fan. When I wrote the review, I had not reached out to Bitcoin Merch yet to notify them of the issue, but they seem to be on top of things and took action based on my review of the items and before I had the chance to contact them about the issue. This is how one ensures repeat customers."
