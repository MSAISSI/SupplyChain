And he doesn\u2019t have Internet for anything else in the house. The staff had me make an appointment for Monday for us to come back to Tucson go to his house and reset some things. This is not gonna work for us. If it was working before it should work all the time with  No problem. We have Simply Bits with six cameras at our summer home and they work all the time and we\u2019ve had that service for three years. So this is definitely disappointing."

Technical support is only available from 8 to 5, in other words, during your working hours. Therefore when your Internet isn\u2019t working (which you don\u2019t notice until you are home after work) there is no one that can help you. If you call them during your lunch it\u2019s pointless because you need to be home to troubleshoot. There has not been a week in my last 4 months that my Internet doesn\u2019t go out. Worst part is that you get locked in to a contract. Honestly, all I want is to revoke that contract and just go back to cox. This service is absolutely pathetic and I will not stop putting this terrible service on blast on every community Facebook page until my contract is over. Ironically, as I am writing this review, I am without internet and using my cellphone hotspot. It\u2019s just terrible. Please, do yourself a favor and stay away from Simply Bits."

We have called over six times, and never gotten a call back. The internet is only working less than 20% of the time, and it flickers on and off which prevents any page from loading correctly or any zoom call from going through. It's a huge problem during this pandemic as work requires a consistent connection for an internet based program and frequent zoom style meetings so I am having to use my cell as a hotspot (and I am definitely not looking forward to getting that inflated phone bill.) At this point we'd be happy to increase our service plan and sign a new contract IF they would just give us a whole new set of equipment as if we were brand new customers, but we can't even get an answer on that. I don't know if covid is what has them all discombobulated, but I cannot afford to pay for both a \"non\"-internet plus a cell phone hotspot at a premium cost."

I could understand charging the fee if I just decided to cancel but I didn't I bought a new house and can't control where you service and don't!!! So I canceled and told them to bill me the cancellation fee as I just moved and didn't have the 200$ upfront nor was I going to pay for a service I wasn't using!!! So I was told I would be billed and to my surprise they automatically charged my credit card 100.00 I called them to find out how they did that and why and the card they had on file was expired... I never gave them my new information there billing department changed the expiration date until the card went through... talk about fraud I never authorized that payment!!!! Then I told them to not charge the other hundred dollars to call me so I can authorize the payment... guess what they never called they sent me an email saying they charged my account!!! Once again I never authorized the payments!! I was heartbroken to see this kind of business being done after the Internet service was so wonderful!!!"

          "Contenu": "The Good: service is reliable so far; getting speeds close to advertised (25/7 mbps). More upload bandwidth than the other WISP (Bluespan). Friendly install technician (Justin) wore a mask inside and did a clean professional job. No long-term contract or cancellation fee means it's low risk to try.The Bad: Simply Bits has chosen to put your router in jail behind carrier-level NAT with a private IP address that is not routable from the rest of the internet. This means that if you want to connect to devices on your home network from somewhere else (e.g. using VPN or port forwarding), you need to use some other workaround (like a Wireguard tunnel to a publicly routable server somewhere else). SB does not warn you of this, you only find out once you buy the service and see that your router gets a WAN IP address in private (RFC 1918) space. Yes, the world has only 4 billion public IPv4 addresses, but $100/month service should get you one of them, or at least a public IPv6 address. SB will sell you a public, static IP address for an extra $15/month on top of service that is already more expensive than the cable company. Nearly every other residential ISP (including Cox) gives you a dynamically-assigned public IPv4 address as part of their basic service offering, no extra charge.The Ugly: SB has outsourced their tech support to the lowest-bidding call center whose primary job is to prevent you from talking to anyone local who knows what they are doing. On day one, I called to ask for help diagnosing an ethernet duplex mismatch between SB's CPE radio and my own network gear. I had a simple request for SB: try manually setting the network port on their radio to full-duplex, let me test, then set back to auto-negotiate, and let me test again. To anyone who has dealt with computer networks for a living, this is a basic, easy request, but it greatly confused the outsourced CSR who was hesitant to escalate it. Among other chaff and flares, he told me it was after hours and I would need to call back tomorrow between 8 AM and 5 PM... at 3:08 PM, on a Monday! After being told to contact my network equipment vendor about 6 times, he finally transferred me to a local Simply Bits engineer, Cody, who immediately understood the request and helped me resolve it. I wish SB would just let me speak with someone like Cody when I need it. The outsourced tech support is unprofessional and insulting, especially for a local company that might ostensibly care about local customer support."

However, for some reason, the technicians came to our house at 8am!Very poor experience with the first steps of getting your service installed.

They then dinged me $25 fee for a declined payment when it's been only 20 days from my last payment. They then send me an email after the late charges are assessed and state they \"always invoice\" the 20th of every month. This only after I sent them an email asking why I was being charged twice.I gave 3 stars bc other than the shady billing practices I have no complaints on the performance of the internet thus far. Sadly, I really wanted to share a good review for this company but this issue can not be overlooked."

If I had access to cable or high speed internet through anyone else I wouldn't use Simplibits.  This doesn't mean that Simplibit isn't any good, it means they are okay with reasonable, but not great, speed.  I've found the service to be quite reliable in terms of lack of service interruptions.  I find throughput to be a bit lumpy at what is likely their prime time, as I'm a residential customer.  I also run voice through Simplibits without QOS.  The majority of the time voice quality is fine.  It is nice that someone actually answers and speaks to you when you call either their admin or service organizations."

He pointed out that my eero router/WiFi system only has one ethernet port (which he wasn't very happy about) but that the WiFi system is strong.  Overall I am happy with the system so far using only the WiFi for all my internet devices."

He was on-time, professional, and courteous. He made sure we were up and running before leaving. This would have been a \"5 star\" review, but I am paying for the ultimate plan (25 Mbps) and have not reached that speed yet. Before Austin left, he explained that the tower from where we are receiving the signal is pretty full. So, he had to put us on tier 2 instead of 1. That's totally fine and I completely understand; however, I am still paying for 25 Mbps. I'm hoping the speeds will improve over time, but if not I may have to switch to a lower plan. With the exception of the speed issue, Simply Bits has been great and our internet has never been faster even at the lower speed. We were only getting 3 Mbps through our former internet company, so  even 10 Mbps is a huge improvement for us and we certainly notice the difference."

          "Contenu": "Everyone I talked to was friendly and mostly helpful. The main problem was that after calling to arrange installation of my new service, the day for installation came and we were not on the schedule. It took me 4 tries to reach someone on the phone - I was disconnected 3 times - twice by the system transferring me to a number that rang and rang then just ended the call and once by someone transferring me to a wrong number. I'd say the phone system needs work. When I finally spoke to someone it took a bit because for some reason they thought our house was not in the service area, despite the fact that the previous owners had been using Simply Bits for years. And another thing - the previous owners, when they disconnected their service, both emailed and called Simply Bits to tell them to keep the equipment on site as the new owners (me) would be setting up service. Nope. they took the equipment anyway. (perhaps this is a policy - but seems odd - and maybe we ended up with newer equipment?  communication seems to be an issue). Renee, in sales, was able to work with the folks who do the installs to get us scheduled for install right away despite the fact that we somehow got dropped from their calendar. Brenden - the install tech - was friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient.  So far the service has been fine.  We are in a remote area so the speed is not the fastest, but told they should be upgrading the equipment in our area over the next year. I do hope this happens because my husband and I both work from home and often have to deal with large file transfers, so having faster speeds will be great."

After I navigated through a lengthy voice mail trail, a recorded voice told me that the office was closed and I should try my call again later. No mention of when \u201clater\u201d was. The voice mail said nothing about office hours.On Easter Monday, I called National Company again. Got a live human! Who transferred me to tech support!Which was overseas.Although I had difficulty understanding the lady, she reset my modem.As soon as I was back online, I went to the Simply Bits website and signed up for local service. What a difference. Unlike National Company, which sent a whole team of installers to my house, Simply Bits sent one guy who got the whole installation done in a couple of hours.Count me as a fan!"

The technician that came out was extremely kind friendly and helpful. He explained everything he was doing and was just a great help all together. So I\u2019ve only had this service for about a week and I have nothing bad to say about it at all. All positive. I work from home and do a lot of streaming and this Internet has worked perfectly! I will be recommending this Internet service to everybody up here in San Manuel! Thankyou Simply Bits!!!!"
