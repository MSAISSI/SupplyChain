          "Contenu": "At first it seemed like a decent company - but trying to draft a general email for responding to my customers became a nightmare.  All but one of my emails (this is the text-em-all side of the business) was rejected as spam by THEM - even though my customers reached out to me first and I was trying to respond to them all at once to save time.  That's all fine and I can accept that they do things a certain way, but on my 4th attempt to rewrite an email to fit their high standards - I received an email that I had cancelled my account. It was their way of parting ways with me after 2 hours.  They also kept my $90 dollars.  I had to dispute it with American Express to cover myself.  I clicked on an ad and ended up with them, but since then I've found better companies that are easier to deal with.  Don't waste your time or throw your money on them - It's amateur hour over there."

Some of the issues may been internal to our own network security but we find the service to be slow, inadequate for legacy browsers and incapable of negotiating through changes to DST/EST. We also have experienced issues with permanently removing ex-employees from broadcasts.  When we work with the Call-Em-All technical staff, they are pleasant and quick to respond to our inquiries but overall, we are dissatisfied with the changes to their network as a result of their enhancements."

My only comment is that I would love to be able to create messages WITHOUT the contacts attached and keep as a draft until I am ready to add them. As in, adding the contact list being the last thing besides payment. That way, I simply would need to add it and make any scheduling adjustments before it sends."

We haven\u2019t used the text message part yet but we plan to in the near future. The only draw back that we\u2019ve had with Call-em-all is that the church membership software that we have doesn\u2019t work on the app like it does on the website. However that may be an issue on our side because we\u2019re using a legacy version of our software. I highly recommend that you give call-em-all a try! I think that you\u2019ll be well pleased!"

Instead, if the character limit is exceeded, the system notifies author that long texts may be fragmented. Reducing characters eventually causes the warning to disappear, giving one the impression that the message will not be fragmented. However, many texts get fragmented without warning. This is very annoying. Bring back the real-time character counter. 2) When viewing Contacts, only 5 or 6 are visible in a panel at one time. Choosing the 10 or 25 option does not make contacts visible in panel without scrolling. I would like to be able to view 20-25 contacts in one screen. 3) Broadcast time selection defaults to Immediately, which is never the case for me. I fear that this could cause a broadcast to go out prematurely."

The integration with our church database reduce the overhead of managing groups since we create the groups in the database and connect directly to those groups from within call-em-all. One of the features that has proven valuable to us, is the graphical status display, where we can see who answered calls, which ones went to voice mail, and the ones that failed. Having the names of the recipients listed helps us keep our congregation information up-to-date. The next feature that is impressive, is seeing which phone numbers can receive text messages and which ones will not. Call-em-all relieve the headache of guessing and we can take advantage of text groups and call-only groups. The one feature we would like, and from recent communications, we understand will come fairly soon, is MMS messaging. Overall, we are having a good experience with call-em-all since we subscribed about two months ago."

About 90% of the people are called within 5-10 min.  I also like that we can pay as we go and we do not need to pay for a subscription to a service that we only need once in a while. We just buy more credits as we need them.I HIGHLY recommend Call-Em-All without any resrvation."
