I do not know how they do it!The platform that they are offering creators gives you so many different revenue streams. The team is constantly publishing new features not only on the web but iOS and Android apps as well. If you are on the fence on getting this service, I would encourage you to join their facebook group and view their roadmap/or feature list that they are actively working on."

Offer communities. Group and private chat. Email marketing. Upsells. The list goes on! EzyCourse is really one software to rule them all because it replaces so many other platforms you're using now.My only complaint is the website is extremely difficult to build if you're a beginner or even intermediate. Unfortunately, this might be an extra cost you have to incur."

And even the few exceptions are rapidly shrinking as the EzyCourse team adds to and develops the platform. As \"icing on the cake,\" they are less expensive than the others. One of their strengths is their support. I have asked questions, sought help with modifications that I did not know how to implement, and asked about processes I didn't understand because of my limited technical knowledge; the support staff are always quick and thorough in their response. They truly go above and beyond elevating this excellent resource into the superior range."

All-in-one multipurpose platform: courses, blog, communities, coming coaching feature, digital and physical products, appointments, chats, live translations and so on;2. Fast developing product - developers inform about new features every week or so;3. Very fast and friendly support - its one of most helpful side in every digital product;4.

Whether you are working through the website or browsing in the Facebook group, there is always access to a live support technician and the response speed is amazing (minutes rather than hours). I don't think they ever sleep!Even more importantly, they fix your issue. Every time. They go out of their way to help even when the issue is with a third party (Sadek took time out of what must have been his evening to help me understand how my Stripe account works). Big players take note: THIS is how you do customer support. I thoroughly recommend Ezycourse to anyone looking to set up their own LMS, particularly if you are new to it all."

For example, you can sell 200 licences to a school or university, with a pricing which reflects lower costs for the number of licences bought. These features are not easily found elsewhere."

          "Contenu": "Being from a 3rd world country, there aren't many international platforms that are exchange rate budget friendly for a new online business. Ezycourse is the exception to that.I found out about the platform through a Business Coaching Group I'm in, and I've loved the experience from the start.I even made the decision in a heartbeat a few weeks ago, to do away with my Wordpress website. The Ezycourse team is building me a new, personal branded website for a FRACTION of the cost of what the Wordpress Hosting & maintenance was incurring. I am so grateful I found them when I did.Features are so user-friendly and easy to navigate for a non-techy savvy person, and if I stumble and need something urgently, no matter how small the query is - the team are so quick to respond and feedback in the Facebook community. Having my website, offers, payment gateway, launch funnels, campaigns all automated is a GAME CHANGER for my business. I am super excited to see how the new website comes out in a few weeks and I know my clients and students are going to have a seamless experience."

All the signs are that, unlike other LTDs, this should last long after the launch.Their reinvestment of funds in important areas shows their commitment to continuous improvement and providing users with the best possible experience for a long-term win-win business vision.And the 5% commission for each sale, which I didn't want before.It's OK with me now as long as it allows for good mutual development.I'm particularly excited about the editing options, such as CSS updates, which give users creative freedom when it comes to customising the website and branding or my products on the platform.And for those who want to set up their own LMS platform development agency, it's possible with Ezycourse. It's rare and cheap until the end of this month...However, like any LTD platform, there are always areas for improvements.I'm waiting to see the integration of the SCORM standard, which is essential for the training departments of the large companies I work with. And a better ability to translate the entire interface into French.All in all, given the confidence already gained by so many users, Ezycourse is definitely worth a look for anyone looking for an LMS + Community + Sales platform that keeps its promises.I've decided to change my platform this summer, and I'm switching to Ezycourse.It's a difficult decision because it involves a lot of work, but I'm going to reap the benefits from 2023 onwards."
