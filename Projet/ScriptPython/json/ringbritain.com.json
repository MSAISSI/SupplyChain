Despite polite and prompt responses (an email chain of 7 emails) from RingBritain customer support they were unable to work with my telco provider (Fido in Canada) to apply the credit amount.  I also spoke with Fido who had no knowledge of RingBritain and therefore could not help.  Unfortunately RingBritain are not willing to refund my credit card payment made to them either."

I was calling a number in England and I was using the correct codes.  It is about the only number I call and know for a fact that I dialed correctly.

Your reply and caring about your customers in such a way deserves 10 stars. RingBritain is great when using from my mobile, and I certainly have no complaints on that front.  However, when using the landline I am no longer able to make any connections to Britain. Do not know what is going on there as initially I could use both.  The website is user friendly, it is easy to access my account and to make changes and add more time etc.  The cost is really fantastic for contacting with all the family and friends back in Britain that are not yet on the internet. Thank you RingBritain."
