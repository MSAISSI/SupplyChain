I'm not sure if there is another way to do that, but it's difficult pulling donors or stakeholders, sorting them, and realizing they have a paragraph worth of flags. I am participating in training next week with my organization. I hope these items become more evident."

Our organization is constantly evolving and we need a system that can evolve with us. If we are not able to look into additional and affordable options for DonorPerfect and other integrated services we would consider looking into other donor management platforms."

Just add an extra line for an organization and check that box if you want.  For small communities like ours, most businesses are mom and pops so sorting alphabetically by name (owner) would be better in some cases.I know we aren't using it to its capacity because the learning curve is always bigger than one thinks and we have limited staff time to do this."

The constant updates, surveys asking for feedback, and resources to help with all sorts of things (Giving Tuesday, coronavirus, etc.) are so helpful to me and my organization. This score is really more of a 4.5, but I can't give a full 5 stars because there are some things that I'm not a huge fan of, namely some of the updates to reports we use all the time. This is partially due to my dislike of change, but I think it would be nice to keep a Classic or Traditional version of often-used reports for those of us who are having issues with the new versions. For example, the new Daily Log report has been a huge problem for me and all the Excel spreadsheets I've created with this report since it was updated have errors on them. I don't know how to fix the problem and others who also use the reports I run for them have issues, too. It's not a HUGE deal, but it would just be nice to have the option to not always use the updated versions of things. But overall, we are very pleased with DonorPerfect!!"

          "Contenu": "My organization had used another CRM for many years, since the late 1980s without ever updating or upgrading it. It had been state-of-the-art when we first acquired it but, as is true of some legacy software created by a large company, it was so outdated that no one used it anymore. And the annual fee had become quite expensive.As a result, we looked at more than a dozen fundraising platforms and demoed at least six different ones, including a cloud-based version of the CRM we had at the time. We chose DonorPerfect because of the simplicity of the interface and ease of use, both in inputting new information and retrieving data on reports. DP offers easy to understand on-demand videos for every aspect of its use. It also has expert facilitators for live videos and trainers providing clear, detailed instructions for organization-specific sessions. For the latter training workshops, you are provided with a video of the session and a detailed write-up of instructions. This reinforces learning for attendees and provides tailored training for the rest of team who were unable to attend.While the migration process was initially bumpy, DP assigned a dedicated staffer to work with us at no extra charge to make sure we were happy with the final result.My organization has found DP to be a good platform to allow programs to improve and create effective multichannel fundraising campaigns."

In recent years, DP has become increasingly responsive to suggestions for updates from the users.  DP integrates with popular add-ons like Constant Contact reducing the amount of data entry.  And fund raisers can track their contacts and stay on task with Moves Management and calendar integration.  Reporting is far simpler than many other platforms."

I can see at a glance how many donors we've retained, how many lapsed donors have returned, how many new donors we have, how many gave two or more gifts last year -- and because I can pull up all their names, I plan to send a mid-year thank you note.I can't manage the ledger yet. My staff can do that, and I see regular reports, but I'm thinking about how to segment my donors. I want to browse a bit. But I won't really be ready to segment donors for another six months or more. I have time to learn.And I have six hours of one-on-one tutoring still to use. The first two-hour session was excellent."

          "Contenu": "DonorPerfect Online is a great donor database/customer relationship management platform. As a small nonprofit on a very tight budget, finding a software solution that can handle all of our needs while still being budget-friendly is a must. DonorPerfect allows us to keep track of our donors and their gifts, do monthly payroll giving imports for mass gifts on a bi-monthly basis, create custom giving pages for specific funds/needs/campaigns, and has a lot of add on features. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars, is because many of the add on features cost additional money (text to give, ConstantContact integration, ReadSetAuction, etc. all great add ons, but most small nonprofits can't afford the additional expenses, so will either find a more cumbersome but cheaper method, or just forgo the expense). All in all, it's a great system with excellent customer service via chat or by phone (available 5:30am - 5:00 pm PST) that can help with onboarding and questions at every turn. Custom reporting makes it easy to do GL exports for accounting, board reports, annual reports, event reports, or nearly any report you can think of. Mailing/contact lists are easy to generate, and the ability to add custom flags allows you to easily segment your donors by whatever catagory you prefer (great for college foundations who want to track alumni, employee, trustee, board, or local business giving!)"

The knowledge base also covers everything I've had questions on.Cons: Minor bugs, but those get fixed just shortly after I notice them. If I were to nitpick I could say some things could be more aesthetically pleasing.Overall: The overall experience has been incredibly positive. I am not quite sure how we would keep track of our donations had it not been for DP. Favorite part is definitely the support team, least favorite is that sometimes the receipting can get confusing."
