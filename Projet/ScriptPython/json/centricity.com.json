And the 5 year extended warranty WHICH IS A WASTE. No one cares, they just keep ignoring me saying they are working on getting parts, oh they have to work an approval, OH this or that, but I have no oven for the holidays, and that is the worst of all of this, THEY JUST DO NOT CARE ONCE THEY HAVE THE CONSUMERS MONEY IN POCKET. DO NOT TAKE ANY EXTENDED WARRANTY AND DO NOT BUY ANY WHIRLPOOL PRODUCTS PERIOD."

I have confirmed GE has the parts but apparently they are not ordering from GE. Cannot get this escalated despite almost weekly calls to them.Worthless warranty sold by Airport Appliance - no recourse.UPDATE 12/17/2023 After posting this and one on TrustPilot I finally got a calland Epic(Centricity) has offered a credit without tax covered and under the current price of the unit so we will need add about $722.48 to get a new oven. Note on message said: Customer Responsible for Delivery/Part/Haulaway.... E. at Airport Appliance is referenced with a phone number but no responses despite leaving messages. Went into the Emeryville Store today and now waiting 2 -3 weeks \"of course the holidays might mean longer\" to get clarification on taxes and conditions of a refund... as we will not pay more for the replacement under warranty."

I\u2019ve been without a dishwasher for 2 months now. The call center reps are nice but they can\u2019t do anything. They also always say they will call me back and never do. I think Centricity does this in hopes you will just give up and buy a new appliance; I don\u2019t think they ever plan to complete my claim."

          "Contenu": "Centricity contacted the appliance store where I bought my Asko dishwasher and told them that were discontinuing my service contract and giving me store credit. My contract is due to expire 12/17/2025. This is just not right. The reason they are giving is that it is not possible to service the dishwasher so that it functions normally. Asko put out a service bulletin just 2 weeks after my second to last service call with multiple parts that should be replaced. My understanding is that the appliance store, Bekins of Grand Haven MI, would order those parts and install them. However Bekins called me to say that a store credit was being issued and that the warranty was cancelled. The contract identifies three reasons for cancelling a contract. None of these reasons applies to my situation. Centricity has made a unilateral decision basically cancelling my contract."

It's now been 11 days and they say a supervisor will call me back with in 24-48 business hours. Cell phone is broke and if I repair without the authorization, that may void the coverage. Horrible, horrible customer service. Don't work with these guys. Also looks like they acquired Upsie, so don't buy from them either. Bait and switch and don't stand behind their services."

Since then they have sent two companies on nine (yes 9) repair visits to our home with no success.  That's six months with no fridge!  The last repair company said the fridge is NOT repairable, which at this point means the warrantee company must replace it per the contract.  So far zero!  This is the worst company we have ever worked with by far.  They continue to delay doing what the contract calls for to avoid paying for a new fridge.  Avoid this company like the plague! From our experience it's hard to imagine all of these 5 star reviews could be real."

The first repair company could not repair it so Epic sent a second repair company..After numerous attempts and replacements of many many parts the second repair company told Epic that the refrigerator is not repairable.  That is all the company requires to replace or send money for a replacement refrigerator.  We still do not have a decision to replace the fridge.  What gives?  It feels like they are just waiting for us to give up and buy a new one and let them off the hook.  We aren't going to do that but we are going to write these reports about the company."

There have been multiple attempts to fix my dishwasher and no resolution.  Whenever a service appointment is scheduled, I must take a day off from work.  The appointment window time is between 8 AM and 5 PM. Two of the 4 times service techs have shown up, it was past 5 PM.  On one of the occasions, the tech showed up at 7:45 PM and my dishwasher was disassembled in my kitchen until 9:30 PM. In addition, of the 5 service appointments I have had, one of them was a \"no show\" and I even received a text that \"the tech was on their way.\" After waiting all day for the tech and finally calling Centricity at the end of the day to find out why the tech had not shown up after receiving a message that they were on their way, I was told the appointment had been canceled and no reason was given.  The last time a tech showed up, I was told that the dishwasher could not be fixed as it was not cost-effective at this point as there had already been multiple parts ordered and installed already.  I was told by the tech that Centricity should be reaching out to follow up after the appointment. I received no follow-up call. I called Centricity several days later and was told the case was at the claims department level and they would call me after making a decision: still no call.  I called again after this and was told that parts had been ordered again.  I found out this was not true after I called their subcontractor (A & E Factory Appliance) and was told that no parts had been ordered and that the case had been closed. I called AGAIN and told them what A & E told me and they told me that A & E was wrong.  I even emailed the documentation to Centricity to support this information. I have spoken to Hector on more than two occasions and he is condescending and does not appear to be forthcoming. Centricity has serious leadership issues and unethical business practices."

It\u2019s been 5 business days and no follow up. I called back and a customer service rep said they are \u201cescalating the escalation\u201d \u2026 oh boy!! The customer service person said they have no direct access to speak to their claims people. So they literally have to email a general claims mailbox to ask for updates for a customer. What a joke. I feel bad for their CSRs. They have no tools or access to actually provide customer service. Can I update this to 0 stars? Purchased an extended warranty on appliances. One of my appliances malfunctioned in July 2022. Several attempts were made by an authorized service provider (ASP) to replace various parts, but it still is not operable. A second ASP was asked to come in and give a second opinion. They made a diagnosis and parts were put on order. 3 months later (now March, 2023 - 8 months after the initial claim was filed), there is no ETA for the parts associated with this diagnosis. A Centricity rep informed me that if a diagnosis is confirmed and no ETA can be provided for the associated parts within 10 business days, they would offer an alternate solution (i.e. a credit/ replacement). It has been 3 months and there is no update. I have called at least 5 times and been told that this will be escalated and I will hear back in a few business days and nobody ever calls back. Weeks go by, I call back again, there are no updates, etc... The customer service is some of the worst I've ever seen. They tell you they will escalate something and never follow up. You call back and the rep checks the notes and there's no record of somebody escalating anything, which makes it seem like their reps are just saying something to get the customer off the phone. There is no actual intention to try and take care of the customer. When I've asked to be transferred to a supervisor/ management to speak to, they say, \"I can't do that...\" ... I would never buy a warranty through Centricity again."

The Voice message states to go to the website to schedule service. Well, I have no work order number to schedule. I could not get anyone to talk when I called A and E. I reached out to the location of Grand Appliance They gave me the same number I had called. Then I was given another number for Centricity the warranty company. After 5 calls (Now Feb 1) I am told the parts were not ordered. They will expedite the order. At this time The voicemail I got was because 1 part was in. On Feb 2 the representative got irate with me because I asked him\"how am I going to wash clothes for a family of 5 if your company is not doing what they are responsible for?\" He told me he does want to hear my semantics. This rude representative told me when I call A and E I have to act like I am a repairman. On Feb 4 a part arrived at my home. I called A and E on Feb 6 and was told that I have the only part. The other part is on Back Order. On Feb 2 I spoke to Grand Appliance customer service and they state they have no control. They could call on my behavior if I liked. A complete disappointment for all companies involved. Today is Feb 11 and still no washer to wash our clothes. On top of this, NO ONE is following up with me. There is no compensation except for the $50 that I spend on washing. In order for that to happen, the part needs to be repaired, and I have to submit receipts for a laundry mate. I have never had receipts from a laundry mate before."

That alone takes about 20 minutes on each and every call.CENTRICITY is charging me, not a third party, therefore they have to have some control over this!When I was given a URL, but it did not work or have an active site on it.It seems to me like they want iConnect monthly customers (formerly a Sears program) to go away!Dave Humphry told me to call the company that I bought the warranty from but since it was from Sears (Emily confirmed) on 8/13 that it was Sears and also saw Ian\u2019s correspondence from 1998), through Iconnect, but that was not possible. They` sold all accounts to Centricity/Bankers Warranty Group, Inc.I now have to wait for a supervisor to call me back AGAIN to get this straightened out. Fourth attempt. That was many weeks ago. Now it has been two MORE weeks since my last contact.I repeatedly called Dave Humphry\u2019s extension and there no answer and no voicemail.I spoke with Dave on 9/9/22Spoke with Trinity on 10/5/22 at 4 PM. She Trying to reach Dave - sent a message that I want to speak with him. NO CALL.Dave Humphry promised me that he would stay on top of this until he got an answer! He was going on vacation for 2 weeks but would definitely take care of this for me\u2026 Yet another promise was broken.I KNOW that you are better than this and only need the right person to know what to do. I have not found them yet!This SHOULD be simple as with every other company out there!I just want to pay my bill, as usualBen"

Being frazzled with my computer not booting and needing a new Logic Board, I didn't realize it was Friday past 3pm EST when I sent my initial request into Centricity from an iPhone that was rapidly losing charge :( Thankfully the attachment made it! My request was replied to on Wednesday (so within 3 business days) via a very cordial email. Looking back at my files and exchanged correspondence: 1) Centricity was extremely responsive in terms of providing a choice of whether to mail-in my computer for repair (they sent a box and everything) or to recommend a shop within the vicinity (I chose this option as it was deemed to be more expedient).2) They were communicative in terms of when they were in receipt of my request.3) Kept me updated with timing in terms of reimbursement.4) They offered option of payment for reimbursement via either a check or Zelle. At the time, Zelle was a new partner for them; the process was extremely fast without any delays.5) As an aside, I am grateful for the referral to Centricity/Upsie's recommended SVC, Allstates. I have nothing but wonderful superlatives for proprietor Mr. John Hunter. His perspicacious testing (and re-testing) to confirm the issue put me at ease.I wholeheartedly recommend Centricity for their professionalism, responsiveness, and timeliness. In all I was without my computer for maybe a week (considering the wait for parts) and reimbursement took around 45 days."
