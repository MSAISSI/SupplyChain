I'm not a fan of live chat, but I thought it was the most wisest remedy. Although it was thrown out there as an option, it evidently doesn't exist. Minutes will be added momentarily does not mean sometime within the next four hours. Why can your system not accommodate a more expeditious addition of service? AND then, I received no text informing me of minutes added and my end of service date. Why?"

Sometimes there is some code that is also required to activate the account. That code is not shown unless one digs around for it as for why the phone is not working.   Past minutes are not carried over to new refills either.    This is a poor way to conduct business."

We both added one or more 3-month service options so our service time would end at the same time (so we could remember it better).  Seems the service time we had previously paid for was lost, all we ended up with just the 3 months.  Service time ended months early and all our phones were useless, we couldn't even transfer our phone numbers to new phones. Emails asking for a refund for the time we lost were ignored.  WE WERE RIPPED OFF  New owners of Tracfone raised the prices, but we would have been better off just paying more through their website."

In the GO-Phone Section description of the $2/day plan, there was no obvious place to order the card or number of minutes I wished. When I talked to your customer service person, she directed me to another place which mentioned two other plans, but not the $2 per day plan. That either has to be added there or on the $2 per day/25 cents/min there needs to be a clear direction for where to place the order.Your customer service people have ALWAYS been wonderfully helpful. Congratulations!Fix the website items and you get 5 stars."
