Ordered parts for a small prototype run (~$500usd) due to Mouser having stock that my normal suppliers didn't. Proceeded to spend two weeks of back and forth over the phone having order after order cancelled (with no follow up at all) due to completely opaque reason. Eventually settled on wire transfer to \"verify\" the company. Spend 3 days waiting for information on customs. Eventually had to change the shipping address and then had them ship the order without indicating I would need to provide self-brokerage (adding additional cost you typically never need with electronics firms). No remorse whatsoever from anyone I spoke with. Could not imagine placing a larger order with them."

I will never do business with them again and I really recommend no one else building a small business do so either. They could at least ask what you're doing.....before cutting off critical supplies as your tiny business grows. Basically they are just forcing you to just get them cheaper from overseas and sending money outside the American economy."

          "Titre": "Beware: Broken payments and awful customer support",
          "Contenu": "My hope is that this review serves as a warning for any potential customers thinking of ordering from Mouser. If you have any type of issue whatsoever with your order you will instantly regret it as soon as you have to interact with their customer service.The saga unfolded as follows:1. Following an order on their website, I received an immediate request to complete the End-User Certification form.2. Despite promptly submitting the form, there was an inexplicable month-long silence, prompting my inquiry into the status of my order.3. A delayed response indicated the need for more specific information on my form, leading to a revised submission, eventual order release, and a tracking number.4. Mouser then fails to charge my credit card, which results in a post-shipment refund.5. I then get an email from Accounts Representative (AA#1). The correspondence with AA#1 included baseless accusations of a \"chargeback,\" requiring a protracted seven-email exchange for an acknowledgment that the error was made by them.6. I informed AA#1 that I had already entered my credit card details into my Mouser Account, but apparently they are not able to charge those cards? AA#1 instead directed me to a separate, seemingly unaffiliated and non-functional website for credit card details submission, and then stopped responding when I informed them that the site does not work.7. After a few days I get a new email from completely different Accounts Representative (AA#2) that displayed a concerning lack of awareness having no knowledge of my correspondence with AA#1 which necessitated the manual transmission of the entire email thread to avoid having to start the whole thing over again.8. AA#2 then sends me a receipt for my order and ask me to send them a wire transfer, and then completely ignores me when I tell them that the receipt does not actually contain any payment information or instructions whatsoever.9. I finally manage to perform a wire-transfer, which my bank charged 6% of the total price for, erasing any price advantage Mouser might have had. Not to mention the stress and time lost of having to deal with their abysmal custom support.But honestly, the worst part has to be the almost complete lack of remorse or good will for the avoidable challenges stemming completely from Mouser's unwarranted refund initiation. Especially from AA#2."

I was forced to spend another $1,000 with Tektronix to acquire the license, which comes with a digital probe. Now I\u2019ve got two probes, one of which I\u2019m not permitted to return to Mouser because the bag has been opened (your customer support person suggested I open it to find the missing license).You sell the probe without a license, when it doesn\u2019t work (because you did let the buyer know a license was required) you\u2019ve just cost your client over $1,000 for something you Know he won\u2019t be able to use.

You used to get a one person customer service who made responsible for any issues related to your purchase. Now your order can fall in the \u201cexport review\u201d process for weeks without getting any updates or estimated shipping date. In case you get an answer or customer service emails they\u00b4re signed by \u201cCustomer Service Representative\u201d, so you cannot make sure someone is making responsible for the follow up. They keep asking for the same information you already provided. If your order is international, the US representatives ignore it and, if you persist, they refer your case (without giving an answer to you) to your country\u00b4s representative, who has no idea about your actual situation and assume your order is going to be exported even if it is not. It is really frustrating. I understand they have their own policies and must have a lot of work due to COVID and chip shortages, but they waste more time by being inefficient in their customer service."

          "Contenu": "Es werden dringend Ersatzteile von Infineon ben\u00f6tigt, die in ausreichender St\u00fcckzahl auf Lager sind (Wert ca. 500,00\u20ac). Bei Mouser geht niemand ans Telefon, den ganzen Tag am 08.04.2022 nicht, es ruft auch niemand zur\u00fcck. Also bleibt nur online-Bestellung. Ware bezahlt und f\u00fcr Dienstag, 12.04.2022 best\u00e4tigt bekommen.Die Ware ist bis Samstag, 16.04.2022 nicht geliefert, Mouser wollte eine aktuelle Best\u00e4tigung nun versenden, auch dieses war eine leere Zusage. Man h\u00e4tte in der Woche vor dem Bestelltag Streiks gehabt, also h\u00e4tte ich die Ware auch \u00fcber den Wettbewerb i England beziehen k\u00f6nnen, was normal 2 Tage l\u00e4nger dauert, also jetzt l\u00e4ngst erledigt w\u00e4re.Am Telefon dieses Mal jemand erreicht, aber eine sehr unwillige Dame ohne Verst\u00e4ndnis f\u00fcr die \u00e4rgerliche Situation.Mouser sitzt Probleme auf Kosten der Kunden aus, informiert nicht, ist nicht erreichbar, ruft nicht zur\u00fcck, sendet trotz Zusage keine Infos - man steht im Regen.Sendung k\u00f6nnte nun am Dienstag, also eine Woche sp\u00e4ter eintreffen als zugesagt, oder auch wieder nicht. Fazit: wer Ware wirklich ben\u00f6tigt, darf hier nichts ordern. Vorkasse ist geleistet, Lieferung oder gar Auskunft dar\u00fcber = Fehlanzeige, auch auf Verlangen keinerlei Unterst\u00fctzung. Nie wieder Mouser Deutschland.Urgent spare parts needed, moduls from Infineon, on stock at Mouser (system information).Friday morning 8th April no one at telephone, no reaction to urgent recall at answering machine. So online order placed and payed in advance (500,00\u20ac). Delivery time given by the system is Tuesday 12th April = o.k.Nothing arrived up today (Saturday 16th April), delayed delivery might arrive on Tuesday 19th April or later.Asked for further information on phone on 14th April (day before holiday) (very long time to wait for service, 1x hanged up by the mouser system). Unpolite and not really interested female assistant on phone, given information: some days before I placed the order has been a strike in another European country, that might cause delays, but no info given to the system. So I did not order the goods at a competitor, who has had the units on its British stock, because of 2 days longer delivery time, but meanwhile it would have been far in advance! The promises email about an update about estimated delivery time or situation has never been sent to me. Conclusion: if you really need some parts, do not order them at Mouser. No replies on phone calls, no or bad service, no responsibilities. Cocksure of oneself staff instead.So never again Mouser Germany (Munich)"

I notice they were marketing North American rated product (120V/60Hz) product in Germany (220V/50Hz). No reply to electronic returns request. Calls to local customer service dropped upon transfer to person without any interaction. Chat function gets India in out of local office hours, very friendly, but can\u2019t help in this case. In office hours could get transferred to local chat team, but unfriendly and unable to help. Escalate feature on website resulted in a bounced mail, e-mail address at Mouser no longer valid! Guess I have to drive to Munich, lucky for me just 50km away. Seems I have a destination to aim for as soon as I clear isolation"

I'm not sure that cutting off the means to do that by limiting orders to 1000pcs of a line is the best way forward. When all of this mess with Chipageddon finally gets sorted out, customers will remember the businesses who helped them out and no longer show any loyalty to those who didn't.

There was no call or email letting us know the items wouldn't ship on time.  \r If Mouser is unable to fulfill shipments that are made before the 8pm deadline, maybe the deadline should be moved to an earlier time? When Mouser is unable to keep their deadlines, it puts us in a position where we are unable to keep promises to our clients which costs our reputation and hurts our bottom line.  \r We will be going back to Digikey for time sensitive orders as over the past 13 years they have only failed to make the deadline once.  They called us to let us know there was an issue shipping out the package and worked out a shipping solution that arrived the next day using courier service."

          "Contenu": "I've been ordering from Mouser for almost 15 years now and they are a great company with fast service but there new web ordering page is horrible. The navigation is awful. You are forced to  scroll endlessly. Also, after you order a part when you click on continue shopping, it kicks you out of the menu options you were in from the last part you ordered. You then have to start over.  This is very annoying, especially when you are ordering several parts in the same category. Your old website ordering was much better. All options were laid out from left to right. Now it takes me twice as much time to order the same items.  I order at least once a week from Mouser. You are my number one supplier but I've been using digikey and Newark more and more now because of your website. Please put it back the way it was. Please!!!!! Thanks for your time. Best regards, Steve Veilleux /SVT Audio LLC"

I called after the order was placed to confirm that it would get shipped out that day (since the items were in stock) so that I would receive the next.  I was told they ship out all the way until 8 pm and seeing as how it wasn't even noon it would go out.  I get a phone call today, the day that I am supposed to receive the items, stating that it didn't ship until today with no real explanation other than the warehouse may not have gotten to all the orders.  In my opinion if someone pays for overnight shipping and the product is available, then that order should be processed and sent out the day it was placed.  Yes, I was told I would receive a credit for the shipping but it doesn't change the fact that I don't have the items that I needed on the day I needed them."

For these two boards we paid around Rs 2400 as customs duty and we informed they we wont pay another customs duty for replacement. Support without any knowledge said ok ok for all our concerns raised. But finally when the replacement board came customs again charged around Rs. 2600 again for which we fought to DHL and Mouser. None responded and we indrectly forced to pay and release the package from Customs. Finally when we received the replaced we again found the jumper was broken. When raised the concern to mouser their support initally said the person who handled the issue was on leave etc. and finally spoke to a gentlemen. He said if i want replacement i need to capture a picture of two broken boards keept side by side as proof. Thing is one the first time itself we striggle and proved the board was damaged with photos and showed proof that the time we received the courier and time we raised the concern etc. My great anger and displeasure is for Rs. 1662 board they made to to pay Rs. 5000 as customs and still we have got one undamged board. Mouser rocks how to frustrate customer and get out trouble."

I've never been so frustrated with an online shopping cart system before this experience.  \r The entire website loads its pages as if it I were on a dial up connection in the late 90s.  To ensure it wasn't my 4 year old MBP running slow, I opened another tab to see if Google was loading slowly, and sure enough it was just the Mouser site.  I use this laptop everyday for audio recording/video editing and it does those jobs quite well with no noticeable slowdown of performance.\r After about an hour of trying to use the search function and narrowing the scope of my search, I realized that despite directly typing mouser.com into my browser, I hadn't even been on the full site.  I wan't on the mobile site either (at least I'm hoping it wasn't the mobile site, because that would be a terrible way to navigate the site on an iPhone or iPad).  After clicking the view full site button, my experience was marginally better until I kept getting messages trying to confirm I wasn't a robot, because apparently I was clicking through the website too fast.\r Had Mouser not had all the parts I needed, which I was unable to get elsewhere, I'd have made my purchase somewhere else.  \r I'm not the type of person who enjoys writing bad reviews...in fact, I regularly become a raving fan of any company that exceeds my expectations.  I'd love to see my experience somehow salvaged.  The ball is in your court to redeem my shopping experience.\r Thanks,\rDerek Studt"

Two of the main issues I find with the site is pictures of products are not accurate, up to date, or sometimes just missing. Having accurate pictures of the product can go a long way in helping customers to identify the correct part for ordering. The second main issue is that on connector product pages, there should be links to other items used with the connector, such as terminals and seals. This would make it much more simple for the customer to find the terminals and seals for the desired connector. I end up ordering a lot of parts from other companies because sometimes it is too difficult, or takes too long, to find all of the supplemental parts needed with a connector."

For example, Today's order was for relays I was forced to purchase elsewhere because they are not even in your catalog.Additionally, the price was almost 25% higher here than there for one of the other products which I purchased.However, the item I DID purchase here, was well priced and I like the low MOQ.Something that would be VERY beneficial as a customer is if you had a HIGHLIGHTED button that presented ALL available alternative components for a given item... that I do not have to go hunting for. This is EXTREMELY important for End of Life items. Not only would it save me time trying to track down those alternatives, it would make it easy for customers to find that product and thereby increase your sales."

I had to repeat my registration and finally got through. Thankfully, my order specifications were saved and after registration, I continued to place my order. Second, I tried to print my order after completion of the process using the \"Print Order\" link at the top of the invoice. It opened another window and printed out my order WITHOUT the complete totals that included the shipping and tax. I used a feature on my computer to get a complete invoice printout.I look forward to your emails and to shop for components on your site from time to time. Thanks.  John"

Sometimes they ship out that day and sometimes they don't.  You are claiming same day shipping, but it only happens about 10% of the time. Last year my orders ALWAYS showed up the next day (San Antonio). Now, they always show up 2 days later. You guys are great and have lots of stuff in stock. But getting stuff the next day with ground shipping makes you guys my first goto for parts. Now that's not happening anymore. Your thoughts? Will the shipping thing get fixed anytime soon?  If this is a COVID thing, why don't you change your shipping claim accordingly?  The little time ticker at the top of your site says, \"Order in next xx:xx hours to ship today\".  If you changed it to \"Until this COVID thing clears up, we are trying to ship same day, but most orders will at least go out next day\", that would be much more clear!  Thanks!  Keep up the good work.  I am thankful you guys are in Texas!"

          "Contenu": "It's easy enough to find parts and complete orders. My gripe is that there are many items that Mouser finds taxable as they're being shipped to California. When we place an order and are told one line will have tax added (on an line we're reselling), I call Mouser and am told they can't do anything about it, BUT, when we're billed we can call their tax department to have it reversed. We shouldn't have to jump through this hoop!  It slows down ordering, makes problems for our accounting department. Mouser also probably loses sales over it. Granted, Mouser sells lots of items that that companies or individuals may purchase for personal use and say they're for resale, and I imagine Mouser may have been tested, or audited by CA to make sure they're collecting CA sales tax.I think CA is not the only state that collects sales tax from out of state sellers. How does/should a customer notify Mouser if part of a purchase is taxable? Mouser should add a tick box (or some such) to the shopping cart for items that customers could say they should pay tax on that line item. We have a Resale Cert, and it's on file with Mouser. Up until recently were never asked if all or part of an order was for resale. Mouser just assumed it was."

The ability to order small quantity prototype quantities for hobbiest and repair markets is a huge service that I really appreciate.   The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the search engine continues to be a problem.  DigiKey has a better search engine, but you know that. My son went into electrical engineering, perhaps in part due to the magic of being able to order smal parts to use to repair cosumer electronics, that I have done from time to time.

Shipping has always been same day (unless I ordered on a Friday which understandably is not picked and shipped til Monday or Tuesday, I forget which). I've literally watched (through their website) an order be picked and prepared for shipment. Quite impressive how efficient they are. I also thought one of my orders was misdelivered because UPS said it was delivered yet it was not at my doorstep. I called them up and they were going to ship me out another one on them. Turns out, UPS guy marked it as delivered to avoid cut off time. He showed up to my home about an hour or so later with the package. I immediately called Mouser and told them what happened, and to cancel the replacement order. They did without difficulty. Man, this company is excellent. I just love ordering from them."

I know there are other, niche market suppliers but I rely on Mouser to get the most for my investments as well as my customer's.  I'm very happy with the selection of available, through-hole and axial lead parts.  Point-to-Point wiring is an artform and thus isn't suited for SMD where long leads and basic aesthetics are important to me and my customers.  Many desire as-close-to-original as can be obtained with modern components without restuffing capacitor cans and Bumble Bee casings.  Mouser is my go-to source for vintage components and I hope they continue supporting the vintage and antiques market."

One part of that order [16v 100uF] had a high ESR and intended to order all parts as low ESR. I noticed on the shipping invoice that two parts of the order were low \"impedance\" [ESR] and the one was \"general purpose\" electrolytic capacitors. This is likely due to confusion in the order sheet parts selection platform. [I thought I was selecting low ESR parts on ALL the parts.]I found the parts today in their lists from a different manufacturer [Panasonic, I previously ordered Rubycon] in confirmed low ESR. I was hoping that to solve the problem they would at least forgo the shipping cost on this new order to get the right parts. $7.99 shipping for a small blister pack of components across a couple of states seems quite exorbitant. To have to pay that cost again to get the right parts is extremely disappointing."
