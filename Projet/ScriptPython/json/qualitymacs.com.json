Both iMacs look and function like brand-new and shipped with the latest macOS when I received them. The first iMac which is now 12 years old still runs like a top even after extensive business and personal use, and the included HDD, SSD and internal DVD drives as shipped are still functioning fine. I believe because Macintosh hardware in general is built to last, and that Quality Macs sells well-inspected exceptional Macs, buying a Mac from Quality Macs that is 2 to 5 years old is a great way to get a lot of bang for your computer buck. Knowledgeable responses to questions and quick shipping, too. Highly recommended!"

They went out of the way to give me specific information in a very quick response that temporarily made me reconsider selling mine.  So they really offered me alternative options that didn't benefit them financially.  They won me as a customer for future purchases and trades.  This is so hard to find when most companies just want to get your money.  Please consider supporting this company.  I just can't tell you how impressed I am!"

          "Contenu": "I recently bought a used 2015 MacBook Pro 13\u201d (early 2015) model from QualityMacs back at the start of 2020. The laptop itself has a few minor scratches on the outside case and some dings but overall is everything they describe their products to be. For a 5 year old computer, it\u2019s in killer shape and runs like its brand new. My computer stopped working about a month ago, but they went above and beyond to help me resolve the issue. The owner, Jeff, and the rest of the QualityMacs team has worked with me personally to give me the best quality products and service for a great deal. I have a working laptop now within a week of working with them. If you\u2019re in the market for a used or even new Apple product, I would highly recommend buying from this company. Used computers, like anything used, do come with inherent risk though. They have very qualified (Apple certified) technicians to oversee each product, but over time minor errors can lead to bigger issues so consider buying their warranty so you don\u2019t have to stress if this were to happen to you. It\u2019s a fair price in my opinion.Lastly, buying any expensive product online is risky, but I assure you, they care a heck of a lot and deliver on their promises. I was skeptical when I first bought my used MacBook Pro since $640 seemed like too great of a deal for an Apple computer, but it\u2019s been worth it and am planning on purchasing an iMac from them in the coming months."
