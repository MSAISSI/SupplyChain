The customer service representative, Jason, couldn't provide a clear timeline for my refund and falsely assured me it would be processed right away. It's been a week since the cancellation, and I still haven't received my money. This has been a truly horrible experience, and I cannot recommend this company to anyone. Avoid at all costs!"

I bought an RGB LED strip, controller, and power supply. The controller was defective \u2014 worked for about a day, then got hot to the touch, started emitting a smell of burned plastic, and stopped responding to the remote. I suspect a short circuit, but either way, it's toast (literally.) As for the LED strip, it outlasted the controller, but one LED is already partially burnt out \u2014 only lights up red \u2014 so I have my doubts about how long it'll last overall."

After having the right means to put up the lights the sticky side of the lights is absolutely terrible it fell down 6 times before I had to go out and buy command strips to keep it from falling down. I really wish that was all the bad things but then the reciever that you point the remote at to change the colors almost never works it takes me to press the button 8 maybe 9 times before the lights even react and change to the correct color. I thought I was buying a top tier product for LED lights but in the end I was given a terrible, over priced led light that I could have gotten from amazon for a 1/3 of the price. I thought going with and LED specific company would pay off but I would not recommend this product to anyone and just refer you away from this website to either amazon or another led light strip company."

If you are selling LED Sauna lights with adhesive... you'd think the adhesive would work in a sauna... otherwise it is just decorative.  I asked for other solutions and was not offered any.  Turns out LED supply sells something called LED brackets (and in fact the description for this product says that 5 clips come with these lights- but none were enclosed with the lights).  That will likely be the only solution... and would have been a great thing to offer.  Secondly the rep offered replacement lights... I replied OK, and then he sent them saying that I need to return the first ones.  Bad communication.  Conditions should have been clear prior to sending the replacement lights"

It would have been much better to just solder all the connections on the bench. I'll say it again, these connectors are terrible. I had to redo the connections several times, the connection points were very weak. Sometimes the connection wouldn't be made, sometimes it would come loose despite being fully depressed.

          "Contenu": "ordered 2 transformers for LEDs that I want to convert to hard-wired.  received them in record time -2-3 days.  Scheduled the electrician to install, and it turned out that the wrong units were delivered.  At first I thought it was my mistake, but then I compared the numbers on the units to my order and they were off by 2 digits, meaning they were not right for the fixtures, and could not be installed. I ordered the right ones, and it took over a week to get them, and I now have to pay the electrician for the 2nd visit to install the right ones.  The units are less then 5 bucks each, so it's not even worth my time to hassle the company for a refund and return the wrong units - they're going in the trash. I'm already out the cost of my electrician's time to come out the first time...  My advice, if you must order from this place, be sure to thoroughly check that what you received is actually what you ordered."

I have bought many LED remote control cables to be able to turn the light strips on/off and dim them. The reason,  I have purchased many remotes is they seem like To fail frequently. They will work for several months and then don\u2019t work at all and  must be removed and replaced with another cable and remote. This is not the case on all installations I have done but is the case on several  of them. LED has replaced them on one or two orders at no charge and has sent me at no charge a replacement remote cable when a remote came in a package with no remote cable. For the most part I have paid to replace at least a dozen remote cables and not asked for any concession. My poor rating is base on the last time I spoke with them I was told that they really could not help me with any other problem or problems that I should try elsewhere."

I was given the recommendation and sold a driver with 3X the amount of power needed. The first driver did not work at all out for the box. I needed to purchase another. That one completely fried the Star within seconds.After working with Tech support (they were outstanding) I was than sold the correct driver and a new star. LED supply Tech support made a tremendous effort to resolve my issue but overall for a company that sells LED's all day they should have never sold me the incorrect driver, mistakes happen and that was fine. Even for the small cost amount of the Star I should not have had to purchase a new Star due to the incorrect combo recommended to me initially. They did throw in a better driver in addition to my purchased driver, and everything works great now! The initial recommendation made was a mistake, we all make those. Although it dragged out my project over a week more than it should have, I would certainly purchase again from LED supply, as when things were correctly sent it was done quickly and with free shipping. 2 stars- Bad experience with incorrect driver recommended that was 3X too much power for the LED star purchased, which in turn destroyed it. The need to buy new hardware to replace it caused friction in my mind,"

          "Contenu": "So I ordered and received some Seoul Z Power white triple-ups. When I got them (and after I called the vendor) was when I learned that by default the LEDs were wired in series, neither the description nor the order code mentioned this. But even worse the jumpers were located WAY inboard on the metal star! You need to appreciate that EVERY OTHER vendor locates all user-accessed pads WAY out toward the edge. If you locate the user pads way inboard then you need to locate \"thermal relief\" cutouts in the aluminum layer underneath the pads. Otherwise when you apply solder-melting heat you'll just have ALL the components slide off the PCB at the same time! Worse when you try and reheat the pads to put the parts back on the pads will only tolerate a few \"solder cycles\" then they'll delaminate right off the PCB and your entire assembly will become useless. I'm not even going to try and return these parts because I doubt they'll agree they are \"defective\" but in truth they are - defective by design! They're the most end-user-hostile MCPCB stars I've seen so far in this entire industry and the salesman didn't seem at all willing to acknowledge what a pile of caca he was selling (I guess because his commission checks continue to cash OK) but everyone else ought to stay well away from such a poorly thought-out design. In regard to the reply: Exactly how does \"reprimanding me for not reading some obscure note\" or taking back merchandise result in me getting in my hands properly designed products that I can actually USE the way I want and need? This is all just attitude and posturing and BS and \"the customer doesn't know or understand what he wants like we do therefore the customer is wrong\". The technical points I brought up are all completely valid and as long as that's true you are attempting to sell a horribly designed product that I can't use and hardly anyone else can either but the vendor figures so long as he mounts an intensive campaign that anyone who has trouble using his product as a doofus who can barely solder in the first place they're going to continue to get a certain amount of sales. I don't want to make this into a competitive issue but as soon as I realized what a thermal disaster this product was I immediately went to a local store and bought some units made by brand \"V\" and you just look at where they put the user pads on THEIR MCPCBs (absolute outer radius, which as I said makes it usable) so I was able to put them into service immediately instead of getting into interminable arguments about why I don't understand what a wonderfully designed product I just received. Good luck with THAT strategy!"

Even with the high density strips, I probably could have used another strip.  I don't think I would have had that problem with LED bulbs."

I took it out of the circuit, and everything works fine except no dimming. Too bad for me? ... Or is there another solution?"

I ended up receiving 10 feet of tubing that's far too large and thus unusable. Maybe this is just something that's understood but I believe it to be problematic. Regardless, I do feel like the company does a good job of packing ans shipping their items quickly."

I am planning to only point the lights at the underside of the rear cabinet to avoid a line of LED dots. This may work somewhat well but renders a lot of the parts I bought useless. I also have found that the wire to wire and wire to strip connectors are extremely difficult to undo if you haven\u2019t made a solid connection or one wire is a little out of kilter. I may have to throw some away and purchase new ones. Overall I wouldn\u2019t have started the project if I knew it was going to work out this way."

That said, shipping pricing a little wonky -- free* for small orders, not free for larger orders.  Seems backwards.  I resisted the urge to break my order of 8 lamps up into 4 orders of two lamps each.Also, one of the lamps was flaky after install (flickering).  I had ordered an extra one, and just swapped it in.   This was less expensive (in my time) than trying to get a refund (which is probably available)."

They also have a return policy of \"Unused and in resellable condition\", so I could not return it.   I posted a review that described this scenario and was later contacted by LED Supply informing me that there was a solution to buy an additional BlueTooth hub.   This did solved my issue and the switch now integrates with Alexa.   LED Supply should change their product description to let buyers know that the hub is necessary AND be more consistent in their customer responses.   They did show me that they cared by reading and replying to a less than stellar review.   I would use them again."

There was plenty of room in the connector boxes for two Romex cables."
