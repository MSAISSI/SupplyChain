          "Contenu": "I am a recruiter at a software company. Recently a candidate messaged me asking about a sales job posted on Bravado that claimed we hired in Canada, asking me for more information. We do not hire in Canada, are not currently hiring SDRs, and we've never worked with Bravado. This company is fraudulently representing us to the market in job posts that don't explicitly use our name but provide a slightly anonymized version of our company description and founding story and claim the post was created on behalf of us a client.  I would strongly urge caution to any candidate applying to the jobs posted on this site. I don't know what would happen to your information if you applied via Bravado, but you would not be speaking to a recruiter or hiring manager at the actual company you think you're applying to in this case."

The War Room or whatever is set up exactly in the same format as Reddit with the same types of questions.There\u2019s no way to track what job applications I applied to. I have no visibility into the job search process. There\u2019s no actual job board where I can look for roles.Their website doesn\u2019t detect a few large companies i worked for, so formatting looks off. There\u2019s no way to upload a simple thing such as a resume as achievements don\u2019t describe the whole story. To add insult to injury the job postings on LinkedIn don\u2019t even have the company name so I\u2019m still in the dark about what I\u2019m applying to but without any status update of any kind or the ability to even review the job post later, it all honestly feels like a waste of time."

The biggest thing I would call out is the War Room. As someone who was apart of a RIF a few months ago, having a community to go to for questions and also able to go and see past posts and conversations - has been invaluable to me. The WR is authentic and full of useful conversations and helpful from the community that isn't saturated with all of the self promotion and 'influencers' like Linkedin is. As time has gone on, I've gone from someone asking a question or two for honest help for myself to then being an active contributor to other people (especially as I've learnt things on my sales journey and job seeking). Especially since many of us in sales don't have an office full of others anymore - the Bravado community feels like you get to have that (and a place where trust me - you're gonna get the truth, but in the best way possible). Not only is the WR incredibly helpful and gives me a sense of community - the academy is a great source to learn - whether you are someone looking to get into your first role, youre a seasoned vet who needs a refresh on how best to interview, looking to switch into a new role and not sure how best to go about it is extremely helpful. All in all, I'd say Bravado is the only place I've been able to find that offers the sales community a place that keeps things real and if you're a respectful member - you will get that respect right back."

The interview process was intensive but Sonia got me through it like a good friend and personal supporter. Sonia sent me a contract temp job before even starting the new one I accepted this week. I had a few different interviews and processes going but the support I got was the make or break for why I not only continued but also got the job I really wanted. I feel very grateful I was able to work with a team that cared about me and my future and not just a job."

Contributors don't tolerate spammers and are quick to redirect unhelpful or self-promoting posts, but if you read the rules, read the tone of the forums, you'll be welcome.  Unlike other forums, there are rewards for valuable posts, which leads to more thoughtful engagement.   I'd recommend it to anybody trying to improve their own sales process and to anybody who is willing to receive honest, occasionally blunt, feedback - although a good sense of humor doesn't hurt either."

While I wasn't selected to continue the interview process for the opportunity, Olivia followed up accordingly with applicable feedback for potential future roles.

My name is Elijah Caldwell and I just wanted to take a moment of my time to reflect on a uniquely tremendous experience I just underwent with Rebecca at your company, Bravado.From the initial call all the way through to signing with the company of my dreams, Rebecca was not only there to offer her support, but also consistently went the extra mile to facilitate the warmest introductions possible as I journeyed into a new endeavor. Personally, I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re paying her to do her job, but I can assure you it\u2019s not nearly enough because her work is invaluable in every sense and meaning of the word. I\u2019d give her the ultimate raise if I were you, but hey I\u2019m just throwing it out there.I\u2019ll be referring all of my friends to Bravado because of my experience with her. As the Chief Executive, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s something you can appreciate. Know that I am more than thrilled to leave this glowing review for you all on behalf of the experience I had with Rebecca. If only this world had more angels like her, truly we would be in an even better place than we find ourselves in now.Happy to have come across Bravado and even more ecstatic to have had the experience I did with Rebecca. Hopefully everyone is as wonderful as she is. If so, you are definitely doing something right. Great job over there! Keep it up!Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.With appreciation,Elijah CaldwellTimeless\u00ae"

          "Contenu": "Hats off to the incredible Bravado team who worked their magic. I had been interviewing left and right for about four months to get out of a very toxic workplace, and escape it's silo'ed, rigid, ancient ways under arguably the most incompetent leadership. Somehow, even with an average of 5-7 in-mails a day from recruiters as a result of \u2018The Great Resignation,\u2019 the incredible team at Bravado matched me with what appears is the perfect fit on both sides. While I always preach \"never say never,\" I look forward to never being employed by a publicly traded company unless they are a rare gem that operates like a startup. Over the last year, I've reflected and asked myself where I've been happiest, where I will thrive and make the biggest mark, and one thing became apparent: Early stage startups that have brilliant, humble, transparent and forward-thinking leadership, a game-changing product that that I can be SO passionate about based on how it solves customers' challenges and creates a better future for them, and allows me the autonomy to get my job done, AND...VALUES MY INPUT! Say what?!?!  I made a top 10 list of those early stage startups after identifying what criteria is critical to assess a startup's likelihood of crazy future growth, and Bravado introduced me to two of those that were on my list!I\u2019m December, I wrapped an awesome and fast process and ecstaticly accepted the offer\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c with the second startup they introduced me to, and just in time to leave all of the bad of 2021 IN 2021, and crush life in 2022. Coming in as their second Sales hire, the opportunity is incredible. The ability to help build and shape all aspects of the company gives me chills.THANK YOU to the amazing team at Bravado\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc4a.To my fellow salespeople, Sahil and his team know which startups to watch, the ones that will explode. If you're even 1/8 as miserable as I was navigating corporate bureaucracy and politics, TAKE THE CHANCE. It will be the best learning experience, and the most fulfilling career move you'll make."
