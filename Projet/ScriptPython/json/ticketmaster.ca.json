          "Contenu": "I was unable to purchase 5 tickets, because there were only groups of three remaining for purchase. Due to their policy, you cannot orphan a seat, which means I couldn't purchase less than 6 seats. I thought considering there was no other option to purchase a group of 5 seats they would reconsider their policy for the sale. But they gave me the run around via email and phone for two days, I repeatedly asked to speak to someone who could help me book the tickets, but was sluffed off. I asked twice to speak to a manager and they never provided any contact for a manager and no manager contacted me. I give up, both of our losses they lose a 5 ticket sale, and we don't get to see the event. :("

I'm used to dealing with Ticketmaster's arrogant, monopoly-driven, AI-reliant way of doing business, and their service charges for no work on their part, so I went in with my eyes open, fully expecting to be annoyed at some point but prepared to deal with it. Even I was surprised, though, by the sheer number of hoops their system demanded I go through \u2014 even demanding that I change my password at one point, then making it difficult for me to do that, and then blocking me from proceeding further. I will not be treated that way anymore. Goodbye Ticketmaster. I'm out. You're done. End of."

The show itself was kind of lacklustre. The volume of the movie I felt wasn\u2019t loud enough and the live orchestra, the part I was looking  forward to and obviously the reason why we paid a lot more money to see the movie, didn\u2019t really add to the experience of the movie. I actually forgot there was a live orchestra playing because it just sounded like it was regular music from the movie. I get that the orchestra wanted to blend in with the movie but I had hoped that it would have been more obvious of a difference\u2026and for me there wasn\u2019t. We ended up leaving during intermission. I would never spend the extra money to see a movie with a live orchestra okaying again. I found there to be no difference and I walked away upset that I paid $150 to basically watch a movie."

The male duo team was entertaining and impressive, otherwise, we were a bit disappointed with the overall experience.  Perhaps our fault for not doing our research on it before buying tickets.

As someone who does not purchase tickets all that often, they could have been a much better job identifying this to potential purchasers.We travelled 1.5 hours to get the event only to be told at the door it was 19+ only and with no recourse had to leave the event and be out of pocket, not see the band and then drive 1.5 hours back home.Horrible experience all around."

We just got to our seats which were right near the entrance we went in a few minutes before the national anthem started. Once in the venue we went down to use the washroom and the concourse was so jammed with people that you couldn't tell where lines were for anything and we didn't make it back to our seats until over halfway through the second period. All of this time was just trying to get through the jam of people to the stairs up. The game itself was good but just seemed very poorly organized and planned."

They were completely unprepared for us and it took over 40 minutes to get in, when it's a few minute walk from the Go. I've never walked in so many ridiculously long lines going no where, it was so poorly managed. Absolutely terrible. Then to add insult to injury, we were charged $10 for a bag of popcorn, $7 for a bottle of water and $17 for a beer...unforgivable! We will find other affordable music venues like Chudleighs in Milton who hosts great cover bands and charge $7.95 a beer. They want people to enjoy an affordable night and not feel pillaged like we did. There's no rationale to overcharge at the level this venue charges, it's beyond excessive."

          "Titre": "Purchase of tickets AND entry to the concert was a HASSLE!",
          "Contenu": "When purchasing the tickets, everything went smoothly up until the moment of payment where it didn't work because I entered a landline for the phone number. There was no indication that there would be a text message sent to this number in order to proceed and complete the purchase of the tickets. I entered the landline phone number to match the credit card of the person purchasing the tickets, but had no idea that the code required to complete the purchase of the tickets would be sent via text message to this number. So we had to go back and start the whole process over again and the second time the seats we had initially booked were no longer available. This was because those seats were not showing up as available due to OUR OWN previous order attempt for those specific seats. We were panicking since there were hardly any options with 4 seats together for our party of 4. After waiting several minutes with frequent refreshing (and having another family member helping us look for tickets on another computer), FINALLY our same seats that we had booked the first time finally popped up as being available again. The system for entry is finicky and discriminatory. The fact that people can't print out their tickets and bar codes in advance and that entry requires a smart phone is discriminatory. My husband dropped me off with our 2 kids (8 and 10) and went to park so we wouldn't have to walk so far and so we wouldn't be late because of all the traffic (pretty-much stopped). So we were entering separately from my husband, who had access to the tickets through his account. Such a hassle that I couldn't have printed out our tickets at home or that he couldn't just send me a screen shot of the bar code for us to enter, but he had to send me the link to his account AND send me his pw because I have to be actively logged in to his account to show a \"moving\" bar code. I only recently obtained a small amount of monthly data on my phone; I used to have NO DATA on my phone. What if this concert took place only a short time ago when I didn't have any data on my phone and therefore I couldn't enter on my own with our kids? We would've had to wait 20-30 min outside in the pouring rain for my husband to FIND US AND JOIN US (no easy task in a huge crowd outside the building)! I personally know people who don't have smart phones (only a flip phone with no data), and couples who share one cell phone between the two of them, and this system does not take into consideration these types of people. People might be coming from different locations than the other members of their party. Or what if the battery died on someone's phone? So many potential obstacles! As we were entering, we got stuck behind some people in line who were having trouble with bringing up some of the bar codes on their phone (scanned for only one member in their party but not the rest) while people in the other lines moved quickly ahead. Did I mention it was a torrential downpour and my phone is not waterproof either? I want to have my phone ready, with the moving barcode ready to go, but I also don't want my phone to die from getting wet in the rain. The concert tickets were a gift to our kids from the grandparents, but it's good we took them to the concert instead of the grandparents. I doubt the grandparents would even have been able to get in with all the fancy tech required for entry. Please take into consideration that not everyone who wants to attend a concert has the latest smart phone with all the bells and whistles and data to go with it."

When you add your tickets to Apple Wallet it only shows one. However, you can tap it at the entrance 4 times because you have 4 tickets. Please be advised also that there would be no barcode for tickets in a digital wallet. If in case you are having difficulties accessing your tickets on the Day of the event, you may go to the Resolution Window located normally near the venue\u2019s main entrance, for assistance on your mobile tickets. Just make sure to show them your credit card used in purchasing the tickets, Valid ID, and order number (44-54259/QUE).)but wallet only scanned once.

National costumes and dance are not offensive. You couldn't even recognize the sugar plum fairies in this production. The costumes are part of what made this  production special. Unless you were familiar with each piece of music you hand no idea of what was happening. This ballet dates back to 1892 and it is a shame to see it manipulated to match todays outlook."

Prices are inflated and everyone rushing to ensure a good seat just makes you accept a lesser seating arrangement only to find oiut a month or so later several new show dates have been added and some people got better priced tickets than us because it appeared only two seats were available together and they were on the floor ...that was for the matinee Nov 19....After many attempts to get tickets printed it was obvious we had to try another approach or not see the show....so through friends and several attempts we got our tickets on the phone and didn't feel comfortable until they were scanned at showtime.....According to friends who purchased their tickets for an additional show, they seem to have gotten a better deal...compared to our floor seats for $235. Not happy with whole process but The show was great because it was about our home province of Newfoundland."

I understand AGLC has it's rules, but this was definitely overkill.

I think most people felt the same as half of the venue cleared out as soon as the movie ended.  At that point I thought the last song was the the finale, but then they did a few more songs and a mash up.  The only reason I knew it wasn't over, was because the lights didn't come on.The performers were talented, no doubt.  But the show itself should have been laid out better or a program issued so we'd be aware of what was happening throughout."

          "Contenu": "Concert was excellent, very organized once inside the venue.*Would like to have the option of printing tickets via Ticketmaster.Parking situation was a nightmare at the Abbotsford Events Centre.  We arrived by car two blocks down the street from the venue an hour before the concert start time and it took over an hour to get into the parking lot from the street. We then had to eventually park in the furthest parking lot from the venue doors in the adjoining college.  Many people in this parking lot were confused as to where to purchase parking and how to walk to the venue from this location.  By the time we purchased a parking ticket and walked back to the doors of the venue, we missed the first 40 MINUTES of the concert , arriving in our assigned seats at 8:40pm. (Concert was scheduled to start at 8:00pm).We have been to events in this venue in the past and it has never taken this long to get into the parking lot and then park a vehicle.  In the past, the venue has had flag persons assisting vehicles on the road, and at the signal lights, into the venue parking lot to keep traffic organized.  There were many other attendees in this same situation. (The concert itself was excellent)."

I.e., if the VIP ticket includes a merch package to be picked up at a certain desk, it would be great if the staff noticed this when scanning our tix and pointed out the desk or other line/location. Would be efficient and save time for patrons to navigate through the crowded entrances."

Vancouver has its own great comedians I\u2019d rather have seen as an opening act. The 3rd floor bar was closed and that meant 2nd floor bar was more crowded. Oh well. Seats, site lines & acoustics are all great. All in all, a very worthwhile event once again at QE Theatre. Thank you."

This was a pain, not everyone is tech savy and I had to go with them to the door and had to write sticky notes for them to keep in their pockets with the details of their seats, so if they went to the bathroom they wouldn't forget.

With all that said, we thoroughly enjoyed the Wiggles \"Ready, Steady, Wiggle\" tour performance in Hamilton.  These folks were awesome, and I was never so excited to sing \"Fruit Salad\" or \"Baby Shark\".   My kids, who are adults, loved seeing the live performance and enjoyed every minute of it singing along and doing the choreography.  It's way different being there than watching it online,  but now we have our very own experience to remember.   So much audience participation and interaction and the age of the audience was very mixed:  from young kids to grandparents."
