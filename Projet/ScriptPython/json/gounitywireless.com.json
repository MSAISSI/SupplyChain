          "Contenu": "I signed up for a phone giveaway. I was contacted by emails twice assuring me the phone would arrive in 7- 10 days. They even gave me the phone # saying i could make use of this number until the actual device showed up. I never used the phone #, i would use it when the device arrived. But it never arrived, contacting Unity they repeated that i would recieve the device in 7-10 days. Today has been near a month and still i have no phone and getting through to customer service is an automated system which actually loops back to itself when your selecting choices through the keypad. I am more than frustrated and can not endorse them as my primary phone carrier. Right now, i am hetting by with a VoIp app over the internet asy phone. Which does not act in the same manner as a personal phone does."

And the tablet they tell you is this that and another. And in turn you'll get a tablet that isn't worth the 10 bucks you gave them. And to try to call them and ask them about it they just hang up on you. They say all this about its a free program and they can offer it because of the government. Sure their so called free program costs you 10. From the jump then when their garbage breaks you get to spend more money as they reap the bennifits of the money being made from the government. And what I mean is when have you ever seen a company that's not making hardly anything off of something bennifit from it? Well in the 47 years I've been alive I havnt seen it once."

          "Contenu": "Wow!!You want to know my experience through Unity Wireless? Here you go\u2026 I signed up for the Acp program for the tablet with unlimited data but received a SIM card instead, so I figured OK the SIM card is supposed to go into the tablet, so I\u2019ll waited for the tablet to arrive. The tablet never arrived, so I gave support a call. I was informed that I didn\u2019t qualify for the tablet because I hadn\u2019t paid for the tablet, (Miind you it advertises free tablet with unlimited data through the ACP program.)so I said OK I\u2019ll pay for the tablet. They then sent me an invoice through my account with them, to pay for the tablet. Then came the waiting game for the tablet to arrive. I was so excited. I figured this would fix Everything. I was wrong. Once it arrived, I noticed, that the tablet I received was not the tablet that was advertised on their website. The tablet advertised already had the data applied to it, there was no Sim card needed. the tablet I received, however, was called \u201cMy Tab Pro.\u201dBut I gave them the benefit of the doubt I placed the sim card inside the tablet, only to have nothing happened. It kept telling me that I had no data, so I gave support a call, letting them know what I was experiencing with the tablet, and was told \u201cwe apologize. That was our fault. The tablet was not activated. If you\u2019ll turn it off for 10 minutes and then turn it back on it should be fine\u201d,so I did so. When I turned it back on and tried to use it, I still received the same message that I had no data.  I gave support yet another call letting them know what I was experiencing with the tablet, this time I was told to turn it off for 30 minutes. Only what they didn\u2019t know is I already turned it off for 30 minutes and it still had not   worked. I knew it was not going to work. And so I called them back yet again but this time I was told shut it off again for a longer period of time and it should work, but please do not contact us through phone anymore contact us through the website. I\u2019m thinking to myself. What is the phone number on there for, if we\u2019re not to contact you through it? So now, here I am  stuck with a Sim card and a tablet but they\u2019re charging I guess ACP for something that\u2019s not even being used. And it\u2019s my understanding that if you don\u2019t use that Sim card you lose your ACP but you\u2019re still charged by the company that you\u2019re going through? so how do I get rid of this garbage? This is so not worth stress and that\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s giving me stress."

And to only get either a phone or tablet by buying at a price I cannot afford is impossible since I have no income at all hence the reason why I was hoping for a free phone or tablet to help me through my situations. I see that even with me trying to get back on my feet to gain employment, get back into school and gain my own business would have to be put on hold until I can get something like a phone or tablet to help me out. If only someone has a heart to give and not think about the consequences of being helpful to a needy person like me would it help me to know hope still lives on this day and time."

No answers and you have a co-pay for the tablets and I didn't want another tablet that is so slow and outdated that it's useless, and that's what I got. I didn't receive the tablet advertised, I received one that barely functions and doesn't have any of the specs advertised.

The battery on this tablet drains exactly 3 times as fast as my OLD Samsung.Bottom line...talk & text may be OK. But if you need data connectivity, this is not the answer."

This company isn't open on the weekends and I know for a fact my zip code is not in the 913 area code.. I'm gonna look into different company that is if I can actually get online..

I asked to be taken off list to be removed as a customer so far they have not done so they are continually sending me emails about using my phone and other stuff about a phone I don't want or their service and as of this review they have not done what they said they were going to do I would not recommend unity wireless to my worst enemy"

Send it message and got a quick responses - got a SIM card yesterday and now the phone works properly and the tablet still does not have a internet connection.

If you do get connected and actually talk to someone, they are very professional and nice!! Customer service is a MAIN FACTOR in any services you may need and that\u2019s the reasoning in why I didn\u2019t give but 3 stars.

Because just about a week or so ago repeatedly called them for over a period of three weeks after receiving finally my SIM card I thought would\u2019ve been included with the phone purchase delivery. And having the phone charged up for weeks The phone wasn\u2019t even working at all. Didn\u2019t want to try it until receiving the actual Sim card. I have repeatedly called their customer service requesting that they send me a working unit it\u2019s still brand new in the actual box it had came in. Now I am upset angry is disturbed from poor bad business practice activities you would\u2019ve thoughts someone replace this unit by now after making numerous of calls to inform them of this problem up on very disrespectfully plus some. Oh they could continue telling you to go online and file a claim. I did that the app doesn\u2019t allow you to go any further and now enough is enough. I\u2019m waiting to receive a full unit working it\u2019s a paid service federal government paid plan gotten actually really ridiculous overwhelmed but disturbed by all this again it\u2019s like you\u2019re getting the runaround like they don\u2019t care Customer Service is bad I\u2019m appalled from so much bad, poor utterly service, not being rendered properly. Isn\u2019t fixed and they don\u2019t send me a brand new unit I\u2019m gonna be following FCC and federal and state charges, as well as Consumer Protection and Regulatory already started the procedures I wait for a replacement happen too many issue problems in their system how dare unbelievable."
