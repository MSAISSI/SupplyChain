You guys icresed the prices before the black friday and when you cut it down you came to the exact same price as it was before the black friday. You are so fake and this is annoiyng. I know this because i wanted to purchase memberpress before the pro version was 260 dolars. When i looked during black friday there was saiyng that you decresead the price from 700 and aomething to 260 so in what universe did you discount the prices???? Everything is just a scam!"

          "Contenu": "Appalling customer service and false advertising - after paying for the top Pro package ($599 a year for 5 sites), discover that staging/dev sites are not included.  This is despite their own blog articles saying how important staging is and on their FAQs (updated 2nd September 2021) it says:If I purchase the basic, and am only allowed one site, do I have to migrate to and from a dev (test) site?Even with MemberPress Basic you are allowed to have one live site and one Dev site with the same license,  so you will have no issues installing on both sites.However doesn't work, and their useless customer support keeps ignoring me pointing out the comment on their website and says I have to either pay, or just remove the licence from production and put onto dev every time I want to test things.  No other premium plugin I pay for requires this - they all recognise staging.domain.com as staging (or in the case of Jetpack, supply you with some code for the WPconfig).Their attitude to someone who's paid that much for a plugin is appalling considering their plugin is the most expensive and I've only added it to the tech stack to make integration with the CRM a bit easier - now going to explore how to just use the others without it (as I previously used to). I won't support a money-grabbing developer who doesn't seem to understand the importance of staging.  Or at the very least offer heavily discounted staging licences if on a domain that has a full one."

          "Contenu": "Edit: Memberpress are trying their hardest to have this review removed. It has been edited umpteen times but it stands firm as the only things here are facts.It's very important to note that the subscription model has changed. Once your subscription runs out, memberpress locks you out of the memberpress dashboard until you reactivate it by renewing your subscription.I am copy/pasting from their own website to mitigate this being taken down again.---What happens when my subscription ends?You enter a grace period where MemberPress will still operate as usual.After the grace period ends:You won\u2019t have access to any of the MemberPress admin screens. ----In more detail: Everyone should be aware that the subscription model has changed from previous versions of Memberpress since the company was brought out. Previously the plugin would work like almost all other Wordpress plugins in as much as the the software is released under a GNU Public License and the fee you pay is effectively for 12 months of plugin updates & customer support. With this model, if you didn't renew a subscription, your plugin would still work perfectly well, it was just outside the support and update contract.Memberpress on the other hand have changed the way they want to work, and now, once your 12 month subscription is up, the plugin will lock you out of the Memberpress dashboard options so you can no-longer manage any of your memberships; you are completely and totally locked out from accessing your own data.The ONLY way to keep using the plugin fully is to keep paying whatever fee they ask for which will unlock your dashboard for another 12 months. My advice is to avoid at all cost, this is unethical and goes against the spirit of open source Wordpress plug-in development which traditionally requests payment for support and security updates - it is not forced payment.If your business relies on memberpress they can effectively force you to pay whatever fee they come up with to retain full functionality of your website.Google \"Memberpress locked out\" for more on this within the Wordpress community...My advice is to buy from ThemeForest who offer LIFETIME updates."

Just 4 questions will have you go beyond the refund limit of 14 days.Memberpress is a dud and almost cost us AUD$700 when the price was exchanged from Australian dollars to US dollars.It was an expensive lesson. What's worse, we researched the hell out of them before starting - but you can only rely on their word - which was full of fraudulent lies."

Sometimes I had to wait for 4 days to get a response.* The software was not easy to use.* They have several options for credit cards, PayPal (3 options), Stripe and pay by check. *The reality.* None of the PayPal integrations worked. I spent 10 hours going back and forth with PayPal and MemberPress and all of the integrations failed.* I installed Stripe and according to the software, the installation was perfect. The first and only time it was used, it failed.* The affiliate program was not automated, as we were led to believe. The manual setup was a deal breaker.* When we asked for a refund, despite all of the problems, they stated that we went outside of the refund time and refused to refund the money.+++ In my opinion, this is fraud. Whatever you do, don't buy this software. The company IS NOT trustworthy."

There are multiple screens/popups to get through with offers and warnings to scare you into remaining a subscriber. These screens are purposefully designed to make it difficult to leave (e.g. cancellation buttons that don't appear until you've checked multiple boxes). I'm sure someone from the company will reply that they are trying to offer value, and ensure customers understand that they will no longer have security updates if they stop paying - but realistically I think it's pretty plain why they do this!I really dislike that when you sign up you are automatically opted in for yearly renewal! In my opinion, the honest approach is to ask a customer their preference when signing up (and to make it easy  for them to opt out).Based on my recent experience I will unfortunately be considering other options when redesigning my site."

I also ran into a caching issue that forced me to disable the cache completely on my website which is less than ideal.

And I appreciate the blog content they share regularly to educate their users about the different aspects of creating a successful membership site. I highly recommend using MemberPress for all your membership site needs."

So, I switched to MemberPress. Migrating current users along with Pay Pal profiles was definitely a challenge and we ran into some issues because it wasn't a new install. What's important to point out however, is the support I received during this transition/migration. MemberPress support is always there and they respond quickly. They're very knowledgeable and have been able to resolve my issues and assist in getting everything working as designed. I couldn't be more pleased with the MemberPress support and I would highly recommend this plugin for anyone with a Word Press site."

          "Contenu": "I had created a problem with my account renewal, completely my fault. The result\u2026renewing to the wrong package and loosing access to my multiple licences. As I said, it was completely of my own doing and not in any way caused by MemberPress itself. Having said that, the support at MemberPress was absolutely first rate. I sent them a support ticket advising of my \u2018stuff up\u2019 and within a very short time I had a response from Predrag at support assuring me the problem would be fixed. Another message followed with a couple of steps they needed me to do, followed by a confirmation that it was all sorted. Not only that, they refunded me the money that I had incorrectly paid for the wrong renewal package. And if that wasn\u2019t enough, they actually put me on a different plan that was way more effective for my needs and a lot cheaper than what I\u2019d been paying. Honestly, I\u2019ve been blown away by this experience, they really did go way beyond what they needed to and I\u2019m most grateful to them. Next year at renewal time\u2026I\u2019ll pay a bit more attention to what I\u2019m actually doing, but I have no doubt that if I encounter any problems then, or in the year ahead, they will go out of their way to assists me."
