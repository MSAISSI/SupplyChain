Second, you can ask your question on English words that you cannot make out in written dictionaries. Answers you get are personal and hard to go out of your mind elsewhere.Third and last, I make the same mistakes over and over again. Maybe I started correcting my voice too late. I am struggling how to pronounce as effortlessly as possible to be understood. That is the kind of practice I need to repeat, albeit late. Nothing can be late in life if you are determined to speak without accent."
