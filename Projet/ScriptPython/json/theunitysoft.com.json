          "Contenu": "Having not yet activated the MS software license that I had been sent I had requested pre-installation advice on the adequacy to run on a Mac platform.This led to a large amount of emails in both directions which made me more and more uneasy resulting in me choosing not to use the license that I was sent.So, still being within the 14 day cooling off period, I requested a refund.First of all I was told that they do not do refunds. Then they wriggled and wriggled seeming to ignore my refund request.I pointed out the relevant clauses in the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 for distant selling and cooling off but got no reply. Section 34 (4) states that a refund must be provided without undue delay.  Section 34 (7) states the trader must make the reimbursement using the same means of payment, Mark Smith had originally stated that he did not even know how they had been paid.The following day I advised them that Which? Legal department had suggested asking them why they might feel that this cooling off period did not apply to them. I received a refund immediately.Incidentally, under their refund policy, they have a link to Which?  where it outlines the essentials of this act. When I advised Which? of this link they were most surprised.They are very closely meshed with unitedsoftware.co.uk with both companies having the same office in Miami, Florida; and here they are trying to use UK law.Names that came up in the above process were Guido Augusto Beggino (named as the authorised representative for Trusted Shops Trustmark, and could be the boss), Mark  Smith (level 2 support agent who front lined all communication) and Tom Morgan (the refunder).Mark Smith expressed in the refund notification email \u201cDeeply sorry for the inconvenience.\u201d"

They told me to use the key in the emails. This is a different key to the key provided on the website, but not made clear. I explained to the agent that this wasn't clear, that it was a different product key, he kept arguing with me saying that the instructions on the website are clear. IT DOES NOT SAY TO FOLLOW SEPERATE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE EMAIL where it lists the product key for the upgrade. Moving on, I follow the instructions, and it fails, says exception error could not activate. Mesaged them again and 'Tom' who is the agent i spoke to before, told me 'customers are stupid because they don't read' - I know what Im doing when it comes to computers, but he was being really rude and condescending when what the instructions were telling me to do were not working. He also told me not to restart my computer, then told me I need to restart my computer for it to work. It then said that the license is not valid, and so had to do the process all over again. It worked the second time. But 'Tom' was adamant that I was not doing it right. I told him I am going to make a complaint about him, and he begged me not to after he realised he was in the wrong when i sent him screenshots. Boy this guy needs to get fired."

          "Contenu": "I purchased Office 2019 Home & Student 2019 on Sept 26, 2019.I started get alert that I only have few days left on the license and need to activate.  I re-entered the product key provided from unitysoft and the message still appears.  I contacted the unitysoft and received an e-mail that I should contact softwaregeeks.  I purchased the product from unitysoft, not softwaregeeks (never even heard of softwaregeeks).  I replied to the email to unitysoft, and no response from unitysoft yet.After reading Rob's review, I am having the same issue but I purchased the product key from unitysoft, not softwaregeeks.  The email I received from the unitysoft is exactly sames as the response they wrote on Rob's comment.Update: The company contacted me again, after I wrote the review.  They wanted me to send the screenshot of the error and I sent them right away (also they said they would \"appreciate correction of the review made once resolved\").  Now it has been 4 days and no response from the company. Here is the correction of the review.  The license may work for some people but it didn't work for me.  Based on my experience with this purchase, I would have been better off buying the license from more reputable company considering my license got suspended after four weeks.  I should have read the description more carefully and realized that this company is sketchy.  It indicates that the license is for lifetime but the company only gives 1 year warranty on the license key.  In my case, license only lasted 4 weeks, without proper tech support from the company.Update:  They sent another email and said they never received my screenshot, only after I updated the review.  I checked my sent emails and I sent them on Oct 24 and another email to verify if they received my screenshot on Oct 25, to the email address they provided.  I sent another email on Oct 29, to the same e-mail address as below for the third time and no response from their support team again.  I am frustrated with their support team that I ended up buying another license from MS.  I won't be emailing them again nor update this post any further."

Supp. (CS) takes a long time to reply and their reply is asking questions that I answered with info provided previously in that same email. They don\u2019t read your emails!! I provided my laptop specs three emails prior and finally they made a statement that Win 7 Pro cannot upgrade Vista Home. I have asked for Win 7 Home replacement for Win 7 Pro, but no response. It appears they will only respond to these reviews and not to a CS email asking for help. NOTE; CS is NOT 24/7 as advertised on Web site. They respond when they get around to it. Let\u2019s see if this review helps!!Update: Writing a bad review worked!! If you cannot get a response I suggest you do the same. Within an hour I received a response, however, the response was an obvious issue that should have pointed out after my 1st email request for support. I did what they said and still had the same issue. I emailed back again explaining the issue and again giving details of the problem, and TWO DAYS later they responded with OH this is a \"COMMON\" issue with Windows Update/Install. Common Issue?? WHY could you not tell me that in the beginning and save me a huge headache!and complete waste of my time!! I got tired of waiting for their response, so I ended up performing a clean install of Win7 Home Premium, losing all of my installed Software and settings. I have spent several days reinstalling software and re-configuring most of my settings.I changed my rating to 2 stars only because the software did install correctly and the License Key was Genuine per Microsoft. If any other info. comes up I will update again."

Just in case anyone else is using Windows on Mac, this is how to solve it:Since I am running Windows with another splitting program on my MAC (Parallels), you need to specifically restart Windows within Parallels, and not restart the MAC device. I tried restarting my MAC many times (as the instructions state restart your PC) but it didn\u2019t change anything, but after figuring out that specifically Windows needed to start within the splitting program, that\u2019s when it finally worked. Thank you for your help and for saving me money!"

My daughter messed up her laptop requiring a full reset and reinstall, Win 10 worked fine, but office 2019 would not reinstall and kept stating the same error each try and wanting me to use Office 365. I upgraded to Win 11 pro, which worked fine, but same error message for Office, My copy was out of warranty, and I spent hours trying to resolve it. In the end, I sent the error details to the unity soft email. Within a very short time, I had a response from Mark @theunitysoft detailing the action required to reinstall the software without the error. I followed the process provided and I was up and running office within the next 30 minutes. I needed to use the telephone activation service now everything is working in time for Christmas. Thank Mark & the Unity soft team for their awesome OOW support."
