The company should be ashamed of itself for charging their customers without reason and taking so long. I still haven\u2019t even recieved an apology email or any communication and has made me a lifelong supporter of any brand that isn\u2019t Samsung. I will be seeing legal action as well with how I was treated and charged without any rhyme or reason. Disgusted by the service provided and this is not how customer care should be handled. I\u2019m just happy I never have to deal with this company or service ever again because even if my device has issues, I\u2019d gladly rather throw it in the trash then to send it to you people once more."

When my screen on my phone broke, I was first sent to a store that couldn't fix my phone. Then I was told I would have to mail it in and be without a phone for 10-12 business days. When I was finally given another location to go to, the servicer told me I needed a claim from Samsung or I would have to pay out of pocket. Call back again because no one had given me this info. When I get to store, their computer is down and I need to transfer my claim to another location. Get to next location, claim hasn't been transferred - after calling yet again, being transferred to multiple people, I was disconnected. At this point, the store manager took pity on me and called Samsung for me. He was told that my Samsung Care+ policy had been cancelled and I didn't have coverage, despite the fact that the claim had just been issued less than 2 hours prior. Finally after several transfers we were able to get the claim sent to the correct store. After a dozen phone calls and driving to 3 separate locations, I was finally able to get my repair done. Never again. I switched to Motorola and got my insurance through my phone provider, so if this happens again, they will overnight me a new phone. Problem solved."

The Servify site said i didn't have protection on my device, which is insane because the payment comes out automatically every month. Every time I called, I got a different reason why I was having a problem. First, it was check with Samsung Financing, which I did. They could clearly see all of my payments, as could Samsung Care. 2-3 days was the time frame for the issue to be resolved. After 1 week, I was informed I could send my phone in to be fixed, which would take 10 business days, and there wasn't a guarantee I'd receive a loaner phone, so I didn't do that. I called at least 20 times for updates, because no one reached out as promised. 2 weeks have gone by at this point, and I randomly checked the site.The system error was fixed, but of course, no one let me know. I got my phone fixed the following day. I didn't hear from anyone about the update until a week after getting it fixed. I did not have any issues when the company was Assurion. Servify is terrible. They didn't even offer to cover the cost of repair after this ordeal."

I filed my claim on June 5th and It was repaired on June 11th. 6 days when asurion would have had it approved and fixed no more than 2 days. I had to also take off from work to drop it off which was inconvenient when I could have scheduled Sunday when I was off.In addition they also flagged this review and calling me a liar when I have documentation to prove my claim. This is unacceptable Servify. Your company never requested documentation from me until I called and it took 3 days to review my documentation. In addition your customer service lied and said verification would only take 24 hours until I was told no one could do it on the weekend. 6 days for a screen repair is unacceptable."

Then I decided to connect my coverage into the OnePlus Care app just to make sure I was still covered. The app kept saying \"already reedeemed\".Once contacted, after 3 weeks and multiple emails, Servify told me that their coverage was actually not covering Canadian people, that's why I was refunded. They did not offer any workaround, and now that I purchased this phone more than 30 days ago I have zero solution to purchase extra insurance for my phone.At the end of the day, I am not lawyer but I think this is called false advertising, and this does not look good at all from a legal perspective."

In the mean time they have flagged my report on trustpilot because they are saying it s false or makes negative statements?!?! Just shows what a sham of a company they truly are. NO ONE SHOULD INSURE ANYTHING WITH THIS SCAM OF A COMPANY!I have had my galaxy s22 ultra for well over a year. Bought it directly from Samsung and decided to go w their insurance that they offered via servify. Fast forward 1 year and I try to file a claim w servify because I accidentally dropped my phone and it landed screen side down and broke. First time I called servify I was transferred around to four different people and we definitely had a language barrier. The final guy I spoke to said that samsung had not sent them any money for my insurance so they could not help me until the money is received. Said he put in a request since system showed I had a policy and to call back in 10 days. Call 2 nearly the same occurrence,  passed around said money transfer was pending from samsung and call back in 10 days. When I began to question their companies bs policy the call mysteriously was dropped. Call number 3 spoke to 5 different people who were of no help and absolutely useless at their job. Finally a \"manager\" got on who  gave me same bs as last 2 calls but then proferred up a work order number for me to use when I call back in, you guessed it, 10 more days!!! After he gave me the work number he thanked me and hung up before I could reply. Call 4 I speak w 6 different reps who were all clueless and just doing their obvious job to frustrate the customer and get them off the phone without covering any claim. I would ask for a manager but NONE were ever available. After wasting almost 3 more hours on the phone w obvious con artists I hung up and logged in to cancel my insurance on the samsung website. The next day I got notice of my request ro cancel along w another text from servify telling me my coverage was being canceled for non payment! What the actual F?? I love samsung and all their products they have but DO NOT EVER SEEK COVERAGE FOR ANYTHING VIA SERVIFY. They are cheats and scam artists and I am very disappointed that samsung would associate w such a low class company! And my phone screen is still AFU. SERVIFY IS HORRIBLE!"

In order for them to process that they needed to place a $953.99 hold for each device on my payment method. I, at the time, didn't have the option for that with my credit limit or available cash on hand. I reached out to support on three different occasions, the first time I was on hold for over a hour with no response. I decided then to email them in which I finally got a response three days later. I finally got ahold of someone on the second time calling on the second day of no response to my email in which I was told there was nothing they could since that was the only option provided when opening a claim and they couldnt waive it. I had to resort to getting a temporary line of credit with a impact on my credit score to simply get my devices fixed. Once getting the funds available for a temporary hold, I come to find out that when they ship the devices it is for weekday delivery only. I could understand if this was going to a business but to a residential address. This doesn't really work for low income or limited income consumers. This doesnt work for someone that needs their devices quickly if you open the claim on Fridays or the Weekend. Between this and the other hassles I have had before including never receiving a refund for my claim that wasn't processed even with numerous emails I couldn't recommend this to anyone, get the insurance from your provider. I wish I could say it was better.Update:After going through and getting the line of credit I did end up getting my devices replaced. Still haven't had my other portion of this review addressed nor am I overly satisfied with the process. Still would not recommend."

Total time 16 mins.Agents spoke with a terrible accident and the connection was spotty at best.Agents attitude was very unpleasant.Called again, after 15 mins, I was told that the policy is with servify.tech.Called servify.tech - I was rudely informed that the claimed had to be filed via the website.Submitted the claimed with the police report.2 Days LaterCalled servify.tech - I was rudely informed that the claim takes 3-5 business days to process. 18 minute call.4 Days LaterNo new updatesCalled servify.tech - It took the agent 19 minutes to find out that it's still in process. i was told that it would be \"A LITTLE TIME\" to process. Explained the the agent that I was told it would be 3-5 business days for processing, so the agent raised the issue with their manager.I requested a call back from the manager - but first I had to explain that they could not call me back at the telephone number of the stolen phone, alternate number provided.I will not hold my breath for the call back.Day 9no call backno updates to the claimno replacement phoneDay 14it wasn't until I emailed several of the co-owners, via LinkedIn, that finally something got done.Day 17FedEx is suppose to deliver the replacement phone today."

This company has tried to twist every line in their contract not to pay out a warranty claim, they quoted:(Fortuitous events; including, but not limited to : environmental conditions, exposure to weather conditions or perils of nature; collapse, explosion or collision of or with another object; fire, any kind of precipitation, lightning, dirt/sand, smoke, nuclear radiation, radioactive contamination, riot, war or hostile action are not covered')So the phone starting to smoke inside a vehicle, not exposed to any elements being charged by a OEM charger is a Fortuitous event apparently.

          "Contenu": "I feel compelled to share my recent harrowing experience with Asurion, which turned out to be an absolute disaster. Instead of fixing my phone as promised, their incompetence and negligence led to an expensive replacement that cost me far more than it should have.Initially, I approached Asurion with the hope that they would repair my phone efficiently and at a reasonable cost. However, my hopes were quickly dashed as the repair process dragged on without any progress. Despite numerous assurances, they failed to address the issues with my phone properly.Weeks passed with no sign of my phone being repaired, and every time I reached out for updates, I received vague responses that left me more frustrated. The lack of transparency regarding the status of my repair was beyond infuriating, and it became evident that they were not making any genuine efforts to fix my device.As the situation worsened, it became apparent that Asurion's promise of a swift resolution was nothing but empty words. I had already invested time and patience into waiting for a repair that seemed never-ending, only to be left with a malfunctioning phone.Finally, I reached my breaking point and decided to demand a resolution. Instead of fixing my phone, Asurion suggested a replacement, which would cost me even more money than what I initially paid for their repair service. This additional expense was completely unjustified, considering it was their incompetence that led to this situation in the first place.In the end, I was left with no choice but to pay for the replacement. Asurion's failure to fulfill their promise of repairing my phone left me with an unnecessary financial burden, adding insult to injury.My encounter with Asurion has been nothing short of a nightmare. Their inability to carry out a simple repair resulted in additional expenses and a significant waste of my time and energy. I strongly advise everyone to think twice before trusting Asurion with their valuable devices, as their empty assurances and incompetence can lead to disastrous consequences."

There were 3 hardware issues:The back glass was broken.The lens cover was broken.The main camera was damaged.After a month of waiting, I finally got my phone back and only 1 and 2 were resolved. The camera was still damaged. I tried to resolve this with Servify at the time, but they were not willing to help me and I was tired of dealing with it so I relented.However, I just realized that they sent back a 128 GB One Plus 6!\u00a0 This is hugely frustrating, and I am livid that I did not notice earlier. I did not consider it to even be an option.I realize that you likely have some 90 day policy, but I implore you to make an exception. This kind of mistake is exceptional, and should be unacceptable to a company with any level of quality control.\u00a0Warm regards,JamesUpdate 2: (2021/07/26) Several replies from Servify I had intended to paste all the replies in here, but things have gotten messsy. Servify started replying to my original complaint email, which I made before posting this review. At this point, Servify is willing to replace the 128GB board with a 256GB board. I am inquiring about them also fixing the camera that they ignored last time I sent it to them. Admittedly, I am nervous to send the phone off to them. Last time it took a month to get the phone back, and obviously it didn't come back in the state I had hoped. We'll see what happens this time."

Hence, in order to avoid any delays, we would request you to kindly raise a chargeable request through OnePlus to have your device repaired and we shall have the repair amount reimbursed back to you minus the amount of your mandatory deductible under the contract.You may reach out to experts from OnePlus through https://supp*rt.oneplus.comWe request you to kindly let us know your response to this alternative.Should you have any additional questions/comments please feel free to write back to us at u5_support@s*rvify.tech or call us on 1833 313 3331.Thanks,AakashTeam Servify.\"personally I have never heard of a company telling a customer to pay out of pocket and then send them an invoice. I might as well be begging them to screw me over. I'm thoroughly disappointed in oneplus for offering service from this company and as much as I love my one plus phone this situation is enough for me to never buy their products again as they cant do anything about this either even though I spent 2-300 dollars on the insurance through them. I am even more disappointed in them offering this service after reading the various reviews on here and BBB. Save your money and don't buy this insurance, hell don't even buy the one plus phone, just go and buy a phone through your carriers retailer and get their insurance cause at least they will take care of you. one plus what kind of sick joke is this whole situation.-Update 1: servify has reached out to me and appears to be trying to resolve the situation. I will update back periodically with what has happened.-Update 2: they had me send the phone out to their service center in ohio-Update 3: 10/25 they called me to let me know they did not have parts availability and they would be replacing my phone. no only are they doing this but they are replacing my 1+ 7pro with an 8 pro. will update again when I receive the new phone.Update 4: on the 25th I paid the deductible, I would have assumed that this meant they would have shipped out the phone next day. I also emailed them back that it had been paid. today is the 27th and I finally got a response back, which has me rather perturbed that it took 2 days to get even a response back. not to mention that they still have not shipped out the phone. I have lowered the rating back to one star. as the email states\"Hi Cole,Greetings from Servify!Thank you for your response.Please be informed, we have forwarded your request to the relevant team to look into it. Once we get an update, we shall update you accordingly.Should you have any additional questions/comments please feel free to write back to us at us_support*servify.tech or call us on 1833 31E 3331.Regards,AakashTeam Servify\"I would have expected things to have gone much smoother with them considering the insurance has cost me 300 to begin with and now another 100 for deductible. I am extremely disappointed in this company in that it takes them extremely long for anything to happen. I will update again when I finally get tracking on the phone."

I have dealt with Samsung Customer Service on issues like screen replacements in other countries (UAE, SL, etc.), and everywhere else, it is a 2-day service even for cracked screen repairs. So, with the same expectations, I sent mine for repairs to Servify, this time while residing in the US. Boy, could I have been more wrong about my expectations! The device was delivered to them within 3 days, but there was absolutely no update on the portal for three weeks. It took 4 weeks to get a reply to my email inquiries. A phone call revealed that it was being held for a new chassis (which is understandable; it had only been a week since the phone was released), and a month and a half later was sent back with the chassis and the screen fixed but with the same VERY visible scratch on the wide-angle lens cover which blurs some images at certain angles.Now they want me to send it again for repairs which I have to pay $99 again. Guess who won't be buying any insurance that has anything to do with scammy companies like this? I plan on writing to Samsung CS so they know better than to work with these third-party services."

HAD TO RESCHEDULE TRIP DUE TO THEM LYING ABOUT WHEN I WOULD GET MY PHONE.I originally purchase the warranty for my Oneplus 6t directly from the Oneplus website back in 2018. My phone took a fall recently that shattered the back glass, so I gave them a call they guided me threw the steps necessary to ship them my phone, getting back with me within the day. I have an email stating that they will contact me when my phone arrived, good thing I'm able to track the package with UPS, the phone arrived at their facility Tue 08/11. Since I did not hear from them I reached to them on 8/15 they responded, the same day \"We would like to notify you that your device has reached our service facility and the same is under repair. We would like to confirm if the passcodes or lock pattern were removed from the device? In case, if you have not, kindly help us with the same as it will help us diagnose the device.\" - Mahesh Negi Then they kept asking me for my unlocking code for \"Diagnostics\". Then on 8/21 I get an email stating \"Apologies for the delay. Unfortunately, as we check, there has been a delay due to the unavailability of the required parts. We shall update you once we receive them and the device has been repaired.\" - Mahesh NegiThis made no sense to me because on 8/15 it was getting repaired already. On 8/24 I email them I stating that I want my phone back by 9/25/2020, I did not get a response, so I call them on 8/25 asking for them to ship my phone back ASAP even if it's not fixed, the rep. tell me to give him 2 days to resolve this. I tell him I don't mind waiting I just need my phone back by the 5th of September. On the 8/27 I get an email \"The repair is currently under progress and it should be repaired shortly. We shall update you shortly.\" -Mahesh Negi my phone is \"currently\" being repaired again. Finally, on 8/29 they send me an email that repairs are done and ready to be shipped, I correct the shipping address because of course my address isn't even there, and they send me a bill. On 8/30 they send me the same email from the day before, so I tell them that I will pay them when I get my phone back. On 9/1 They email me \"Unfortunately, it would not be possible for us to ship the device until the payment of the deductible is processed.\" -Mahesh Negi So now they are holding my phone hostage unless I pay them first. Which under normal circumstances, I would not mind but when they keep me uninformed, keep my phone over 21 days, outright lie to me about the status of my phone, and only reach out to me to collect a payment, that's too many red flags. I have responded to them saying that I will give the ransom but they will have to guarantee delivery of my phone by 9/5/2020.  I called them and they said that they would get it to me by the 5th if I paid. So while in the phone with Aakash Sunil Upadhyay (same person that told me my phone would arrive by Sat 5th of sep). After I paid they ignored the fact that I was leaving the country on the 6th and they got it delivered on the 8th of Sep. Almost like they waited on purpose so that it would arrive extra late.I gave then an extra star for the refund of the deductible."

Samsung said I could return it, but I wouldn't be able to replicate the pre-order deal, if I re-ordered. Luckily I had the insurance, and filed a claim, but the local store, uBreakiFix, didn't have the \"color\" for my screen replacement yet (they later explained to me they had to replace the entire housing of the phone, hence why the color needed to match).Anyway, I called the store a few times and was still waiting on the color. I decided to email servify to see if I could just change the repair facility and send it to Samsung instead. They sent me this boilerplate email in reponse, I don't even think they read the email, that helped with nothing and basically I had to recreate the entire ticket from scratch.At this point I was kind of ticked, and sending it to Samsung would have been 10 business days+ without the phone. Eventually I decided to wait and a week or so and they finally had the color. I dropped it off after lunch and it was fixed same day and picked up before the store closed for the day.uBreakiFix gets 5 stars because this wasn't their fault. Servify I hesitate to give more than 3 stars, because the experience was kind of garbage for a \u201dpremium\u201d insurance experience."

It looked brand new and was so fun to basically have a brand new phone. PLOT TWIST: They replaced two camera modules that were malfunctioning! I had problems with the 10x camera but thought it was software. Nope. It was hardware issue and they fixed it at no extra cost! I was surprised and extremely pleased with the quality of work they did! My screen was fixed, and my camera issue was fixed as a bonus!!! Other than the length of time I had to borrow an iPhone SE as a replacement (that drove me crazy with the iPhone keyboard) there were no complaints. The service was rendered correctly and above my original request. Well done!"

My screen cracked again so I brought it to the repair technician and she gave me Servify direct number. I spoke to Akash ( Great Servify Representative)and he had me taken care of in 10 minutes. My phone was repaired right on the spot and it took a little over an hour. I will retract my first review of Servify and will say that they are not trash and the best for Samsung phone owners. The pricing cant be beat and if you call the direct number they will take care of you instantly. And whoever recommended Akko below are out of their mind. That company are true scam artist and cheap for a reason. Thank you Servify. I will give credit where credit is due."

I have raised a claim on 22nd March for my S22 ultra. While purchasing the Samsung Care Plan, the Samsung team told me that the care plan will be served by a very reputed company \"Servify\" and they are very good at their work and very fast and customer focused, but now I am so very disappointed. When the Samsung team is trying to reach them to enquire about the delay in verification, Servify is not replying to them. When I try to reach Servify team, they ask me to approach Samsung. If Servify doesn't update Samsung, what will they do? Either Samsung should change the vendor or Servify should improve, otherwise we (customers) will have to suffer. It's a lesson for everyone to learn from me. Now what am I supposed to do? I'm really upset after paying 10k for the plan and 1.25 lakhs for my phone, I am not getting any satisfactory response either from Samsung or Servify"
