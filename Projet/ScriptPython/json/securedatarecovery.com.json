Once media was received, I received a note stating they would be able to recovery the data.  I later learned this wasn't true, but they could attempt additional recovery methods for an additional fee.  Our media was lost when shipping back to us.  SecureDataRecovery's response was 'they submitted a claim to the shipping company.'  We not only wasted our money, but now do not have the media to attempt to get it fixed anywhere else.  It contained all childhood pictures of our kids from birth to present.  Gone forever!  Do not use!"

          "Contenu": "SHIPPER BEWARE. READ THIS if you are mailing/shipping your hard drive to them. There is nothing SECURE here. I hope to save anyone here who made the same mistake I did. DO NOT SEND YOUR HARDDRIVE TO THEM if you plan on relying on their shipping, which is basically relying on the awful company that FED EX is (rampant theft and lost packages with no liability). I made the huge mistake of accepting SECURE DATA RECOVERY\u2018s offer for overnight shipping, which they claimed to have \u2018insured.\u2018 For anyone reading this, PLEASE, if you value your hard drive and priceless data, ALWAYS, take out THIRD PARTY INSURANCE in order to save your data if anything happens to your hard drive. If your hard drive is lost (or STOLEN, like mine was) then third party insurance \u2018might\u2018 lessen the blow financially. The most important thing to know is that the insurance they use through Fed Ex, means ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, since Fed Ex only compensates up to 100 dollars for any lost or stolen package, with or without insurance. To make a long story short, they overnighted my hard drive ( from Fort Lauderdale, Florida) via Fed Ex with insurance. Their main office is in Ohio. My package arrived in an empty and open box to the Fed Ex in Ohio. The package had made it to their main Fed Ex Hub in Memphis Tennessee location, so apparently either someone working at Fed Ex stole my hard drive from the Memphis location, or they stole it at the Ohio facility. In the end these companies could care less since they are covered legally in the fine print.Overall, the response from Secure Data Recovery was pretty deadpanned and 'procedural' with minimal words or feedback. No real apologies. All they could do was file a claim with Fed Ex for $100.00 compensation and they tacked on $60 dollars for their \u2018estimate\u2019 of what my hard drive cost. My wish for them is that they would have a disclaimer on their website regarding their shipping options. Yes, it\u2018s obvious that anyone runs a risk sending their package anywhere, but why would you work a company that has been experiencing more and more cases of theft. And why would you not WARN your potential customers of this happening? Overall, if I could rewind, I would never ever ever ship my hard drive anywhere. Lesson learned. I would work with someone local even if more expensive. DO NOT take a chance and rely on what shipping companies have become these days."

However in the process, they tried to slander the other company I worked with, and sent them legal documents for signature in which I had the legal contract with them, that they didn't uphold to. How unethical is that?!? Yikes! Then on top of that they said they recovered all my data in which they only got about 1/4th of it, and told me I needed to prove what was missing (sorry I failed to take a photo of the drive capacity before it was accidentally damaged, I think that's a very unreasonable expectation). And when I did find holes in the recovery they said \"that isn't enough holes\" to warrant further investigation. This could have been resolved with simple communication, however during all this they wouldn't answer their phones (cowards?) so it could only be discussed over email. What kind of company does that? You might get OK work, but you will get truly horrible customer service. Just watch out before you go to them before data recovery!"

I highly recommend looking for a different company to recover your data.TLDR: Their actual price is way more expensive than the service they provide. They never returned the drive I sent in for repair. It's under warranty but without the drive I can't get it replaced.I had a hard drive failure in August of 2021. I reached out to this company for a quote. Although they were hesitant to give me a range they told me the services I was asking for generally was between 600 - 1k. A bit pricey but I moved ahead with it as my drive was under warranty and if I wanted it replaced I needed to use a place that was certified by the drive company. When I sent in the drive the quote came back north of 2k. If I had known that was a possibility I would have shopped around to check out other places. After calling to complain about this multiple times, and being shuffled around from my original contact, they brought the price down to 1k. Which although expensive I was thankful for and was able to commit to. They recovered a fair amount of my files but not all. 500 gb out of 2 tb. They sent me a new drive, but never returned the old drive so I could send it in under the warranty. I followed up about 4-5 times via phone after not hearing back over 3 emails. Finally they said they would send the drive back, and when they did sent it to the wrong address. Supposedly fed ex's fault. After following up again and being guaranteed it would be rectified it's now February of 2022 and I have yet to get the drive back. At this point I'm not even sure I'll still be under warranty if they ever do get the drive back. DO NOT USE THEM!"

When I finished, I found that none of the tax or business files I desperately needed were there.  Many of the photos were corrupted.  I think I picked the wrong company to recover my data.  In addition to only getting a fraction of my files, I was extremely disappointed with the extra five weeks they took to return my files and the lack of communication from Secure Data.  On September 16, two days after the recovery was \u201ccomplete\u201d, I got the following email message from Eric: \u201cAlso, if I were to send you over a link to our Secure Data Recovery review page would you mind posting about my customer service? We have a little contest in the office and if I finish in the top 3 for the month the company will treat my kids, wife and I to dinner. Please let me know and I will send you the link.\u201d  As you might imagine, I didn\u2019t ask him for the link. Based on my very disappointing experience, I would not recommend this company."

          "Titre": "Be Warned: Horrible Experience and Nothing Recovered",
          "Contenu": "In November I experienced a catastrophic hard drive failure, and spoke to Jonathan Nguyen at Secure Data Recovery Services.I sent in my hard drive for the diagnostics, paying the $295.00 for expedited analysis. I was told that there was physical damage, but that the data looked to be recoverable.After agreeing to expedited service (2-5 business days), and pre-authorizing the payment, everything started to go wrong. Getting information was painful, I had to constantly chase down the status of what was happening, and I kept being told the engineers were working on my drive.I didn't even receive standard turn around at 5-9 business days. They received my hard drive on Nov 8th, 2021.  I did not receive the \"recovered\" files back until Thursday Dec 2nd, 2021. 26 days total until I received back a new drive with the supposedly \"recovered files\".After finally receiving this drive nothing on it was accessible.  Every file I tried to open was corrupted, even the ones that were supposedly marked good.  Most of the files had garbage characters written in there that said \"Data Recover Labs ?????????\" written over and over again. 99% of the files were stripped from their file structure, renamed with numbers, and stuck in a folder by \"file type\". Most of my file types, like Adobe Illustrator and Adobe InDesign were gone. The Adobe Photoshop files were all corrupt and wouldn't open, same with the jpeg files. It's one thing to tell me that the files can't be recovered - it's another to pretend they can, and send me back a drive where none of my files can be opened.  I was extremely clear up front that these were graphics files, that I was a graphic artist, and these were my critical files.  These were all on a mac formatted drive and were large Adobe Photoshop, Adobe InDesign and Adobe Illustrator files primarily, with jpg and png also.  I told the company that average files sizes were 50MB to 300mb and made it clear these were business files, not a hard drive full of personal mementos.Not only did I receive things back in a \"file type recovery\" format where all file structure was stripped, but it renamed every file so I had no clue what it was.  That too could have been dealt with if a single one of these files would open. They do not.  Not one of the psd files, not one of the jpeg files.  My Adobe InDesign files that had a file extension of .indd are just flat missing.I'm beyond disappointed in how this was handled.  At any point they could have told me that they didn't have experience with these large graphics files, or that their software was going to destroy the files, or that they didn't have experience with mac files. They didn't even tell me that my drive had been re-shipped off to Chicago instead of Los Angeles, and couldn't even get the shipping back to me with the correct method. Instead I was strung along for almost a month, while my business suffered waiting to hear whether anything could be recovered or if it all had to be rebuilt from scratch.I reached out to the company again and told them I was willing to pay the $295 for the diagnostics, the cost of the new hard drive they sent back, and a reasonable $500 fee for the work they did to access the physical drive. But I cannot pay $3,752.37 for \"recovered files\" that can't be opened.  That is simply unacceptable, not to mention ethically reprehensible.After giving them another 12 days to get back to me and make this right, I once again heard nothing from them and have proceeded to file a dispute with my credit card company and the Better Business Bureau."

          "Contenu": "My name is Tavi Florian and I had a recent experience with the SDR company, which had been promising at the beginning, but turned to bitter disappointment in the end. And even to a robbing attempt from them!Now the whole story of facts:- I contacted them on e-mail, with a detailed description of my problematic hard drive, on which another recovery procedure had been done at a specialized firm in my home country, and my whishes about further recovery of files (mostly pictures) from an easy checkable listing provided by the first company (with the original file names and their structuring sorted in two groups: the valid ones and the corrupted). I also told them that in the present, the read heads are probably dead.- After a few days, my case was assigned to someone in the Ohio area, named Luke Marrali, who was saying to me (knowing all the facts) that they offer free diagnostic and the normal pricing range of 400 to 1800$, with the mention that it can be higher \u201cif certain variables exist\u201d. How much higher? He doesn\u2019t said.- Then I decided against my feeling, but in favour of the reviews, to send my hard drive at SDR. - After its arrival, I went through the procedure and I authorized just the diagnostic. Then, no more than 2 hours passed, and the result came back... which was saying that the engineers are confident that they can start a successful recovery procedure. But they did not estimated any percentage of recoverable data, just that it can not be salvaged all the data because of some bad sectors. The price was about 3215$! For something very ambiguous. - Before the completion of pre-payment agreement, I gotten quickly out of there, asking the same guy for clarifications. It is unbelievable that they do not commit to anything! They won\u2019t show you the listing of salvaged data in order to let you decide if the operation is successful or not, if you are pleased with the results! And only if you accept the results, then you should have to pay for the needed data! This way seems logical and right for me. But NO, they decide instead of you!! They are like the banks... they never take risks, never lose anything. That is why they claim such a high rate of success (96%)! What a dump head would accept to buy the same data that he already have, for a price of 26 times more expensive?!! Unbelievable policy, in contradiction with the doubled price just because another recovery had been done. Ok, high price, but show me the data and let me decide if it is satisfactory or not. - That Luke guy had become very elliptical, throwing just a few words on you. Then given their lack of commitment, I refused any further continuation and was asking for my hard back. Now, it came the stroke of this crook! I almost felt his perfidious smile on his face... saying: \u201cUnfortunately this is an AS-IS case. You will be liable for payment either way.\u201d - FOR WHAT, YOU CHARLATAN, WANT MONEY FROM ME?! But this type crooks never even think about the condition of their potential victims! Referring now on by background, I have to say that I was an autistic child. And now, at 40 years old, I am alone, with no job and no friends... and probably I will remain this way for ever. I never had a girlfriend in my life. And for this matter, by the way, my most important lost photo (which I wanted the most to be recovered) was a girl on the street. Unfortunately, only after this hard drive disaster I realized how much I love her... and I wanted dearly to have that picture of her to put it on my chest when the time will come. Of course... an illusory love.- The next day, I wrote to him again, repeating all my arguments. Then, with a bit of delay, he threw a reply with the \u201cshipping fee\u201d of 49$. This fee still looked high for me, thinking of that paying threat from Luke. And knowing the price I had paid to send it, about 19.3$.- I was also looking for a second opinion on my case, in the SDR company, writing them on facebook. Fortunately, their person on FB was nicer and I manage to communicate better with him. He made a checking in the shipping department and confirmed me the shipping fee was correct. Which was actually much smaller for companies than for a normal person. - Ok, That should be it and I paid, getting a clear invoice of 49$ for the shipping to my address in eastern Europe.- After a few quiet days, the real shock came... that Luke specimen saying the following words: \u201cReturn shipping quoted is actually $195.00 instead of $49. We cannot honor the $49.00 charge and you will have to pay the difference. We can always shred the drive for free or we can invoice you the difference.\u201c In the previous days, it just seemed that they had given up to charge me for the \u201cAS-IS case\u201d.From time to time, big companies might do charitable acts, but for this kind of scumbags it is a huge challenge just to respect the deal, to be FAIR and have clear fees! The \u201ccharitable act\u201d of rightness was a huge challenge for that specimen! He failed! Again me on facebook and manage to sorted out on Friday (without knowing for sure)... and finally, on Tuesday next (this) week my hard came back to me surprisingly, a surprise on the good side this time, without any sending confirmation from them. - Finally, such a waste of time, energy, hopes and money! But I still keep a minimal hope.IN CONCLUSION:1. I got fooled by the good reviews, BIG TIME! Wanting to be optimistic and see only the good parts.2. With this SDR company, there is no phrase like this: \u201cwe bring your data where others have failed\u201d. A long review, but the experience was shocking for me, in relation with the size of this company and its public quotation."

After expressing my concern the estimate was lowered by almost half. Ultimately i took it to a local computer repair shop who retrieved all my data for $75.My biggest complaints are that SDR is slow to respond, not proactive, unorganized, and their pricing seems to take advantage (hijacking emergency situations). If there is a positive it is that their staff are very friendly."

          "Contenu": "Sure, they recovered almost all the data I have lost, and that's practically really all I wanted from them. However, there are several points that should be improved during the process.1. Their customer account portal. This is very nice, but needs some improvements. Once you chose the turnaround time from several estimates, the customer account portal will NEVER show you which turnaround time you chose. I actually felt they had slightly passed the estimated time of completion of data recovery, but as the turnaround time is NEVER shown either in the portal nor in any email notification, I could not claim my right to any discount due to their (not sure, as I cannot confirm anywhere, but possible) delay in their process.  I think I ordered an expedited (2-4 days?) plan, but it took them a week (5 days) to complete the process. This is an issue related to the expensive price--customers surely pay a lot; let them know exactly the correct information about the price and time.2. Many reviews here write that they are responsive. I cannot believe it. I requested for updates through customer portal several times, as I felt the process was behind the promised turnaround time, which was due to the issue 1 mentioned above, but they replied only once, which was from a technician and was indeed relieving. It is okay, I know you are busy, and all I want from you is data recovery, period. But if you cannot reply to update requests, it might be better to delete that function in the customer portal. Also, the customer service representative responded to my multiple email questions only once during the process and ignored all the remaining questions. It is, again, okay, as I was clearly in a panic or too worried and most of my questions probably looked stupid to them; data recovery is most important, and the remainder is, after all, nothing. Still, this lack of responsiveness was enough to make me wonder about the quality of the customer service itself. Overall, extremely frustrating and not worth the extravagantly expensive price. I posted this review on Google, but somehow it does not show up on Google Reviews. Most of the reviews on Google are written by those with only one review."

So for data recovery services, it's 4 or 5 stars.The problem is that the level of customer service I received was pretty terrible for something costing $1,000.  I had follow-up questions about what could be the possible reasons why my hard drive failed, and if there might be anything I could do to prevent this from happening again.  After I agreed to pay the $1,000, Secure Data never responded to another email I sent.  Nothing.  I had questions, I got no answers, and not even a response.  Secure Data absolutely can recover your files, but at a very high price point, and don't expect any answers to your questions, or any responses at all.

Thank you so much to Kyle for being on point to get this done. A suggestion for improvement if I may, from my technical support experience at a Regional Asia Pacific Helpdesk for Kearney ($1.4billion 2019 revenue)? A ticketing management software tool to make sure nothing falls through the cracks. It should have features that may include, but not limited to: point-of-contact info, SLA (Service Level Agreements) management, start-to-end resolution status. Good luck!

It would only mount in another computer about one out of every 5 or 6 tries... and then it would ask for the bitlocker key.  After putting it in it would only run for a few minutes and then unmount, so I couldn't get much data off at all.  Then, at one point I tried putting in the key and it told me the key was invalid... but I knew it was the right key.  I think the sectors that held the key on the disk probably got corrupted... I couldn't do anything else, so I sent it so Secure Data Recovery.  \r They ran in to the same issue with the bitlocker key being incorrect... but on a whim I pulled up an OLD bitlocker key from well over a year ago... and apparently that worked!  I have no idea how.  But needless to say, they were able to recover all the data, so it was a success.\r The only improvement I could suggest is that it took quite some time, and updates on the status were not always forthcoming unless requested.  It ended up taking quite a while to get the data back to me, in part because I had to send out a separate hard drive for the recovery to a part of their business in another state... a few weeks, ultimately."

He patiently led me through a lot of issues and questions, and I have a feeling I shall be calling back. In terms of suggestions for possible improvement, I think it would be helpful going in to let people know a bit more of what the prices are--I was initially told the baseline fee was $400, so when I found out that the minimum fee I would be paying was over $1,400, there was a bit of a shock. It was absolutely worth it, but a lot of people do not have the means to pay such a high price, and, if they know that going in, they may be better equipped to gauge the value of their data versus the price point. Lastly, and this just may be my issue, but the files are not easily found on the external hard drive. I know that there are 'folders inside of folders inside of folders,' but, after an admittedly quick and cursory examination, I still can't find my files without entering a specific file name. I believe it is going to require a LOT more digging, which I simply do not have the time for right now. Nonetheless, the peace of mind that has been achieved in knowing that ALL my data was recovered is immense, and I cannot thank you enough for the professional and expedient manner in which you handled my case. Special kudos to Eli!"

The last time I had to do this was a few years back, but was not impressed with that firm, so I found Secure Data Recovery. The response from the personnel was very good, with quick turn-around time to all communications, and helpful information. They were able to recover all the data, and in a reasonably good timeframe. I had no rush for the data recovery, so I wasn't too concerned about that. The price was average, though -- about the same as other services I've used. One drawback was that Secure Data Recovery did not provide a recovery drive at cost, or even at retail prices. The base service is data recovery and you provide your own recovery drive. Secure Data Recovery will provide a recovery drive, but at significantly more cost than if you get a replacement drive and ship it to them, which is what I did. The reason for the additional cost for a higher-tier recovery plan, according to their website, is because, in addition to the replacement drive, there were additional \"services\". However, none of the extra \"services\" had any value to me at all. So that just made the cost of the drive way too much. But I did ship a replacement drive to them and they transferred the data to it and have shipped it back. So I'd come back if I need to do this again."

The original phone had tea spilled on it and it ruined the screen so that I could no longer utilize the phone, but I could tell it was still working since it was making noises. I took the computer components out and attempted to transfer to another phone with a working screen so that I could access and save my data, however that didn't work. So I searched and found Secure Data Recovery. I requested a quote, and my customer service rep, Kurt Pietrick, called and discussed what I wanted. He kept in contact with me and answered questions as I had them throughout the process. I selected the standard service and turn around was less than a month. It was more expensive than I was anticipating, approx $1200, but it was worth it to me as I had years of pictures and videos stored that i had never backed up. A few of the video files where corrupt and I couldn't view them, but overall it was a success! The only downside is that when your data is returned it is on a drive that is accessible only after you download their APP, I typically don't use APPs, so I would have preferred it to be just a password protected drive, but even following the instructions to open the drive was easy. I would use again and suggest to others."

          "Contenu": "Thank goodness for Secure Data Recovery! I had a major hard disk crash on my laptop late last year. I was beside myself when my photos from the past four years, as well as other important files, could not be salvaged by my local big-box store tech support. Worse yet, I had not properly backed up anything. Fortunately, I found Secure Data Recovery and eventually got my damaged hard disk out to them in California. I am comfortable with tech stuff to a point, but the account manager handling my case answered all of my questions and concerns and made the process easy, and he was available to answer other questions as they arose. We had a slight glitch when I was emailed someone else's recovery report, but the account manager straightened it out and the process continued smoothly. On my end, the only thing I would have changed would be to eliminate the drop-off aspect of the process and mail the disk directly. In retrospect, I instinctively knew how to properly package the damaged drive for mailing off to Secure Data Recovery and probably would have saved myself a 45-minute drive to the suggested drop-off location. Otherwise, Secure Data Recovery saved my photos and files, all within their estimated project time. I even got telephone assistance with the encrypted hard drive containing my recovered files. Secure Data Recovery is not inexpensive, but for me, the price was worth it because had I not used their services, I would have lost a considerable chunk of precious photo memories. They do offer a few pricing options for dealing with a technical problem, so that was quite helpful. Thanks to everyone at Secure Data Recovery for your technical expertise, courteous service, and truth in advertising. Hopefully, I will not go through a hard disk crash again (ever), but if I do, I know who I'm going to call."

Frederick Wright kept me up to date on the status of my hard drive recovery. I explained to Dr. Wright that I''m currently on night shift, he was very understanding and kept me informed by through email and still made me feel like I was his only customer.Out of 50k+ files, they were only unable to recover four and they provided me the names of those files. Even the return shipping through FedEx was frustration free (I typically have problems with FedEx when a signature is required).I knocked off half a star due to the way the recovered data was provided to me. Because the cable for the secure hard drive was short, I used my usb extender. The drive would unlock for about fifteen seconds and would not show up in the file manager, then would re-lock. After about thirty minutes and me starting to get frustrated, I plugged the drive directly into the computer and had no further issues. I have been unable to get the app that unlocks the drive to work without allowing access to and enabling my location. Now that I have all my data back on my computer, I will be wiping the secure drive and it will became a rather expensive paper weight. The recovered data did include some financial information that I am very happy to have back, and I''m glad that the data was secured so that that if something happened during shipping, I''m protected. Now that being said, I am sure that if I had spoken with Dr. Wright on the phone, the whole issue would probably have not existed.In summary, awesome customer service, I would use them again, but I would discuss how the data was returned a little more."

          "Contenu": "I absolutely cannot say enough wonderful things about Secure Data Recovery!  Being a photographer, sports and all, not to mention my very own priceless memories, I was completely stressing when my external hard drive decided to go berserk.  My clients rely on me to deliver their images quickly and having reliable storage is a priority.  From a business standpoint, image recovery was a necessity.  From the get-go, my questions were answered and the process was explained thoroughly.  I was able to send my WD Passport quickly and received a diagnostic update within a couple days.  Mind you, shipping and allowing the experts to diagnose my hard drive was free--no harm in trying!  Elliot Fisher provided outstanding service.  He understood my dilemma and the apprehension that tagged along.  He kept communication open; answering emails/calls in a timely manner, and never hesitating to call me directly with updates.  The entire process was very professional--contracts to keep you covered.  After the process had begun and I was updated with my recovery status, I was one hundred percent at ease with the entire situation.  I actually thought, this is gonna be okay--whew!  Secure Data Recovery retrieved my images from my failed hard drive, approximately 1.7tbs.  Talk about relief!  I cannot thank Secure Data Recovery enough.To all my fellow photographers out there, in South Carolina and elsewhere, Secure Data Recovery is a lifesaver.Jessica CarpenterLMLDSouth Carolina"

THANK YOU!  I am a sole practitioner lawyer.  Ironically, I was in the process of \"cleaning\" my database in preparation for an upgrade to a cloud-based case management program when my computer CRASHED!  I was downright distraught! An IT friend told me about data recovery providers and I found SDR.  They were so informing, professional, responsive, and recovered ALL of my data (as far as I can tell)!  They were almost twice as expensive as the other companies I checked with, but their excellent handling of my case from the get-go caused me to think they would handle the data recovery as well.  I am so grateful for their excellent work!by  \"Relieved in Rancho\""

Ouch! Unfortunately, as a college student and funding my own research, of course my college wouldn\u2019t have any access to data recovery and certainly wouldn\u2019t help for the cost.As panicked as I was, I found contact with Randall at this business and they walked me through the steps. I was skeptical at times because of all the conflicting things I\u2019d read about data recovery. However, they answered all of my questions. They worked with me to figure out the best method for the issue my hard drive was having, and they were very accommodating.Now I know better. I\u2019ll make sure to replace my HDDs every few years. A very expensive mistake, but we are one step closer to figuring out how to treat ALS! =) If ever this issue is to happen again, I won\u2019t hesitate to go back to this company."

His data was not backed up which meant that his was at risk of losing six months of critical research work. I reached out to Secure Data Recovery Services based on Google reviews. They were extremely professional from the get-go. Jacob Medina was the dedicated representative assigned to me. Whatever I can say about Jacob would not be enough. Jacob was very patient with me (inspire of me being a \"pest\") explaining me the data recovery process and the status of my data recovery. He very well understood how nervous I was about the outcome, but he kept me well informed at every stage. If there is any example of going \"above and beyond\" customer service, its Jacob. He shared his direct line as well as his cell number. He spoke to my son directly and helped him get his data back. Words cannot express my gratitude for Jacob.If you ever have a data recovery situation, I will highly recommend Secure Data Recovery Services and although I am sure everyone is an all-star there I would ask for Jacob if possible!!Way to go Secure Data Recovery Services you have set the bar very high for customer service. You're the best in business!"

All three times were servers, two times were raid 5 with SQL data and the other time was an SSD with VMs. The data on these drives is the lifeblood of my clients.There's quite a bit of tension in the air with my clients during that time. Going through IVR hell or waiting for emails just add to everyone's frustration. From the first call, through the stages of discovery and ultimately retrieval, Scott was always available by phone and email and expeditiously and accurately answered any questions and concerns my client had.Secure data did manage to retrieve all data necessary to help me rebuild three clients data infrastructure. When the first failure happened a few years ago, I called a few different places. Secure data was one of them. I knew I wasn't going to get a second chance with the data or this client(or my reputation). My gut instinct(and 20 years working with IT vendors) told me to go with Secure Data and I'm glad I did."

I though it was just a corrupted header and attempted to manually access it myself, but no success.I contacted Jonathan N. at Secure Data and explained what I believed was wrong.  He asked specific questions regarding the drive which I answered.  Thankfully, he did not seem to be patronizing as some tech support agents are when asking questions and questioning my responses.  He was brief, professional and seemed to be understanding.When I asked him approximately how much it would cost, he did dance around a bit, saying it depended on the drive, the symptoms and the underlying cause.  He provided an email w/ a link to their web page and their available recovery packages, terms & conditions as well as pricing for the recovery packages.  While I did not expect low prices, I wasn't quite prepared for the actual prices.  To be fair, they did have an option to decline service after diagnosing for \"S&H fee\", of $28.00; small price to pay to know if your data is recoverable or not, esp if you decide to decline the service.Successful data recovery, excellent tech support & customer service.  Would definitely use service again if needed."
