I recommend you not to contact this store, they will waste your time and ask for your details for nothing. Their approach to business is repulsive and outrageous.Their 1 st reply:We greatly appreciate your assistance in helping us maintain a secure environment against fraud for both you and our shop. Now that we're all secure, we're excited to tell you that your order is on its way and will be shipped out ASAP!And after:Order #2360 was canceled because of unforeseen circumstances and your payment has been voided.Why you Answer me order will be shipped out and after it cancel?

I honestly believe maxandfix(Dominic) are working together and screwing over their customers."

I already trusted their work. I felt assured about my experience and what I was getting. I've been getting consistency, and apparently, so was that other guy. The Apple knowledge is thorough. There isn't a question I couldn't get answered or information I should have known that I didn't get. Lastly, the work Ive been doing in rebuilding my credit means I've been trying to avoid any inquires to keep my points from dropping. I couldn't shed that much cash at once, and I needed a finance option that didn't include running or placing an extra inquiry on my credit. The program they offered me did exactly that with a small deposit and payment installments drawn from my account. Amazing, and exactly what I neededGracias, Besitos!!-Fifty"
