          "Contenu": "They came on time which was pretty good considering where they were being shipped from. BUT.... As soon I as I open the very first one which was the (strawberry flavor) was disappointed. After 2 hits it got super hott, then started blinking as if were already dying. It got super hot and stayed thar way for a long time, I thought it was gonna blow up for realz. It was just an all bad experience for me because this is my absolute favorite brand of vape and I can't find anyone selling them in or around where I live, so I was very excited to finally get them. But the excitement was just as quickly turned in to disappointing. I'm a lil scared to open the others in fear that I not only my hopes up but also wasted my money aswell."

It used to be 2 days to my house from you now it is taking a week. The package is sitting at your place with just the label created for about 2 days before it even leaves to USPS. Then after it leaves tracking never updates. Also I have asked EVERY SINGLE TIME to have my items shipped in a box to prevent damage and you never comply. So frustrating."

          "Contenu": "I've been using ecigmafia for a couple years now and in the beginning I had a disposable device not work correctly and when I reached out to customer service they asked I send a video of the device malfunctioning which I did and they credited my account. Sometime later I had opened a device to find the inside of the bag it came in soaked in ejuice and the device was DOA. I emailed support and they gave me push back saying they aren't reaponsible for the product they sell and the device manufacturer is at fault and I would need to take it up with them. BUT they offered to do me a HUGE favor and repace the device after I paid for shipping and send the defective device back to then. I told them I would just eat the cost this time, attempting to be gracious. They ignored my response appearing less than grateful for my being reasonable or loyal. Since then I have had four more deivices I've had to throw in the trash as they arrived as described above. I haven't even bothered to deal with ecigmafia's cheapskate customer service. Spend hundreds on their site but then basically be accused of trying to commit fraud if I get a bad device and expect them to back up what they sell. I'll be seeing if there is a different vendor that values my patronage next time I shell out for 20+ devices per order. I'm disgusted with companies dodging resposibility and nickel and diming a person at every opportunity."

          "Contenu": "So I made an order Monday and tracked it and it's Saturday and still haven't received it. I've had a friend order multiple times from there and the previous order was done Sunday evening and was received Thursday. While tracking this order for one thing it sat at 1 post office for 3-4 days and today it finally showed up in Denver at 4:13am, yet somehow I still didn't receive it today. I know to cover yourselves you say it can be a week, but you're shipping 2-3 day Priority mail. Mail even delivers on Saturday. 5-6 shipping days and I still don't even know if I'll get it by next week. I'm not saying it's crazy for something to take 7 or more days, but I've order from other places before and if you order Monday you're definitely getting it by Friday. Considering you sent me this email a couple days ago asking to review my purchase. I assume it means you think I should have received the product by now to review it right? Pretty tough to do a review when I haven't received the product. I learned my lesson and most likely will try a site with more reliable delivery times. Lesson learned."

          "Contenu": "Firstly their site is not very clear on all products, with not enough description. Their return policy says 30 days on their site, but the 2 times I've had to deal with customer service, they have denied a return request because the first time the agent told me they don't accept returns after 3 days, and the second agent told me they don't accept opened products in a return. Well I wouldn't have opened the second product if their website was clear in the first place and I would have ordered the correct part!! Instead of listing pods and atomizers separately, there's a selection menu on many pods and atomizers, and very little description about each one, so it's easy to get the wrong product if you're not very careful and know exactly what you need. Just a horrible experience."

Was scared it would blow up as hot as it got so I set it outdoors just in case. About an hr or so later it was dead. I'm an understanding person so I know things happen and as cheap as they were I can't really expect them to handle very much. Little disappointed because I may have to go to a town and pay 2-3 times as much as my whole order because neither will work.

So I initiated another return (within a week or 2 of receiving the order), and that refund status stayed open. Fast forward to today (months after last order) when I placed another order, I left a note saying I never received an update for that return and asked them to check on the return. I checked the status and it says canceled- granted this refund was requested months ago. The very least customer service could do was send an email telling me why they could not refund it- because they have communicated nothing to me regarding the refund or exchange I requested. So the customer service blows. It was only $13 but still..."

I called them on it and all they did was give me a store credit meaning I had to buy even more stuff. So, finally I do and they send me not 1 but 4 packages of the wrong coils. I sent them photos and the receipt immediately when I got the order. I called after two business days of hearing nothing. They apologized and said they wanted to make things right. They knew of the mistake on my black Friday order which was a large order. They made several promises then as well. It took till the New Year to come in before even a quarter of that was set right. My brother and some other friends had ordered from them for several years and my brother called and talked to someone about everything and sent him pictures from black Friday and this last order as well. We have voicemail and countless emails about all of the mistakes. He said he was going to send the correct Freemax Mesh Coils. Great here we go again.  We were supposed to receive what we ordered 4 three coil packages of Freemax Double Mesh Coils 0.2ohm.. Instead we got three packages of0. 15 quad coils. None of us use that kind of wattage. Bottom line we were out well over $100.00 from black Friday and now instead of getting our 4 packages of 3 coils we got three of the wrong style and ohms and one completely empty. To make up for the Black Friday nightmare we were promised either 2 VooPoo Drag 2 Mod starter kits or two Vaporesso Gen Mod Devices. We haven't gotten our correct coils and since Black Friday No VooPoo Drag 2 kits both Ink or the Vaporesso Gen Mod Devices in Gold, black or silver. Not Kool, not professional and lied to over and over again."

There was nothing they could do about it.  I guess if you buy multiple vapes you should open them all as soon as you get them to make sure they work...to stay within the guidlines of the rules...my bad..i just expected to get a better quality and service from a big store like Ecigmafia...but i guess i shouldnt trust that either..wont happen again..."

From what I've seen, that means that Monday-Wednesday they are backed up on orders trying to fulfill them, and won't send your order from Friday-Monday out until at least Tuesday. Then, I live in Maryland, they are in Georgia, but for some reason every single time they ship my order to a Florida distribution center first, which is almost further away from Atlanta than my address. They basically send it in the exact opposite direction first, where I watch it sit for days sometimes. In general, it takes about 6-7 days to get my order, after being charged $9 to ship a $25 order. It's outrageous, I did not find the support helpful when I sent a ticket, and I think that this company needs to fix its shipping methods because they charge too much to give me too little and by the time my nicotine comes it's 3-4 days over the expected arrival time. Not okay considering the proximity of this company and how much they charge to ship."

Holds a charge well and taste is good. Makes a funny \"buzzing\" sound right after a full charge for a little while, a sound I have not heard with my other vapes, but I don't believe it is a malfunction since it went away as the charge lowered over time.As far as the customer service, not happy. While I made the mistake of being in a hurry purchasing the vape, what caught my eye was the \"Buy one get one free\" so I purchased with coils and another pod but missed the little note stating, \"Add 2 To Your Cart & One Will Be Free at Checkout\". Long story short, only one arrived and when I contacted ECigMafia, I was basically told too bad since it shipped and all they could do was half refund or credit?! Seems to me as a repeat customer the customer service could have worked with me and sent the other even if I paid the shipping. Saving a couple bucks instead of making good on an advertisement to your customers would seem to be a smarter move as opposed to losing a customer."

Before you could check the progress of your delivery on the Route website though it was very heavily trying to get you to use their app. Now they only have the option to to see where my package is at by downloading the app. It claims that it'll track all sorts of other companies packages but I order stuff online all the time from many different places and I've never came across any other company that uses it. I refuse to download yet another app that will most definitely gather all the information it can to sell to the highest bidder and make a profit that I'll only use a few times at most in a year, and I already had to pay a nominal fee to have it in the first place. Delivery of packages bought from a company already have federal guidelines that the onus is on the company that the goods be delivered to the purchaser in the United States so the added \"insurance\" is absolutely unnecessary and loosing the tracking feature without downloading the app is just 100% a free money grab that offers nothing of value to me anymore so I won't be purchasing the Route package insurance anymore. Other than that, ECigMafia has always provided great service and awesome prices, especially with the discount codes that they almost always have going, so I'll definitely continue to order from them in the future."

          "Contenu": "Initially I gave E-CigMafia a 1-star review because their delivery took much longer than expected. It's possible it was a one time occurrence and I will order from them again to see if that was the case. As far as the products received, website, and overall experience (pricing, products, etc.) I would give it 4-stars. My only reason for not giving it 5-stars is because while their pricing is great on disposables, majority of the time on the best deals they're either completely sold out or have 1 or 2 flavors that most people don't want. So a lot of times the really great deals are unavailable. But comparison pricing with BOGO specials on high end products is still very good and I'm happy with the products. I will definitely warn anyone about buying the cheap disposables that are -$5-10 and have a BOGO deal....they are trash \ud83d\uddd1. Like anything else you get what you pay for. I bought almost 40 cheap disposables foe the same price as 11 high end ones and I ended up tossing most of the cheap ones because of taste and the next day they gave you a sore throat....most likely I was paying money to allow China to slowly poison me."

I normally get the same flavors in the salt nic \"Fruit Monster\" brand as well as the \"Milk\" Cinnamon and Jax. I order all of my months worth of products and supplies on the 3rd if each month and time it so everything we ill last and was very disappointed that none of my normal juices were in stock!"

Have not had any issues with shipping times or products. I like that they have a rewards program and coupon codes. Shipping is probably the cheapest around. The only reason I do not give 5 stars, and this is NOT just Ecigmafia, it goes for all three of the online shops that I have ordered from...they will only post positive reviews on items. If you leave a bad review on an item it will not go up on the website. Not sure if this is the company or they are outsourcing their reviews to someone else but it's a very shady practice and should be illegal. I quit leaving reviews on products because what's the point? Customers are being mislead."

Fast shipping, great quality, and is my new official online site that I will be ordering from for now on. Thank you so much for actually having the rebuildable mesh set up.

NOBODY has cheaper shipping or prices. Their selection could always use more but who's couldn't? One thing I notice is because of this their juice is almost always fresh which is another real big problem of many juice stores. A lot of stores sold out to the gov pressures that came with the Priority Mail price hikes and passed the tax onto the vapers but honestly these guys are one of the only ones who didn't.

Remember when the USPS started that ruckus about shipping e-cig products? Some other shops were sending your order by courier, requiring signature. Yes, requiring signature! What? Honestly, who stays home and waits for a package these days?I started out buying e-juices and coils. I pretty much buy everything here now. My e-juice was out of stock for a long, long, time. But in all fairness, everyone else was out of it too. But it's back now! No! I will not share it with you! Then everyone will buy it and it will go out of stock again!! Just kidding \ud83d\ude02 Vapetasia Killer Kustard. It's like a dessert, but not too overwhelmingly sweet. (I don't get out much!)Oh, and coupons! We love the coupons!Keep on doing what you're doing EcigMafia. You're like a well oiled machine. And very, very, appreciated. Thank you!Wishing You & Yours a Beautiful and Blessed Holiday Season \u2764\ufe0f"
