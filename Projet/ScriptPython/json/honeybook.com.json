          "Contenu": "HoneyBook won\u2019t let you send an invoice or contract without attaching their payment system which charges you 3%. They design it in a way that they make sure they get their 3% when all a customer has to do is send an e-transfer, which is typically free. This also applies for a full paid account - so they\u2019re already getting paid.When asked to disable it they just repeat themselves over and over again and make it sound like they are doing you a favour. The customer should have a choice in how their client pays. I told the customer service rep that by repeating themselves over and over again is not good customer service. Just another example of a greedy corporation taking advantage of a small business trying to keep expenses low to provide the best service to clients!"

It is also confusing how to create a following invoice. Template management is not optimal. And to be honest, I had to explain to clients that the email they received from HB is from us and that they need to click on the link at the bottom of the message to open the contract, sign and pay. It actually causes delays and more work for me. For what it does, I think it is also quite pricey: $18/month plus for every payment that comes through 2.9% + $0.25. That fee should be a capped amount like banks do. That alone drives me looking around for other solutions. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate paying for convenience, but this calculation makes the platform really costly over time. It's a hidden payment you probably don't think about at first."

This is still a problem despite saying its a feature that is coming for years.  New builder for proposals is awful and clunky feels very limiting. Really don't like the new branding either but that has nothing to do with the functionality."

I am only taking the time to write this review because I have been a honeybook user for many years (six I think!), and have recommended HB to a lot of friends and colleagues. But there are feature requests we have been asking for for years that have been completely ignored - in favor of creating things that people are not asking for (the failure of the \"opportunities\" feature comes to mind right away). I also was so excited to use smart files and thought they would save so much time, but those have been a disappointment as well and I had to immediately switch back to legacy files.There are also lots of things that are clunky or straight up do not work (like read receipts not working, or inquiry replies going to spam). Lastly, the way the HB team manages the HB users facebook group is an embarrassment. Either comments are completely stifled by not being posted at all, or if something negative/constructive is allowed through, HB is quick to switch off commenting. To me, it seems like HB is more concerned with attracting new users than keeping the ones they have."

          "Contenu": "So far I love Honeybook. It's got an excellent workflow system in place and helps you out a ton. It keeps you super organized, on top of all of your projects, and really helps you create contracts, invoices, questionnaires, testemonial requests, you name it!Ok now what it lacks-the reason I give them 3 stars, is their payment system. They charge you a 3% FEE on every payment given by your clients. Now, I'm a wedding photographer. You do the math, but taking 3% of a $2500 wedding photography charge-is a good chunk of change. One that I'm not ever allowing my clients to use again. So until they change that, and either drop the fee to 1% like every other payment platform out there (Paypal, Venmo), or integrate those other payment transfer companies onto their app and website-it'll be a 3 star rating for me. My recommendation for anyone wanting to invest in Honeybook-DO IT! It's a great company, but just tell your clients to only pay you cash, or through venmo and paypal. Don't make the same mistake as me and lose almost $100 on a deposit for a wedding because I was unaware of their ridiculous fee."

I'll always be promoting and using the platform. With that said, I don't love the direction the company has gone this year. I feel like there's a lot of effort being put into new features or avenues with the system when the current features we have don't even work the way they should all the time. There's data linking that has dead ends, glitches happening constantly, so many issues with the scheduler, and basic things we should be able to change in system settings that cause a lot of manual work. I would much prefer to see the team fine tuning what is already there instead of trying to add new things like banking or changing branding that didn't need to be changed. The customer service team has gone so far downhill this year. Wait times are insane, it's taken me days to solve problems sometimes and usually it's me following up with them a ton to get a response before anything is done. It seems like there's a lot of focus on growth and the team is loosing sight on the details that brought people into the platform in the first place. Again, I'm not going anywhere. I LOVE HB. But I am disappointed to see how things have gone this year. I do know things are changing, and I am aware a lot of hard work is being put in which I really appreciate so I have hope this is just a bump in the road that we will soon see smoothed out."

          "Contenu": "HoneyBook is a great solution for an entry-level service provider. In many ways, it's the perfect all-in-one tool with excellent customization of your proposals, invoices, client questionnaires, and more. I've also found customer service to be very responsive. (Although I recently found out I'm on a legacy plan that includes priority customer service. I have no idea what it's like for others on the newer version of my plan.)That said, there are some real limitations that keep it from being as wonderful as it could be. A lot of the UX is clunky and confusing. One example: I still cannot get the order of operations right in my brain that when I want to send an email to a client that contains a file, I can't just choose an email template and then create/add the file. I have to create the file first, then select the email template. Sounds basic, right? It is. But that's what UX is for\u2014being intuitive. Also, navigation back to the main menu sucks when you're inside a project file. Basic stuff.I also have no use for the automations, because I need different things to happen for different offers, and there's no customization for the triggers. (Why does HoneyBook allow you to have multiple forms, yet when you select a form trigger for an automation, there's no way to specify WHICH form triggers the action?) I've worked with some other systems in the past that had really robust automations, triggers, and rules. There's so much potential, but right now, this feature is of no use to me.I'm hopeful that changes are in the works, because while I've considered switching to Dubsado, I know that would come with its own set of challenges and drawbacks. I'd love to know what's ahead on HB's roadmap of feature updates. That would help people like me who need more out of the tool to stay on board."

          "Contenu": "I came to HoneyBook from Dubsado after 2 years. One of the main factors that lead me to this was the additional cost I was paying for my alias companies. The standard fee is about the same now (even though 2 years ago Dubsado was much cheaper). The second factor was the HoneyBook app. I am an avid user of mobile devices and having an integrated app if for nothing but invoicing, contract signing, or responding to inquiries is a lifesaver.After using HoneyBook for a few months I'm definitely becoming familiar with what it is lacking. First and foremost is the payment system. Not being able to integrate Paypal or any other ecomm platform sucks. Not being able to access funds immediately if necessary is a bummer and so is HoneyBook's added processing fee. In addition, the UI while very intuitive and sleek is lacking a lot of personalization options that I miss with Dubsado. For example, being able to create interactive order forms with user-defined is EXTREMELY MISSED. I like being able to give the customer the choice of choosing their own package and having it auto process to my invoice and workflow. Or just sending BASIC forms with images within the project flow, this would at least allow me to send drafts for approval. WHYYYY would that not be included in a system catering to the creative industry????Workflow on HoneyBook is something I have not had much time to figure out. It doesn't appear as if I can send custom payment confirmation emails which would make workflow completely useless to me. Again, I have not dived that deep into Workflow as of yet. With email communication being an integral part of my business, not being able to send client emails from my personal webmail address is just ridiculous! HoneyBook really drops the ball in enabling paying customers to customize and personalize their CMS system and they really brand the hell out of it.Unfortunately, there are other smaller issues like not having the Time Tracker on the app, not being able to send estimates vs. invoices, not having an integrated booking system (I believe you need a third-party service). And more! These are extreme trade off's for the ease-of-use and intuitive system that HoneyBook does provide. Once my promotion period ends, I will have a SERIOUS decision to make on moving forward with HoneyBook."

The limited apps for mobile compared to desktop is frustrating but I understand it takes time. I just don't understand why basic features are still not adapted in the year and a half I've used HB. The inability to shut off auto-pay for my client (I've had three who I had to send \"how to\" guides because they don't understand why they have to turn it off) is annoying. The calendar could definitely be improved, I used to use setmore and it was great it just made it too complicated to use both as then I'm getting emails through two services and I need something streamline I don't have to pay so much extra for. HB is STILL the way to go as I've tried lots of other programs, but it is still a work in progress. I look forward to new features as things progress!"

          "Contenu": "Update (01/11/23)A person from the Honeybook team directly reached out to me, and having her as my advocate helped me feel at ease. I decided to move all of my payments to Stripe instead of using Honeybook for payment processing and sending invoices and that made a world of difference. I have stayed with Honeybook as a customer since then, and everything else has been running so much more smoothly now that I have made the decision to have my payments processed elsewhere.Of course, I would love to have Honeybook be everything for my business - but with all it has to offer, I still find the value incredible. Updating my rating from two stars to four now!-(5/25/2022) Honeybook was a dream come true at first. Having an \"all in one\" place for contracts, payment, scheduling, and project management was seriously such a relief as a one person small business.Now I write this review not to discredit the good, because when it works it works so well. But when you have issues? It's a nightmare. The Support Team, while well meaning, take hours to respond and I would not mind that IF I left those conversations with a solution in hand. I have had two autopay payments fall through the cracks and have had to email my clients back and forth for two weeks because they can't seem to tell me what the issue is. They just respond saying \"tell them to click pay\" which I have done THREE times now over the last two weeks. Now, I have a frustrated client that is ready to leave my business which is $4,000 that I am losing because of this issue. Now, I have another issue where another client's autopay is skipping a month and I would not have noticed and have lost that money, too if the clients didn't mention it to me!This is unacceptable and I am sad to say I will be cancelling my membership with Honeybook. Additionally, the fact that collecting payments and setting up autopay is incredibly difficult with their smart files and I have to restart the whole file IF I were to re-send an invoice and have to have clients do the same thing again: sign the contracts and input their payment details AGAIN for the fourth time is making my life as a small business owner difficult.I have lost time, money, and energy with Honeybook which is the antithesis of what their product is supposed to do for me as a small business owner.I really do hope they improve. In theory, the product is amazing. When it works it works, like I said. When it doesn't? You're on your own, left with very little help, and zero solutions."

Honeybook swept in and Marie Kondo-ed the shiz out of my business. Now, my Client Management system brings me so, so much joy. It's simple. It's streamlined. It looks good. It would probably smell nice if that was possible. Honestly, if Honeybook had an unattached humanoid brother, I would totally swipe right because these genetics are obviously good. So, thanks Honeybook. Not only did you design a beautiful system that allows both long-time professionals and newbies to get their business game right, but I would hazard to say that y'all have probably prevented a fair amount of nervous breakdowns amongst entrepreneurs. Personally, I can think of at least a half dozen late-night frustration cries your gorgeous software saved me from...who knew you were also a #mentalhealth and #selfcare company?Also, do you have a brother?"
