          "Titre": "DON'T use ID Shield",
          "Contenu": "We chose to pay for the legal \"benefit\" through my husband's employer, and our 22 year old daughter needed to file bankruptcy, so she paid ID Shield $1400 and Jeff didn't even help her understand that loans with a cosigner won't be forgiven- they'll just become the sole responsibility of the other party. That loan was the ONLY reason she filed, and all Jeff can say is, \"uh, sorry.\" The paperwork asks about co-debters, but she didn't know what that meant, and he didn't walk her through it, or take the time to explain or describe anything to her. If a bankruptcy lawyer asks even ONE question, he/she should ask if the loan the client wants forgiven is in anyone else's name. That would have been a very simple question for her to answer. She said that he had her on the phone for 2 minutes and he was in a big hurry to get her off the phone. He was negligent. He does this every day. Our daughter doesn't. He screwed her over. And we later learned of another firm that charges a flat fee of $749. So, she was swindled out of an extra $650, her credit is ruined for 10 years, and the debt she needed forgiven wasn't. DON'T use these guys. They're incompetent jerks."

Eventually, my case got forwarded on and I've apparently been forgotten altogether. Just about ready to cancel.  They've gone from Good to Horrible in under one year."

Over the years I subscribed, it never revealed any information I didn't already know.  Customer service is AWFUL.  I am writing this as I try to cancel the service.  Initial rep had to transfer me \"over there\" to cancel service, and I was on hold for 16 minutes, 54 seconds, then told \"they\" were busy, and I could call back, or get an email address to submit for cancellation.  Sound like how you want to spend your time?  As another reviewer said, what legitimate company makes you jump through a bunch of hoops to cancel?  Automobile service contracts come to mind.  Slimy operators.  No value.  Would not recommend."

I call them, It appears I have an old number card and the number changed without letting me know, they changed after partner separation. I do not receive any alert or email anymore and my account does not exist, I have to create a new one and provide again all security info again, but I have back payments on my statement every month since 2013. . They called me only when my card expired to take a monthly payment. Customer support was unable to connect me to a \"higher authority\" Manager to answer my questions about what I am paying for what is their promise to comply.? What kind of protection do I have if they do not update my personal information,  keep me informed, alert me, and what would happen If I had ID theft, they could not find me in the system? I really hope that they will do something about it and comply with what they promised to provide safe and reliable protection so my money is worthed from 2013,  paying faithfully to them. If something is not right say it, and be e careful,   Please do the right thing always! Promised must be kept."

After over 45 days and various phone calls and documents provided to the credit bureaus, her account is cleared and accounts with those entities are closed!  All at no cost or worry from us!  They did the work and all she did was provide some basic documentation to support her position!  And we had 1 professional at IDShield to deal with on each contact!  Thank you, IDShield!"

My identity is my financial mealticket in the world today and letting someone else steal it could cost me a fortune. Thankfully, ID Shield has stopped numerous attempts to steal my ID. Today my wife and kids are all covered on my same family plan. The peace of mind is priceless."

So she proceeded to make purchases everywhere, all the name brands, to the tune of $26,000 with now 17 pages of derogatory credit issues against my perfect 720 score.  I was so distort that I actually forgot that I had The IdShield Benefit, it is just that big of invasion of your privacy, and course your financial future.  I immediately contacted my Idshield , Private Investigators, who within seconds, with his calming voice, assured me not to worry, that he had my BACK.. I started to calm down even more, as he told me, every step of what I should do and what he was going to do to restore my credit, back to it's before theft status.  When in hours, he had done exactly, what he professionally knew to do, and I was back to my peace of mind, and could continue on with my life without the distraction."

As a Gen-X'er I grew up pre-internet, MS-DOS programs, AOL online discs with that horrendous electronic dial up sounds. Complacency definitely scared me back to reality. IDShield is one of the benefits that the company I work for provides. I cannot say enough positive things about them as my online information has definitely made its rounds. Let's just say I had scam callers throughout the day calling to \"verify my information\".  I made the mistake one day of actually confirming my bank information. Realized it was a scam and immediately called customer service at IDShield. Although I felt like the biggest donkey, the rep immediately went to work, got my information, placed a fraud alert with the credit bureaus and advised my next steps to mitigate and/or prevent any damage. I received a follow up call not too long afterward to make sure that I was ok and that I followed the recommended steps. They were patient, calm, professional, empathetic and knowledgeable. I ended up posting on my Facebook and recommending them to all my friends and family. ~ Lifetime Member Now"

          "Contenu": "The ID Shield representative, Cheyenne, was extremely professional and knowledgeable.  She clearly understood my issue and worked diligently to correct the problem. Unfortunately, she was unable to correct the problem. I suggested maybe there was something on my end and I would contact my IT specialist to see what they could find.  She gave me her direct number and I told her I would contact her after my IT specialist investigated.  After just over and hour, my IT specialist found a few issues with my computer and corrected them. I then attempted to correct my ID Shield issues and low and behold, it made the correction indicating that Cheyenne could not have fixed it.  It is important to note, that without Cheyenne\u2019s exceptional service and expertise, I issue would likely still exist making me very irritated without justification.  Thank you for such wonderful service."

I work in an industry where we talk to people everyday who have been victims of fraud so I'm VERY careful. But, like so many other people, I fell for a scammer posing to be with AT&T/DirecTV and since I had recently contacted DirecTV about my bill, I thought it was actually them calling. They were offering me a discount. They needed my 4 digit passcode to verify my account and I gave it to them. Then they said something about my balance, and I asked what it was, and they gave me the wrong amount so I hung up. It was a weekend, so I called the emergency number and got help! They told me what I needed to do for the time being, then advised me to call back Monday to speak with someone in more detail. The thing that sold me on IDShield is knowing they are US based with US based private investigators! That alone gives me great peace of mind."
