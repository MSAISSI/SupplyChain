          "Contenu": "I would have given more stars but my last experiences with customer service let me down. You can not just give credit for free to make customers forget they had a problem. Solve it! Nobody told me why my Acc wasn't recharging(was on auto recharge) until I was left without credit, while I was traveling and I had to call to find out. Card expired. Ok.., but let me know!!!! Email me... Any kind of notification would have been helped. Ok. I went online, added a new card ad waiting for my auto charge to get going. Noooo working, I called again and they told me I had to buy credit to activate autocharge. Where does it say this when a card expires and you fill in new info for a good card? How do I supose to know? I wish they monitorise better the Acc so we don't have to contact customer service. Is it that hard to email and notify that we have an expired card? They can't see they can't get money from Me anymore??? At least that if not the concern that a customer is left without credit. Was so inconvenient when that happened.... \rOverall calling service it's ok. Easy to use. Sometimes gets icky but I can contact family easy through this... And application so helpful to use when traveling. If you find wifi you have a phone too.\rSince they don't let me replay I'll update my review for that replay: I get emails when I get credit. Sunaromania gets in my main inbox. It's on the safe list. I CAN MANAGE my emails just fine!!!! I am a smart romanian!!!  And on top of that when I called the customer service told me that they do not notify expired cards. Expired cards are not your responsibility, she said.  Why would she say that??!!! And your replay is mean!!!! I can manage my accounts good!!! Not my fault of your poor settings. I can't trust autocharge anymore and since then I have a back up calling Acc just in case. Many options nowadays. If you replay \"mean\" I might not use sunaromania in the future. You should see I have been a customer for sooo long!!!!"
