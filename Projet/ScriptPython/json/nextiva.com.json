Dozens of communications with Nextiva  to fix NextOS Portal lockout to change billing info resulted in failed solutions, or being completely ignored.When all I\u2019m trying to do is port my numbers and pay my bill.

We were fortunate to get a escalations team member that helped us cancel our account with them but on the whole I would not recommend using them for VoIP. From the beginning we were not set up for success with our phones. While the phones themselves were easy to use, the platform to add or change settings on the phones was not. It wasn't until we decided to cancel our account that Nextiva showed interest in fixing the issues we were having but it was too late for us at that point."

If it wasn't for the 2 reps I mentioned above, I would have completely canceled moving services to Nextiva.

IF you are a customer and pay for a service, at least expect to have a decent support, with humans to answer and provide you some kind of update and status, otherwise suggest Nextiva QA use AI and debug the system that is facing recurrent issues , seems since Nextiva One rev 1.0 to the latest one continue to have BUGS..BIG ONES , and fix it at ONCE ! we rely on a good communication system to keep our business up and running!"

The issues began with the billing, as every month we were presented with a different amount, often higher than what we were expecting. Even after canceling half of our lines, we continued to be billed for them for 12 months.Attempts to resolve these problems were met with extended wait times and inadequate support. Whether through phone or chat, reaching customer service became an ordeal, often resulting in waits of over an hour.These experiences have culminated in a severe lack of trust and satisfaction with Nextiva. Inconsistencies in billing and the difficulties in reaching customer support have made our relationship with this company unsustainable.I urge potential customers to consider these issues carefully and explore other options before committing to Nextiva's services.

I was hung up on twice (I assume this was by accident).  I also asked to speak with a manger 8 times, and was always told that none was available and that one couldnt call me back.Things to improve:1. Terrible Onboarding ExperienceI was promised an onboarding department to assist with new accounts.  I called a few days ago and a customer set up one phone.  We decided together that once my number was ported (today) I could call her department back to configure the other phones.  Today I was told by multiple people that they did not receive permission to transfer me to the onboarding department, even though I hadn't started using my account, because the agent a few days ago closed the ticket.  2. No one takes ownershipI was transferred a dozen times between the hardware and configuration department.  Apparently the phone configuration agents do not understand the hardware and the hardware agents do not understand configuration??  The first thought anyone has is to transfer and make my problem someone else's problem.3. Sales staff overpromisesWhen I spoke with Walter last week, he promised that you pride yourself on excellent customer service.   He told me he worked for the company multiple years and the company has great support. After speaking with 15 people I contacted Walter, who was a. Unable (unwilling) to escalate my case, b. unwilling to have a manager call me back and c. unwilling to reassign my to the onboarding department. 4. Not able to speak with a managerI asked 10 times today to speak with a manager or receive a callback.  All managers were busy.5. Upper management doesn't care.  I escalated my issues to upper management, who have yet to respond to my request to have a support manager call me back.  Its not surprising that upper management doesn't care, since their bad attitude and lack of response shows through all levels of their customer service.I want someone who is knowledgeable about the entire system to call me tomorrow (Friday) so I can finish setup."

Every time I called in with an issue, I was met with condescending tones and clueless representatives who seemed to have no idea how to resolve anything. It's almost impressive how consistently terrible their support is.But wait, it gets worse. Hidden charges seem to be Nextiva's favorite game to play. Just when you think you've signed up for a reasonable plan, they hit you with surprise fees that would make your head spin. It's like they have a secret menu of charges they unveil just to mess with you. If you're lucky, you might find out about these charges buried in the fine print of their terms and conditions, but good luck deciphering that labyrinth of deceit.Nextiva's penchant for hidden charges is just the tip of the iceberg. Their overall service is a mess of glitches, dropped calls, and outages. It's like they took a time machine back to the 1990s and decided to provide us with the technology of yesteryears. And don't even get me started on their outdated user interface \u2013 it's like navigating a maze designed by someone who's never used a computer before.In conclusion, I can't stress this enough \u2013 do not waste your time, money, or sanity on Nextiva. Their customer support is a masterclass in how not to treat customers, their hidden charges will drain your wallet faster than you can say \"scam,\" and their service is a technological disaster. Save yourself the headache and look elsewhere for a reliable and honest business communications provider. Nextiva is a sinking ship, and you don't want to be on board when it goes under."

Also, the company locks you into a 18 month contract subpar service. Their customer service takes 30 minutes to pick up your call to tell you that someone will return your call with your issue and if you don't pick up the phone exactly when they call you, they will cancel your request and you have to submit a new request for whatever issue you have. They are quick to close ticket and slow to respond to them. I'd give NEXTIVA negative stars if I could. STEER CLEAR OF THIS COMPANY - use 8x8 instead"

He emailed me the cancelation form, via docusign, for me to sign and make our final payment, which is paying for the \"free phones\" they sent us.  After I put in our credit card information and signed the documents, the screen said THANK YOU and went blank.  He assured me that I would receive a conformation email shortly...we sat on the phone together for several minutes, he placed me on another hold, only to hang up on me.  Everything about Nextiva is BULLCRAP!  If I could give a \"0\" review, you bet I would.   I know Nextiva is going to reply to this review telling me how sorry they are and all that crap, and to email them at reviews at nextiva.com.  Only to get nothing back in response, this isn't my first rodeo with this company."

They used to be a great company, super service, reliable support, etc. Three month ago I switch for their legacy Pactosis system to their lastest Nextiva One system, based upon what I perceived were more feature and better pricing that met my needs. The problem is their customer service has declined to what I consider TERRIBLE. They market their services as awesome but don\u2019t believe a word of it. Their app on IOS for an iPhone or iPad does not work properly and it will not indicate when calls are inbound. It worked fine on my desk phone or on my Mac but not on the phone or iPad. I spent four hours on the phone over several days with their app team and got switched from person to person and then finally got someone that indicated this was a know problem that many customers were having.  You would think that everyone in the company would know this and not waste their customers time. I even email Tomas Gorny, their CEO and not even the courtesy of a response or anyone from his team reaching out. Ultimately my sales person got this escalated and I was assigned a escalation manager who acknowledged their problem and told me it should be resolved over two months ago and that he would keep me informed of their progress. Never received an email or call from him again. If i treated my customers this way I would expect to be fired! Don\u2019t believe their marketing and don\u2019t waste your time. I wish their customer support was what they used to have."

They said that since we were an \"old\" customer, our dashboard was not up-to-date. Seriously? You can't get existing customers updated with the latest systems? I was told they would send me a link that would take me directly to the billing portal where I could change our information. Waited forever with each person, only to be told their system was having problems. Long & short - on the phone with them for and hour and a half and still did not get the problem resolved.

The problem in my opinion is poor reliability and support.  Almost without exception my tech support call is more than 60 minutes and usually requires multiple calls to fix somewhat easy problems.  For example, phone extension configurations not maintaining their settings.  Also tech support is handles out of the Ukraine which can be a problem when explaining the problem and or getting issues resolved.  I suspect that is why I am tied up on the phone for 1-2 hours trying to resolve problems."

It took weeks to get installation added, at additional cost.  Their \"installation\" was a fraud.  After more delays, we were finally told they could not find anyone, so we were back to square one.  Once we got all the phones hooked up, we had myriad glitches--like our night attendant not working, our passwords needing constant reset, etc.  Now our contacts are a black hole.  Still cannot get refund for installation charges, or even the first two months of \"service\" where we never made a call."

Good support entails proper setup, proper comprehension and getting things done right the first time. Their sales department is flawless. But as soon as you pay for services, you realize that you are kind of on your own. It takes forever to port numbers out. You have to create tickets and reach out to support for every part of the setup, it's simply not seamless or white glove to any degree. There's nothing cohesive about the company. It's like you need to deal with a whole new platform for each feature. Like SMS, recording voicemail, etc. They have a LONG way to go for their platform to be adequate. NOTICE! Their mobile app is complete garbage. You CANNOT run your business through their mobile app. It works 1/4 of the time and has list of bugs from NY to Mexico. It's mind blowing that they onboard customers to an app so deficient. Do they not understand that phone calls are an integral part of running a business? Anyway, so much more to say, but I need to go. I'm switching providers yet again and I'm not even one month in. Horrible experience."

          "Contenu": "I've been with Nextiva for about 2 years now and initially they were great. Customer service and the support team was very responsive when we called in and resolved any issues we had quickly. When our company started growing and began adding extensions we opted to transition from a month to month plan to a 3 year contract so that we could receive discounted pricing. Nearly a month and a half later Nextiva has not transitioned us to the contract and we are paying nearly $100.00 more per month because of it. We've called to follow up on our request at least 8 times and each time we're told someone will call us back to take care of the request and that our ticket has been escalated to a manager but yet no manager calls back. This makes me question the integrity of this company and it's advertising. The \"Amazing service\" they coin themselves on leaves much to be desired. Will be looking for another service provider who can stand behind their customers.UPDATE 3/10/20: It's been over 2 weeks since I wrote this review and wanted to provide an update. I did receive a message and email from one of the managers at Nextiva however response time back was slow (days) and resulted in no resolution. Emails back and forth asking if a contract was sent to me and then no response and no contract. Tier 1 support is much better than those that supervise them at this company. Unfortunately, Tier 1 support doesn't have the authority to implement contracts. Something is seriously not right here. Do your research and select your phone provider wisely."

The restrictive licensing means that accounts need to be renamed to people who take over their positions, but if someone does that or gets married it's impossible to re record somebody's name without talking to support.4. When you try to create an account without licenses left, you're told that there's an error making the account and to try again later.If you have more than 10 users and need to manage a large number of extensions I would recommend against Nextiva until some significant fixes are made on the back end.

One topic he fixed (I sure hope it doesn't break something else) the other topic he argued with me about how Nextiva doesn't offer a service that I was following up.  I decided to drop the topic and reach out to our rep.  I just didn't feel like my tech wanted to help with my options from the start."

I have a business with twenty-three telephone lines and with future expansion to acquire 20 more in the next six months and they treat me like the worst of their clients.  I have opened cases in the CRM department and they tell me that they are going to contact me by email and nothing.  I recommend you not to do business with this company, the lack of communication would generate losses and if your account is managed by Kristi Poehls, I would wish you luck because she never takes calls and even less would help you by emails."

          "Contenu": "Honestly, it's been rocky the past several months. One of our biggest issues is with the new NextivaOne App. We lost much of the simplicity and functionality of the old app. It's not been a smooth transition at all. Several of our employees refuse to switch to it until they absolutely have to. The other big issue is we are unable to call some customers and prospects because their phone number gets stuck in porting it out of your system. And it literally takes DAYS to get that fixed. It's a very frustrating and time-consuming process. We are a sales and customer service company. To be unable to contact our prospects and customers is totally unacceptable. Also, wait times for both phones and chats are ridiculous. I've waited up to 40 minutes to talk/chat with someone. On the positive side, our account manager, Jason Quist is fantastic. He's responsive and truly concerned about getting our issues resolved. Unfortunately, he can only do so much. It seems once an issue gets to the support side, things go downhill. I hope this is a temporary situation as we've been with Nextiva a long time and really don't want to switch. Thank you for being open and receptive to feedback."

There are many issues with the new NextivaONE app, usability, reliability, etc. Additionally, there have been many issues where a device or feature isn't working properly, the error message seems to point to a setting that was not set up properly, and yet when we contact support they seem to be the result of back-end malfunctions. For example, we have assigned a license to the user, but are receiving the error that there is no valid license, only for support to quickly solve the issue. Support staff is always very helpful, positive, and friendly. But you will have to contact them for things you shouldn't have to contact them for, because the changes you make to your account through their online portal are not always successful."

They ported over our number, customers received an out of service message for the first day until we called in to report it and something was changed. The next day we had to call in again just to get our phone voice system working again.Texting is very important to our business.  We repeatedly voiced our concerns and needs regarding texting both verbally and in writing.  We were assured that texting and the texting features we requested were going to be implemented on launch day.  Since the day of the port, they neglected to tell us that texting was not set up.  We discovered that texting was not up from complaining customers.  We asked them to correct this but it could not be completed for another 4 days since the weekend was coming and it could not be done until Monday or Tuesday.  Forget all of the texting features we were promised, those don't actually exist.  Now we would settle for basic texting. It has been a disaster.  The \"local\" customer service is actually from the Ukraine when it is after hours, the weekend, or the call center is full or whatever reason you can think of.  Only go with Nextiva if your businesses a hobby and you have no calls for a month during the set up process.  Even then it may not be worth the effort and calls to customer service to try and make it work."

Overall, I give Nick and CR 4 stars for their excellent service."

No longer do I get a separate tickler notifying me of text messages vs phone calls.  They are all lumped into one notifications screen.  The has led to multiple missed text messages.  The app updates frequently and messes with my blue tooth setting cutting off access to my mic, but not the speaker.   The layout offers either too much or too little in the viewing screen and I need to bring in a technician to mess with the settings.  This should not be this difficult."

          "Titre": "Good VOIP and Fax if your own internet service is decent; confusing method to downgrade service",
          "Contenu": "UPDATED POST (Jan 11, 2023):Nextiva's team escalated my matter about a week ago; I had received notice via email from them. From there, Nextiva was helpful in ultimately refunding me the amount I felt was appropriate for the unwanted-double-accounts and cancelling the unwanted account/services. I  appreciate that they ultimately fixed the situation to what I was seeking, but I wish it didn't take up so much time and energy to get their attention to this.Final thoughts: \u2014Good/reliable online-fax services. \u2014Good/reliable VOIP services if your own internet connection is good enough to maintain a stead/clear phone call (good internet download speed and upload speed). \u2014Price is competitive/good. \u2014Terrible experience in downgrading services. ORIGINAL POST (Jan 3, 2023): Service seemed fine if my connection was good. But they will not timely cancel an account even if it was created in order to downgrade a prior account. Background: Around August 2020 I had originally signed up for their mid-tier VOIP service plan (multiple phone lines and a fax). After two-years, I wanted to downgrade because we simply didn't need multiple lines.In order to downgrade, Nextiva's representative (W. Myers) had me sign up for a new account; he explained that my desired phone number would be ported to the new account and the old account would be closed. He gave me a whole analogy to explain why a second account was needed \"we need to build a new house (account) and move-your old phone number into it, then tear down the old house (account)\" to explain why merely downgrading my service-plan required opening a second account. First, it took him several weeks to get me the contract for the new account (caused me to get billed on the mid-tier account). He said it was Nextiva's system that wasn't ultimately delivering the contract for the new account. I finally got the new account contract in October 2022. I was told that they would be immediately cancelling the account. However, three-months later (and about 4 hour-long phone calls to their customer service), I am still having to call and email them. Keep in mind, the account that needed to be cancelled was on a month-to-month subscription. There was no required notice of cancellation nor wait-time. Nextiva: Terrible at downgrading your service or cancelling an account (even if that account was created at their suggested for the mere purpose of downgrading services). To be honest, their customer service tried to help during those hour-long calls. I received follow up emails from them stating they were tryting to cancel and to wait a little extra due to the holiday season, which I was fine with, but this problem lingering like this is unacceptable. I do not respect the sales-team there."

Once that was understood, setup was straightforward.Voice quality is excellent with a 75/20 Mbps Uverse pipe.An issue remains with getting all the extensions in the home to ring. This seems to be due to the REN limitations on the ATA, and is being addressed with another solution.Because Nextiva is business oriented, the voicemail greeting system is a little impersonal for a home line. Sergio B was very helpful in reseting my voicemail so I could record a more appropriate greeting."

But finally it is working.----For a month trying to port 2 DIDs and set up account. Made a small mistake in the form first time but the customer service never follow up with me on it, had waited when I contacted them. The messages they sent always hit to SPAM folder. So have to whitelist whole their domains. After correcting that mistake - it takes a while for migrate the numbers. Somehow they migrated one DID out of 2. One is key one is missing. Screwed up all inbound faxes. The faxes for the number which has not been migrated - not coming anymore to email from old vendors nor on new one. The customer service representative always trying to put a blame on the customer.I have to pay full month extra, ending up for paying 2 extra months for old vendor plus Nextiva. Even I cannot use anything on Nextiva for that month - they keep telling the problem is mine. Maximum that they willing to reimburse 2 weeks, even full month is not used.Customer service always try to call you, discuss issues on their convenient schedule, disregarding you asking them email me. Do not care if you on travel, do not care if you have to pay for roaming changes while on travel.The account, online access, somehow keept removing without ability to reset password. Every time you have to write / call them.They response when they want. Not the same date. Be aware."

          "Contenu": "EDIT: Leaving my original review below for authenticity, but leaving my latest experience at the top for focus on the outcome.Ultimately was connected with a gentleman named John who took ownership of the situation. He made clear with no uncertainty that they saw an issue, were taking ownership of it, allowed me to be heard, and were immediately implementing a resolution.True to his word, they overnighted a wireless accessible device, got an engineer to connect it immediately, and only then did we discuss the reviews that were left. Accidents happen and I don't fault them for that. It was a frustrating few days working for a resolution and feeling burned. That said, push come to shove - they owned it, they apologized, they listened, they made it right, and they said they would take the situation into account for improving their policies and procedures for situations similar to this moving forward. If anything, I must say the acted with integrity here in the end. Frustrated customer turned around and I would say I feel loyalty to them after all is said and done.Original Review:Called in for help provisioning a Yealink T48G phone with upgraded Wifi capabilities. Representative goofed up and downgraded the firmware to the point the Wifi capability was eradicated. The initial solution was for me to go around and find a neighbor who would be able to assist with correcting his error. 2 hours on the phone with support and I'm told they would be able to have a replacement sent to them, they could get the Wifi functionality working, and then send me way. I was told this would take many days with 2 different deliveries between manufacturer, Nextiva, and ultimately me. This was unsatisfactory and I was told to wait 24-48 hours for a manager to escalate and come up with a better solution. 48 hours went by and no information, so I called back in. This time I was offered to use their app on my cell phone and was ridiculed for not having my phone hard wired vs using wirelessly... in the year 2020. The he then said his best solution, which was now not as effective as the first, was that he would credit my account for a shipping label. That I was to package, ship, wait days for them to attempt to fix phone, receive phone back, and then ultimately begin back where I started. When I confronted how absurd this was and that the previous solution offered was poor, but far superior - I was then told to speak to the escalations department (ei cancellations). I confronted that I never said nor insinuated that I was looking to cancel my service, but simply be set back to my original condition prior to their mishap, I was told to then wait for a call from escalations and that was their best and final solution. At this point my Wifi enabled phone is no longer Wifi enabled, my service has not been functioning as I've been paying for during this time, and I'm no closer to any solution that after my initial 2 hour conversation. I would highly suggest anyone considering this company for their services explore alternative options. The tech support team isn't trained well enough, their mid level managers explored intelligent options, but have their hands tied, and their senior level managers are dismissive and not reasonable nor fair in their problem solving endeavors."

Let me just say...he was more pleasant than Kacy. Jordan was very accommodating. He and I worked out the details of my plan...which I was extremely happy about... Jordan then sent me to my on-boarder...Oksana.  She was also amazing and very efficient.  They say they are going to walk you through the setup, but they actually take over and do everything for you.  I pretty much just sat back and watched...and I loved it!!!  Kacy, Jordan and Oksana had answers to all my questions, made me feel like a person not a number and provided me with a service that exceeded my expectations in ALL areas.  I am excited to start my new venture with Nextiva!!!"

Carlos informed me that I did not need to go month to month (contract) in order to remove the SMS on my account. The other rep, told me that. Carlos continued to call me until we were able to connect.  I appreciate his help.  I have not had this experience with other reps at Nextiva in the past, this is the first, so I feel that Carlos needs to be recognized.  I have always received conflicting information and Carlos finally was able to set the record straight. Thank you, Carlos!"

We are still waiting to port our business numbers (local, toll-free, and fax numbers) over to the new phone system, but if that goes well then we are going to be very pleased with the new system.  It is all easily customizable through the online account website, we have the control to change or modify almost everything instantly (phone tree, display on each phone, voicemail system, etc), and the many clear and helpful online video tutorials make every change super easy.  If our numbers port over without a glitch, then Nextiva is amazing.  Our new phone systems is going to be much more robust than we ever expected."
