Your company should stand by the product represented on Instagram as a quality product and if a consumers perception is otherwise...the company should accept the return with charing the consumer to pay for shipping to return an inferior product. I will contues to shop off line at best buy. I pay for what i see amd not what i hope to get.  Thank you,"

I was a bit disappointed, I received a product and it was/is indeed in working order, however the packaging wasn't the same as it was advertised or presented in most reviews found on the web. Packaging is old, with old \"Onkron\" logo, which isn't found anywhere nowadays, and arm itself had some differences. The plastic pads, for cable management, require bearings , another point to being advertised with plastic holders which doesn't require bearings, this old model however does. (It's exactly same as Gembird MA-DA1-01, even bearing points for plastic pads is the same ).Top plastic pad doesn't have \"Onkron\" logo, which made me suspicious while unpacking the product, however presented product matches everything which is shown on the old box it was provided in.It is indeed Onkron product, however very old version of it.Package came with required bearings for mounting on the table, metal however has some traces of being either used, or more likely, being old, spending ,maybe , years in the storage. Package didn't include protective pads and instruction itself. I downloaded it from website. Product is working, however be warned that shipment may be old version of ordered product which was collecting dust in the storage for years, and in my case that was grain of salt. Otherwise product does it's job well.Connecting points on product may be little too tight and may require lubricant, however so far it's great."

          "Contenu": "I'm going to assume Onkron is the distributor, not the mfgr but if they are the mfgr this applies to them. This stand is a beast. It's heavy-duty and nice looking. It's easy to build though the directions, the print is small for these old eyes, typical for today's instructions no matter that you buy. As others have said, my only issue with it is if you want to adjust the height you have to take the TV down and unscrew the alen bolts then put it all back together. That's a design flaw IMO, it could/should be better but when you finally find the right height, you're done. Aside from that complaint would I recommend this stand, yes!POST ONKRON REPLY - Yes I saw the lifts and that'd solve a lot but they're just too expensive. Let's talk about the levelers that come extra... the handles aren't in the correct positions for tightening. IOW, one handle wouldn't tighten except on the INSIDE of the frame making it useless. I solved the problem (I hope) by removing the washer. I could've/should've added washers until the handle tightened on the outside. I have 75\" TVs coming Saturday, we'll see how it goes... So far I'm comfortable with rating this a 4-star."

          "Contenu": "A very well built solid stand. We have had it a couple of weeks now. Looks great in the living room. We have a 65\" inch skinny OLED on the 40-70\" stand. We placed it on a square plastic floor mat on top of tile. We turn it often and it rolls fine on the standard wheels - which even rolled over the tile just fine. The height adjustment is very difficult with the pop out nobs not aligning quite right. We had Geek Squad mount our TV and they had trouble changing the height even without the TV. Once mounted it was not advisable - were were unable to do it. They tried snaking the cords through the built-in cable system with no luck. After they left I tried to just put through the coax cable and couldn't even get that to go through. I used clear zip ties and Velcro wraps to \"hide\" the cords behind the stand. I also used Nano tape to apply a multi side power strip to the base. The video camera mount has two screws that are super soft and were stripped when trying to remove them to mount the plate. Fortunately Geek Squad was able to wrench it off for us. Once attached, it does not reach over our 65\" TV, but we mounted our router up there and it peeks over the top. Overall we really love the Mobile TV Stand with the two shelves. No buyers remorse so far."

Onkron knocked my doors off with the best example of customer-centric service I have ever seen. When I purchased the above described TV stand, I also purchased a nifty little battery-powered LED light, the D-4. After some use I discovered that the battery life was not sufficient to my intended use for the light, a full day desk lamp, though it was a very useful light for many other purposes. I mentioned this to Onkron in passing. Within a day, I received an email from them apologizing that the light did not meet my needs and they wrote that they were sending me out a different LED lamp, the DA5, that might suit my needs better. Without Charge!! It arrived on Friday and I have test-driven it for a few days now and it is a fantastic product. It uses a supplied AC Adaptor and has 3 separate dimmable color temperatures including a fantastic daylight setting. In addition, it has a separate 2-way LED on the column for additional ambient light which also can serve as a nightlight. It is almost infinitely adjustable and works perfectly. You just don't see this kind of attention to the customers in other companies. Whatever my needs for cool products in the future, I will be checking with Onkron first to see if they have a suitable product before going anywhere. By the way, if they had just pointed out this product to me, I would have gladly purchased it and still thought this was a great company. I also want to confirm that this is my own true and independent review and that there was no agreement to provide a positive review in return for the new lamp. They actually put the order in before they even sent me the reply email."
