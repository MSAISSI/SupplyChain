Then, the next day I got the same e-mail.....replied again. I was contacted a THIRD time today. I've checked and double checked my email to make sure it was sent in my outbox and to the correct e-mail listed on their website.Nothing. I've sent a contact form too with from a different e-mail.I'm afraid that they may not return my money; I just want my keyboard. Happy to change this review if it gets solved, but I am so frustrated that their e-mail is probably not working. It's a terrible experience.Update: The representative got back to me. They resolved my issue. I just wish I didn\u2019t have to have had to reach out 3+ times with two different emails to get this fixed. It also delayed my shipping by a few days and I was planning on making a video about it on a certain day, so it\u2019s unfortunate."

It was a bit heavier than expected but not in a bad way. It feels very sturdy.  The only reason I gave it a 4 star is because the website wasn't reflecting what they actually had in stock. Customer service was very quick in contacting me and offered other options.  It took a bit of back and forth before finding a model I wanted as a second choice but the person that helped me was very responsive and helpful. Would buy from them again."

(the guide did not mention this aspect)I have a lot of option to select the lights without the help of the app.No lag and an ok felling when typing, plus the sound when typing does not border me. (as mentioned on YouTube).Was ok with CS: GO, League of legend and Minecraft.Verry good inclination and nice feeling. (Will see how it will work after a couple of years.)Verry nice and prompt customer service Good lighting on keyboard keysBudget friendlyOverallOn a personal note, I only like this layout out of the others available so if you\u2019re not bother by not being hot swappable, I recommend this model. Hope they will upgrade this layout in the future. (and cover the cons like the other models)"

          "Contenu": "I received an email, asking me to rate the product. Unfortunately I cannot to that, because I still don't have the product. Today, 20d after I order it - still not here. I am in Europe, btw.I actually received the keyboard soon after posting this, and I am currently typing this update on it. :) \u00a0 \u00a0Still did not have a chance to use it, but the first impressions are not great. Seems the only benefit so far is the form\u00a0factor. 996% (yes, \"9\" key registers double press already) keyboard is a nice and compact, without losing too much of the funktioonallity (another doubles registered). \u00a0 \u00a0The armrest is already bended straight from the box and does not lay flat to the desk or the keyboard. The lack of middle support is not helping it - yes, it has rubber feet only on both sides, not in the middle. And it it bent a lot! The keyboard seems pretty sturdy, but it also has no middle support.\u00a0 \u00a0I went for brown switches. Most of the keys have nice tak-tile sound and feeling, but not all. \"Shift\" key for example feels very soft and mushy and feels more like a linear switch. Other keys has the same issue as well. Surprisingly, the \"Space\" has the most satisfying click I've ever experienced. :)\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The volume dial is a nice addition, but yet another problem. Mine rotates relatively\u00a0well half turn and the other half -\u00a0stuck\u00a0and needs a lot of force to overcome\u00a0it, aaand this is every turn. The finish of the dial is a silver paint, which I expect to peel soon, based on my experience with this type of coating.\u00a0 \u00a0My keyboard also has an impact and two scratches on the upper right corner.What I like about it: it is relatively compact, with enough functionality. Solid and heavy build - the keyboard, not the armrest. Tons of preset modes on the backlight. Generally, a nice mechanical feeling. Three levels of the angle in which you can use it.That's all for now. I will probably update my review after some weeks of usage, when I have more experience based feedback.   UPDATE 1: For me, the battery lasted about 40 hours before need for recharging. I used it Saturday and Sunday for for about 10h a day and another 5 days for about 4h each. Not great, but not terrible either. In the evening I use very little light. Because the letters are dark gray color, on a black key caps, it is hard to see them without back light, so I had it on 50% brightness.UPDATE 2: As a matter of fact RK contacted me after this review and we had a very professional communication. It almost make me happy from having an issue on a product. They seems to take very seriously customer's feedback and really work to improve their products and production methods.   They have the best customer service I've ever spoke to so far.   At that point, cannot recommend the m enough. Try their products you wont regret it. If yo even have an issue as I did - they'll take care for it.Good! \ud83d\udc4d"

Quality looks good. Battery lasts long. Did not get to test how long but looks solid. Size is very cute can be dropped into my small size backpack.

I didn't know what to do with the hardware since I don't know many people who as into computers as we are. I opted to return the keyboard and Chance made the process really smooth. I will not forget this kind gesture and wish only good things upon Chance and the rest of RK Gaming. I'm not a youtube reviewer but perhaps I'll give the keyboard a fun review as well :)"

          "Contenu": "I ordered the RK61 keyboard from this company. For personal reasons and misunderstanding on my part (I thought I ordered the RK84, nice), I sent their customer support team an email, a couple of hours later, requesting a cancellation and perhaps a refund of my order. Unfortunately (or rather fortunately) my package was already sent for shipping so I missed the time window to do so apparently. I, initially, regretted buying this keyboard, so I went on to continue emailing their support team about a potential refund. The company does not have a free refund policy and I was aware of that, so I ultimately decided to keep the keyboard. During this whole process, they kept replying to my emails every day with details on how to reject the package, how to return the package with an RMA, etc. Basically, they guided me through this (ultimately non-existent) refund process greatly, and I appreciate it a lot. I still mod this keyboard (as I expected to do), but it turns out it's a pretty solid board for its price, so I'm glad I got it (even if I don't like 60% keyboards that much). Lastly, they even offered me a direct partial refund or a gift card that both covered half of the shipping fees in USD. That was rather unexpected and very kind on behalf of them, they didn't have to refund me anything, let alone keep replying to my emails even when I told them I'm going to keep the keyboard. I can't really complain about their refund policy because well, it is their policy, so I don't hold any grudges. Overall, even though I was kind of disappointed that I couldn't cancel the order even a couple of hours after it's been placed, it really isn't something negative. That just means they're reliable. Their support team helped me through the process and I'm thankful for that."

To my delight, I received a fast response from them, and although I was able to solve the issue myself before they got back to me, their customer support representative was courteous and knowledgeable.One thing where there's room for improvement is that a few days earlier I submitted a similar request via the rkgamingstore.com website. But no-one acted on that request as far as I could tell. So simply send an email to support[at]rkgaming.com. This seems to work best.Update: the minute I sent out this review someone also responded to my request via the website. This changes my score from 4 to 5 guys. \ud83d\udc4c"

They assisted me and resolved any issues I had. I would recommend this company and I encourage potential buyers to find promotions when shopping."
