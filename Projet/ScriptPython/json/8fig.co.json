          "Contenu": "Everything was going fine until the end of March of this year when SVB collapsed and they pulled back all of my funding and the plan had me remitting huge monthly amounts of 10k per month.  After that, I tried to borrow to pay them and had to take out new loans because I was paying them huge amounts monthly and now my finances are in a shambles.  Do not trust this company because they do not care about what happens to small business owners.  I honestly wish that I had never dealt with them.I've had some time to think about it and I think they just say that they want you to scale but the ultimate goal is to turn whatever money that they lend you into an expensive merchant cash advance loan!  Each time you ask to have the repayment term extended (after they've pulled back the funding), they just add more money onto the loan and say it is for the \"cost of funds\".  This is really a merchant cash advance which for most small businesses is bad news and a trap!"

The 8Fig online account claims that we received way more funds than we did and when it was brought to their attention they refused to update it. Flat refused. So, what were we charged interest on when there is a set of false accounts? We are still not sure. It\u2019s a poorly run, untrustworthy outfit that let us down and seems to have major transparency issues. Make of that what you will.*the response here from 8Fig is totally unrelated to the issue (looks like a cut and paste from someone in their \u2018reputation team\u2019. We had a promise of funds, they didn\u2019t pay due to \u2018operational issues\u2019, the payment that was never made is still displayed on our dashboard as if it happened and they took weeks to respond to emails when we raised it."

As sales slow down they are incapable and incompetent in working with you. They frequently lie and make false claims against sellers. My sales slowed down by 50+ percent and I was making small payments based on the cashflow of my business during this time they still continue to draft your bank account for huge remittance payments that cause your business bank account to go negative which is a huge hassle and causes many problems / ruins your banking relationship / credit. Internally they are a wreck you can be in the process of remitting payments and they will file UCCs against the business serve you with threatening legal filings with amazon to highjack all sales proceeds. They also flat out lie and comment fraud. They stated my bank account was disconnected from the platform and I broke the contract which never happened I have proof via Plaid banking software showing this was a false fraudulent allegation to justify fling UCC against my company. While they are taking all sales proceeds they are still continuing to draft my bank account for 10K+ at a time. 8fig commits fraud in the remittance schedule they are showing on the live web app software that I was transferred $7500 more dollars than was given. This is extreme fraud. I have all banking records showing all deposits received from 8fig and there is a $7500 discrepancy, I have my attorney reviewing this fraud and will soon open a case against 8fig for theft by deception. I was stay far away from 8fig. I would recommending growing organically and self funding as much as possible. Traditional bank loans are 1000% superior than 8fig."

          "Contenu": "At first, it was good and smooth but not anymore.  After the SVB collapse the growth fund was basically rescinded and we now owe all of it back and are not getting funded anymore.  I am working with Juan and the first time I reached out after two weeks of not getting funded, it took about 2-3 days to receive a response after trying to contact in multiple ways (instagram, Facebook, by phone, email, messaging on their site, etc.).  Once I did get a response I was told that due to new protocols every single account is being reviewed before being funded and not only that, I wouldn't be receiving funds but (now that my growth plan was \"revised\") instead owed a whole lot of money back at once.  For a small business, that can be detrimental. I never experience this with Kabbage which is now the American express business line of credit. Here is the message I get on 8fig's dashboard now:Review your revised Growth Plan.TodayOur team revised your plan following a recent request. Your Remittance Schedule will remain paused for 3 days, or until you accept.This revised plan basically says I owe upwards of 40k in the next month without any additional funding until June. I no longer trust this will actually be funded because they never deposited funds on 3/30 when they were supposed to!   I'm facing losing my business now because I ordered inventory and set up marketing based on my original growth plan that has now changed drastically.  Not only is there no growth to be seen on the plan, I may be out of business sooner rather than later.  With a child that is going to college this year, that scares the crap out of me and has caused me many sleepless nights.Very, very scary!Edit--7/28/23--I never got funded and as I stated now owe a whole lot of money back in a short time, to the tune of my account being drafted every 2 weeks and it's a horrible experience.  I would say if you do get approved and choose to go ahead with funding from 8fig have a backup plan in case they decide to pull back the funding because there's no long term repayment option with them and you will owe a LOT of money back at once.  I've been hospitalized due to the amount of stress and anxiety this has caused me!  I ordered lots of stock and spent a lot on marketing, and owe a lot of money!"

          "Contenu": "Our experience with 8fig has been thoroughly disappointing. Communication with their team can be frustrating, and took us many repeated attempts to get detailed information about our funding application. The store and banking integration in their online application process broke repeatedly, and we received conflicting and incorrect automated email responses during the application process. There were discrepancies and communication breakdowns throughout because we conduct business in a non-USD currency, and the team did not seem to be familiar with businesses outside of the US. When we did finally sign a funding contract, the funds were not delivered on the specified date (understandably, because of the SVB banking meltdown), but after two weeks we received no proactive communication from 8fig and no funding. We did, however, receive a message indicating that we would be debited for our first remittance payment even though no funding had been received. It's hard to imagine a more convoluted, opaque, frustrating and disappointing experience than what we just went through with 8fig."
