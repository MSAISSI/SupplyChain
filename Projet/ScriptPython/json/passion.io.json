          "Contenu": "Like many others, If I could rate this -10 I would.  I signed up for the Passion Plus program, a 15K USD program as it was promissed to be a \"done for you\" experience, and a roadmap of what to do first, second, third etc.  Well, other than a spreadsheet with various technical things I needed to do such as creat a google business app account etc, there was no \"roadmap\". Granted, I had some difficulties too.   I had a broken arm and it wasn't healing as quickly as I had anticipated...so recording fitness programs had to go on hold....Then I had a family crisis with a sudden death that needed my attention to family members.... So not much was accomplished as a result from Nov when I had my kick-off call to April.  Then when I finally got working on the app, I felt overwhelmed as there was no roadmap......so I asked for a 3-month \"break\".  They continued to bill me in July by taking the final payment, and never reached back out.  The program is supposed to offer bi-weekly 1-1 coaching.... It doesn't.....or at least it didn't in my case as I only received a handful of such calls, and it was me who finally reached out 6 months later in September and said, ummm is anyone there?  If I were billing a client that much money and promising a specific outcome, I would be on them, and at the very least, trying to find out why they are MIA and how I could be of service.   When I finally did reach someone, Jarret, he admitted that there was some \"breakdown\" on their side.  I asked him to tell me whether he believed they had delivered on their promises.  He never answered my question but had offered to \"extend\" my program by a few months.  Generous since they are the ones who didn't deliver on their promise.... It gets quite complicated, but after asking about a new program they have, \"Expert Growth,\" and I just really wanted to know what it was about, they convinced me to say \"yes\" to this program that they said was currently being billed at \"5K\". Then I get an email saying that my \"membership\" had been \"downgraded\" and that I no longer had access to the VIP Passion Plus program.  I never agreed to being \"downgraded\" and what I want is to simply be given what I paid for and what I was promised.... a freek'n roadmap of how to put together an app.....  They have no phone number, and it takes weeks to hear back from anyone.  I did ask for a refund since they failed deliver on their promises..... I am still waiting to hear back... I will update as to just how long that takes and what the resolution is...... extreemly frustrating, so if you don't want this in your life, stay away from PASSION.IO."

We signed up for a 30-day trial and then cancelled within the required time frame.... during the correspondence to cancel, WE WERE BULLIED into extending for another further 60 days despite not wanting to extend. When WE REQUESTED A REFUND  FOR A SECOND TIME they refused, saying we were out of the time frame. We have been charged for 12 months. Many emails have gone back and forth with their customer service team. We are considering legal action on the grounds the cancellation policy violates consumer protection laws by placing unreasonable and unjustified barriers to receiving a refund. Given the number of similar experiences noted on this review platform, I hope this company changes its ways. If you need to strong-arm people into extending the \"free\" trial to then withhold honouring refunds so desperately... it tells us all something about your product and business ethics. POOR FORM! So many great companies out there... Choose Wisely People! This one is young and unethical!"

During this time Passion IO took \u00a3809 from my account for my year's subscription. I contacted them to politely request a refund because I cannot work on my app due to my situation and subsequent months of chemo and quite frankly needed the money because I couldn't work, and explained that I was in hospital for a month, throwing up diarrhea, having a tube shoved down my throat while I was awake, a central line trying to stay alive, and sent them photos and doctors notes etc in the hopes that they would respond with kindness and help me. But they chose not to. Their \"reason\" (excuse) is that I should have requested a refund within 30 days. What, while I was fighting to stay alive you mean? I couldn't deal with anything how on earth was I to deal with business? I guess my cancer didn't really care too much about Passion IO's arbitrary rules. The truth is, they can choose to do whatever they want, they can bend the rules and they can be kind and gracious, they have just chosen to be mercenary. I had drunk the cool aid and thought they were the real deal but I guess they are just money hungry, unsympathetic, mean people. Dan should be ashamed of himself for treating another human being this way."

To find whether someone ihas already been added to a certain course, you need to find their email, use earch, click on their name, and then view a popup. so time consuming#11 when complaining about missing features, hardly anything changesThere is probably more that I forgot, am moving to a different system which is such a relief. Only coming back today to cancel and all the furstration of the past year is coming back. Worst thing, I lost loyal high ticket customers because they were so frustrated with how bad the app functioned.if you are considering buying, please don't save yourself the frustrationa nd the loss of your clientsPS as you can see by this review, i am detailed person and gave precise feedback. doing what i can to make things better. they invited me at a team meeting to share but hardly anything changed. so glad my initial year was over and i shifted"

          "Titre": "Beware of the Subscription Renewal Process - Opaque at best. Illegal at worst. Issue Requires Resolution",
          "Contenu": "I recently had a negative experience with Passion.io that left me feeling quite disappointed and frustrated. In fact, it has been the worst online transaction experience I've had in my life.  While I believe in the potential of their platform, there was an issue with their subscription renewal process that I think needs to be addressed and corrected.Initially drawn to the platform's promise of being a fitting solution for my business, last year when I signed up for the service, I had high hopes. However, the reality fell short, as the app lacked key functions and didn't adapt to my needs as I had anticipated. The decision to discontinue use was my own responsibility, and I accept that.What I cannot accept, though, is the opaque and bewildering subscription renewal process that followed a year later. Without any prior communication, messages, notifications or alerts, my account was charged directly from my bank account for another year's subscription. I didn't even receive a single notification or a confirmation email of this renewal, leaving me unaware until it was too late.It's worth noting that Passion.io has a 30-day money-back refund policy, which seems fair ON THE SURFACE. However, this policy is rendered almost meaningless by the fact that they fail to notify users of the impending renewal. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to exercise one's right to a refund, and at worst, it appears to walk a thin line with legality. Unfortunately, I'm not the only person to have encountered this disheartening scenario. A quick glance at other reviews in Trustpilot indicates that this might be a systemic issue, rather than an isolated incident.I genuinely believe in the potential for Passion.io to empower users in their pursuits, but this experience has cast a shadow over that belief. I urge Passion.io to rectify this situation urgently by not only addressing my case and issuing me a refund but also by improving their communication and renewal processes for the sake of all users.As someone who values open communication, accountability, and fairness, I sincerely hope to see a swift resolution to this matter. Your users deserve to be treated with respect and transparency."

With no refund of money, and last email taking a month for a responseUpdate: they seem to reply very quickly when called out publiclyUpdate: you missed many things.From the start, I was promised a few things when I signed up through webinar that were never delivered to me. This was reported and never rectified. The webinar stated the charge was going to be (for that day only which I signed up that day)  in whatever currency you were signing up in for example if it was $999, that was it whether it was Canadian or US you were being charged $999 you currency , however, I was charged conversion rate which ended up being over $300 more again. I thought your company was worth it I talked to representative they apologized and said they would update the webinar and we moved on.The other items promised a ring light and some other things. I honestly don\u2019t remember off the top of my head were never ever delivered to me. I reported that with no response or rectification, and I have no idea if it was on you guys or the shipping company but either way I never received. There was a delay for a month where you guys weren\u2019t doing anything, but I had been told that the app was in processing. Your team never reached out to me. I had to hound them with numerous emails before they realized error was on them so to rectify they offered me free months again never received because I cancelled acct, we\u2019re a month behind now.Once the app finally did go into processing and was approved, yes, my app was approved right away because I ensured I had done absolutely everything I was told. There was never an ability to take payment that was on Apple, however, I reached out to your team and yes this was finally rectified weeks later please remember at this point I believe I was four months in and could not take a payment from a client did not have an active app. Then the app never functioned properly after that. There was only one part of it that was ever actually completed by apple when there should have been numerous options available for people to purchase continually being a problem people were reporting to me, which again I report it to Apple and let your team know. I was so frustrated at this point with not getting emails back. I had even reached out to Dan on Facebook which took a week which took a week for an automated message. replied saying we\u2019re really glad that somebody got back to you because by the time he had somebody had already emailed me not with a solution they had just emailed me the directions on what I needed to do with Apple. I finally got extremely frustrated with your team since it had been over six months and I did not have a functioning app and had completed everything that I was told I had to do and it was just continuing to get the runaround.Then recently, I finally went ahead and cancelled my account which took you guys many weeks to get back to me.There was much back-and-forth on what I needed to do  so i did not continue to be charged. Last email sent was December 4 wanting to ensure none of my information. My intellectual property was still left with your company or apple, and it took you guys till January 4 to reply.upPassion boasts a 30 day moneyback guarantee however, you know that the information you provide takes 30 days to go through,  yes you could skip ahead but for those of us who didn\u2019t have experience in creating an app we need to follow it step-by-step.so you would not even have an app in 30 days it took much longer for me to Discover the level of incompetence and that I wanted a refund and it should have been provided either in full or in part due to all of these issues. Instead, you continually just offered free months to a client that was unhappy and didn\u2019t get what they were promised."

There support is very kind but real unprofessional. Do not understand the problems and cannot find the solution. Tipical cheap outsourced solution. So they cannot fix the problems, which are usually pricing plan issues. We are paying the monthly fees but could not make income. I wrote many claim mail, but they absolutely don't care about it. This their customer care policy. Take the money and doing nothing."

          "Contenu": "My business partner and I, joined passion back in May of this year, and up to this date, Passion has let us down with several reoccurring problems. These problems include a big lack in timely responses, not providing timely updates as it pertains to our app submission process, and a major lack in customer support. For example, we sent an email to Passion on August 8th and we didn\u2019t hear back from Passion until August 14th, and the reason that was explained to us is because one person was on holiday. Events such as these are definitely unacceptable, especially when we\u2019re paying $297 a month for the ultimate package. The support, or lack thereof, hasn\u2019t matched what we\u2019ve been paying on a monthly basis. We have major events that we\u2019re planning for our company, which is predicated off of our app and when we can start. The lack of timely responses, lack of support, and waiting sometimes 5 or more days before we can even get a phone call with someone has been a horrible experience to say the least. Even now, currently, all we\u2019re told is \u201cwe\u2019ll improve\u201d, and we have yet to see any improvements. For about two weeks now, we've been told that a \"bug\" is the reason why our app hasn't been successfully submitted, and we haven't heard back from Passion since. I've sent countless emails to Passion, and Dan, and we have yet to receive a response from anyone, and at this point it feels like we've been taken advantage of. We've been waiting three months for our app to be up and ready to go, after initially being promised that this would be a 30 day process. At this point, frustrated is an understatement."

I think it\u2019s important to share my experience as I seen a ton of people unsure about the app and it\u2019s success. I think it should be communicated that the same way they teach you to sell courses as an in progress app that is in the growing phase so is passion.io. If I did not already have the means of selling my high ticket items outside this app I would have had a even bigger loss to my business due to the horrible support of passion.I signed up in December 2021 and as of April 2022 none of the issues had been fixed.The ability to not be able to use the newest feature The community channel, was the breaking point for me.My bugs so far:FAQ issue where the FAQ just shows a blank page.Community channel feature not working.Loading screen still the wrong image from the Begging of my app.Native apps not having the ability to edit to submit.Lag and skipping through videos that are uploaded through the app.Incorrect logo and name upon download of the native app.Android loading issue when users access the app which does not allow scrolling.Android users not able to access the app at all in its native form.Since I\u2019ve launched this app I have not been able to access its features. On top of that, all my sales 60+ subscribers are all generated through social media, which completely goes against Passion Dan advertisement. I signed up from his ad saying you don\u2019t need social media but then in the challenge they tell you to post on social media \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude15\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0fEach month since December, almost on a weekly basis I have reached out to the passion support team to fix the bugs that have stopped my business from growing. The support has been poor as I reported issues and it takes and even weeks to get a solution, a solution that does not fix the issues. After months of frustration I\u2019ve moved my courses alto teachable and have gotten immediate results. Upon cancellation, they refused to refund me and even told me my app hasn\u2019t been updated since December 29th 2021, that\u2019s why my bugs were so heavy. I SAY THIS FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART, do not use this platform to grow your teaching business. There are so much better platforms with true success who naturally offer apps that actually work. Invest in your business and in yourself not Passion.io or Dan."

          "Contenu": "*UPDATE*Having promised they would get in touch to give me compensation, no such thing has happened. I was doubtful about the integrity of this company but now I am downright disappointed and would go as far as to say it's all about looking good but they do not care beyond that. What compensation was going to be made to me I wonder? I would feel some kind of refund would be fair as I was falsely sold something but it seems at most I would be offered a 'free extension' of my membership which would only ever be of any value if I was willing and able to make future payments. Why would I continue to pay into something that lacks any integrity and doesn't serve me? It's clever. They look as if they might care and are giving back to you but they are actually just trying to make more money out of you. I did expect an email however, when they stated they would contact me via email. I have checked all inboxes and junk box for weeks and nothing. That is just outright lying. Avoid this company, they just want your money.Original review:Tread carefully when joining passion. There are A LOT of hidden costs and it wasn't clear to me that you'll not only be paying the huge fee for the course but in order to have the app you create with them you'll have to pay a monthly subscription of quite a lot of money. For me it was half the money I have to join the course. I wasn't given the support I needed as someone with learning difficulties- the only support call was a group joining call went way too quickly for me and I was only shown the 1 to 1 help service after it was too late to get a refund. It's sold as a 'this will work for everyone' technique but actually, I was later told in my 1 to 1 call that maybe I needed to do it my own way and it doesn't work for everyone the same. It's so misleading. These people are really, really good at sales. They don't really care much about your personal welfare. It's a lot of talk about figures but not so much substance or support. I felt a bit foolish to have given over half of what I had to people that openly advertise they're making 6 or 7 digit figures. And this is another reason I stopped the course. I wasn't comfortable asking for huge amounts of money from people who don't have much, to make myself loads of money. That's essentially what they're doing. If you have plenty of money then maybe this works for you, but this was marketed to someone like me, on very low income, that it could solve my problems.  It just created a bigger problem, I have nothing for the money I paid which was $997. Literally nothing to show for that. I received a lot of lazy correspondence with the team not reading my messages properly and only willing to help me once it was too late. I wish this money was not in the pockets of people that boast about the large figures they have whilst I struggle to find work. I do not recommend signing up for passion fighters as you're fixed into many extra payments and an ongoing membership system and if you leave have absolutely nothing to show for it."

          "Contenu": "I had no problems with the service until I attempted to cancel.  There were some items I just couldn\u2019t ignore for my particular preference.  Mainly being co-branded with their platform.  There is training if you\u2019re brand new.  There is a Facebook community if you need that sort of thing. For the first 30 days (the refund period) they send you constant email communication.  After that, there is no follow up.  No \u201cI see you haven\u2019t logged in\u201d No type of check up.  Just during the cancellation period so keep that in mind as you begin.  The system is also drag and drop so you can build easily within those limits.  Now I chose to pay a little more for a month to month membership.  I wanted to test the waters and felt it was worth it.For me at this moment, I wanted more, and so I finally decided to just cancel.  I allowed them to continue charging my account $97 for months while I was inactive and still deciding.  When I finally decided 3 months ago to cancel, there is no link in your account to cancel.  No \"pink button,\" as indicated. Nothing.  You have to Goggle how to cancel your account.  Then you fill out a long form in which they make several attempts to keep draining your account to place it on hold.  A nuisance yes, but an understandable business move.  However, you get zero confirmation your account is canceled, just an email address to contact if you want additional coaching for the app.  An understandable SCAM move.  Therefore, they can and will always state \u201cthey show no records\u2019 or \u201ccan\u2019t find the form submission.\u201d On my third attempt to cancel, I finally sent an email to that email address to seek confirmation of my cancellation and my refund.  I did not seek a refund from day one, as I did attempt to use the service and I did take up space on their server.  However I did and am expecting a  refund from the additional two months and additional two cancellation forms I had to fill out.  Now that I\u2019m asking for a refund, I've since received 6 emails from them, none of which acknowledges my cancellation.  All of which are still attempting to keep me and hold on to my money.  Luckily, I use a burner account to add money to each month to pay for my \u2018on the fence\u2019 services with new companies.  Even then, Passion seems to have a tracker on when I add money, because they\u2019ve instantly stolen 2 additional payments after my cancellation attempts as soon as money hits the account.  I\u2019d be truly horrified if they had my actual banking. Any thought I had to potentially come back if the co-branding situation changed has gone out the window.  If you\u2019re willing to steal $97 per month then how can I trust you with my brand?  This review is not meant to drag them down, but inform you of what you face should you choose to cancel.  If you know, that you know, that a co-branded, drag and drop app is for you; then there is nothing wrong with this platform.  Understand that after 30 days you are on your own unless you seek out support.  But again, it\u2019s still better than most.  However, if you\u2019re on the fence, expect delays and run around when trying to cancel."

          "Titre": "ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIC",
          "Contenu": "Absolutely horrific. I have been waiting a total of 39 days now for my APPS to go live, I am incurring costs my end with no way to offset them against revenue because of Passion's complete failure in customer service.I have reached out to the support team around 20 times in total now with the most detailed response being told I need to wait. Recently support emails have gone completely unanswered. On my initial onboarding call I was promised great service from 'Marck', yet he has not replied to my email from April 12th, and the entire process is costing me to lose money each day the app is not live.Calls for 'on-boarding' are available immediately, yet you have to wait around 10 days for a call for the submission process, which is then met by fluffy details and no accurate information.Close to getting a solicitor involved now. I am even being billed the wrong amount, as I signed up for the $300 plan and they are billing me $97?UPDATE: 21st May - Spoke to the owner who was very polite and courteous. However, my questions about features that are broken, content that disappears still remain unanswered and there is a clear disconnect between the support team and the development. I waste my time writing long emails with my issues in great details to be told to book a call with someone who hasn't got a clue what my project is, or who has read my emails. Going to see if they can deliver, but I am not holding my hopes up. The $200 doesn't really mean anything as I'm already losing thousands of dollars on coaching and licensing fees because the app is 51 days late, and still not appearing on iOS or Android. Will update in the next week to see if anyone can take charge of my project and deliver.UPDATE 27th May:Received an email to say my app had gone live to Google. This was after it sat in the Google Play Store blank for 3 weeks. I noticed the logo had updated so both myself and my partner downloaded the updated version, so I could be sure it wasn't caching on my end. What we downloaded contained no content and was just all Passiom screens. The entire process now, roughly 55 days later is beyond amateur. Lost all hope completely. Built web products and digital products myself for 15 years with developers, agencies, and teams, and I honestly can say I've never come across a team so incompetent in my entire life.UPDATE 28TH MAYMy account was frozen on the basis Passion could not deliver the product, irrespective of the fact I made them aware on multiple occasions both the failure of the product, and the subsequent delays have cost me dramatically.I am now instructing my lawyer in the US, as I am now $15,000 out of pocket having prepared everything for the platform specifically.Overview:- 60 Days ago it was meant to go live- I have sent over 100+ emails - Website deleted all tracking information I had put in multiple times- Website failed to upload certain images, the button would not work on multiple browsers- App was pushed live to Android twice with zero content, and just passion branding. - I believe I was lied too about the update times, as I very much doubt Google takes 3 weeks to publish an update.- Made the company aware multiple times throughout the process I was losing money with the delays, they didn't want to know.- Have a live support person for \"sales\" but nobody for technical support - Product does not work and has been demonstrated multiple times through various trustpilot reviews.- Charged various billing amounts incorrect and in breach of contract."

          "Titre": "Approach with caution if just starting out",
          "Contenu": "I enrolled in the 30-day challenge but like many others, I hit a wall when I realized I was being coached to sell an app to potential customers when I hadn\u2019t built it. Nonetheless, I pushed on, but I\u2019m not the sort of person who can sell something that doesn\u2019t exist yet.  On day 28 you get referred to the app building process (having tried to sell it already). They suggest you film yourself teaching on Zoom using Google slides and then upload it for the first week of your app content- then your customers can access the content, which you build as you go from then on, while the app is running. There are problems with this process. Firstly, you are advised to use social media accounts to get customers for your app which is fine if you have a large following interested in your service, but not if you\u2019re starting out and have yet to gain a following. Then you are marketing to friends and family who may not be interested in your professional service given your relationships are not based on work. Next, building an app while customers are using it is an incredibly stressful process. Should you become ill for example (as I did), they could get to week two and you have been unable to film and upload content in time. The whole process seems to be driven by creating high levels of anxiety- from midway through the challenge. Running a start-up is stressful enough without having lots of additional anxieties caused. In addition, I purchased an app development service in three installments of $397, then found out I needed to start paying the same amount again every month from month 6 to retain my app. This monthly expense creates additional pressures if you are starting out and are still building a following. I became ill at the end of the 30-day challenge and have been unable to film content (I\u2019ve had a serious eye infection for almost a month). Thankfully, I didn\u2019t sell my app before building it, or else I\u2019d be in a mess now with new customers. All things considered, given my ongoing medical condition I have asked for a refund. My request was met with an automated response that directed me around a list of articles that were not responsive to my particular situation. I have been told after receiving a call from Dan that I have to prove I had an account with this company. Are they are telling Trustpilot I never had an account? I did get a refund of my final month's payment, and have requested a refund of month two, while accepting I learned a lot about sales from month one. However, I signed up for an app development course, not a sales course. The sales advice is also faulty for start-ups, let me explain as I did to Dan himself by WhatsApp- \"Facebook ads have a very limited success rate for small businesses starting out given the algorithms favour those with large followings and bigger budgets. I\u2019d already spent a lot on FB ads before coming to Passion. In the old days, social media platforms were a great help to start ups and SMEs as attracting fresh traffic was easy and free through interacting as your business page (I had a lot of success launching new e-learning courses for universities and colleges that way), but these days you cannot interact as your business page with other pages or users, and your page has a limited reach without a big budget or lots of followers, partly due to new laws governing data privacy in the EU, USA, and UK.\" So FB ads don't work as they once did, not for start-ups. This company preys on the hopes and dreams of start-ups. That's how they make so much money. Steer clear."

I signed up when they announced in app Livestreaming and Zoom capabilities in September 2022, banking on this. Then they postponed it despite this being the only reason I chose passion.

Passion.io teaches you the basics of building an online business and eventually an app but it's not for all goods and services. For example, if you don't have a huge social following or presence, it will be hard to get many people to sign up for your program. I also did NOT appreciate the super slimy sales scripts the other Passion.io partners pushed. It felt really sleazy and off-putting. Many of the lessons that Passion.io teaches you do not apply to all types of businesses and it would be hard to launch certain types of businesses. This was originally for a fitness app but it is not one size fits all. They also start charging you $300 a month for nothing. It's ridiculous!!! Be very careful of this company or you will lose a LOT of money!!!"

You are likely to waste hours, lose income and your sanity working with Dan and his \u201cteam\u201d In terms of what you get for what you pay, it is simply not worth it with other far superior providers out there.

When I went to update my credit card they offered the chance to pay annually and save $240. BUT that is not what you'd think.Actually what was on offer was a step up to the next plan for the same money I already pay. That is NOT what they said in the notification. I was ready to commit to them for a year because I thought I'd save over $240 over the year but when I complained they did nothing except say 'No you do not understand, you get a better plan that would have cost you more, hence the saving' I explained that this is not what they offered. It does not physically save me any money, I am in fact, paying the same."

I should know, they must know me personally by now.  Building the app was fun and easy and the step by step instructions excellent.  Getting it published on google play store was challenging and I struggled through the instructions.  Naively, I thought I would just press a button!  It was a two day process taking all of my brain power. Publishing to apple was a nightmare.  It has been a two month endeavor.  They rejected us six times.  But that was issues with passion, not me.  Apple doesn\u2019t  like how the app is made.  Finally, they accepted the seventh application.  To passion\u2019s credit, they just kept fixing things and plugging away.  We started this process back in November\u201921 and it is now nearing the end of April \u201822.  And we are on apple!  But the app is so full of bugs and glitches, it doesn\u2019t work and we cannot offer it to our clients.  The web app works great though.  I have no doubt that passion will help us through with these bugs.  But keep in mind that it\u2019s a six month process.  Of note, the app on the google play store, after one fix from passion,  has worked  well.  But most people like apple it seems, so we still don\u2019t have a working app."

It has been a few weeks now and I am still waiting to talk with someone...About me, Yes I am a passionate person indeed. And I have always wanted an App for my glamorous California based business. I am not really a complainer but this has been a situation that troubled me since it is really important to me. I want to expand my business and I felt this would help me do that worldwide.So when I saw Dan's webinar I signed up right away. I did it because it sounded so amazing and so easy to set up. Well this is not the case for me so far. I am not an expert in technology by any means, but have taken time over the years to learn about setting up my website, doing email blasts and social media. After the webinar, I felt like I could learn to set up this app since Dan did include training in the subscription. What makes me really concerned and a bit hopeless, is that I recently watched the video that explains how to set up the Google Play app. After seeing it I realized this particular process will be over my head. I do think you need to get outside help with the Passion io app setup process. I do not think Passion io will help me either. Another thing, Dan instructed us to ask questions in the Facebook group. He said that it was filled with very helpful engaged Passion Fighters there to help each other succeed. So I decided to ask a question and promptly got an answer. The thing was that the person that answered me directed me to his website to order his program for $49 dollars to help me figure out how to use Passion io! :) I mean he did answer my question that was nice. He was polite but that was not what I expected from the Facebook group. I actually hoped that Dan would answer me!Another really big thing is the amount of time it takes to hear back from the Passion io customer service. The marketing that Dan does seems to focus on those of us with businesses in the US.  The thing is that when you ask a question, it takes a very long time to get a reply. And when you reply back with a second question it does not get answered. This is frustrating and probably the key to why I got so annoyed in the first place. They seem to be super busy helping someone else! So that means to me that MY app is really not a priority to anyone at all except me! I just want to be honest with my experience thus far. Here is an analogy, I have been in retail for years.And I know how to treat my customers well. If they are unhappy they tell you to your face. This is the problem with trying to do your work online to a faceless support team.They do not have to show up if they do not want to. How do you feel when you go into a store with a salesperson that is standing there and does not offer to help you? Any normal person gets offended or feels rejected. So this is the case with me and Passion io. I have actually invested in the app and am still getting ignored by the salesperson! A suggestion would be to set up a group of people on the Passion io customer service based here in the US. It would be better for me that's for sure and then I could finish my app very quickly. Or perhaps, they could communicate with us US customers with the best or at least an approximate time window as to when I/we can ask a question or two based in my/our time zone. Instead of randomly contacting them at any time of day to ask questions. Just tell me/us when is the best time to communicate. We are all in business this is acceptable. I think my biggest problem here is that I am going to spend a lot of time working on this app and not understanding what to do to finish it. And then it will never get done. More time and money lost. More regrets. Wish me luck!"

          "Contenu": "I have received a full refund. Thank you PASSION.IO.As payment for my first review, PASSION.IO paid me in kind with a book. I have cancelled my access to that book, returning it to PASSION.IO. I have rescinded my original 5-star review in order to comply with Trust Pilot terms and conditions, now giving here my most honest, balanced, and unpaid review. I have received a full refund from PASSION.IO.If one reads the best of best case studies, one may decide that for a certain percentage of students, PASSION.IO provides value.  It is often the case that the top 5% of a group will have success. So if PASSION.IO features that top 5%, they should not be discounted for that fact.It may be that the Day 1 reviews on Trust Pilot are not fake reviews. One must go with one's conscience whether an excited Day 1 student can give a full impression of the results they will get by the end of their journey. The results come when a person applies effort. It follows that it is difficult to judge the value of the entire journey by the excitement on Day 1.Here is what happened to me:On Day 1, Lesson 1, at the time I entered the course, as a new student I was promised a payment in kind of a special book if I gave a review to Trust Pilot and screen-shot the review and emailed the screenshot as proof to PASSION.IO. Part of the Day 1 assignment was to follow a link provided by PASSION.IO with instructions on how to go into Trust Pilot, create a Trust Pilot account and rate the course.  Since all the other reviews flooding Trust Pilot are also Day1 or first week reviews, excited, it may be because people want to be paid in kind with the special book, and are leaving rave reviews before they test whether they will get the promised results from the course. Each student will have to decide for themselves whether they are leaving an honest unpaid review. On Day 2 I met real students who did not show, after one year, the evidence of the 30-day results promised in the sales promotions. On Day 3, I found that I had been charged $1200.00 for an add-on IMPACT ACCELERATOR course advertised with two options: $79 or $239.  My credit card fraud and dispute department agreed that it would be wise to cancel and request full refund of all charges.On Day 3, after realizing how much I trusted PASSION.IO, and wondering whether I had been taken advantage of, I took a hard look at the promotions versus results I'd observed among real students, and began to think through long term whether all student business and intellectual property are slaved to this website. Can a student transport their app to a different service provider? Or does the code belong to PASSION.IO? Dan, an owner, addresses this question, below. Thank you Dan.PASSION.IO does not appear, as of today, to have any negative reviews online. I understand from some postings on the student chats that the company has recently revamped their website and processes and has called to old students who had abandoned the course, to return to the course. I do not know the former name of this business.Despite over-charging me, and despite my observations that there is a tendency for over-promising on the promotional promises, yet there are two signals that the owners are sincere (1) they are indeed passionate in their videos and continuously encouraging to students, and (2) because they have refunded me without any resistance. These are two signs the owners are invested in keeping and growing their business. Good signs. Thank you Dan and thank you Trust Pilot."

Customer service is timely and informative but could use more methods of contact and response.  The staff seem to be friendly and cordial with a purpose to help people be a success in their endeavors. I  signed up with Passion.io approximately 5 months ago.  I am on the 6 weeks challenge course and I enjoy working on the app. I have hope for the world due to the fact we're all connected as one humanity, one spirit and one universe.My app deals with Thought Leadership with Mastermind perspectives that inspire within each of us, God's greatest gift, expression. Although,  I haven't been with Passion.io very long but I feel genuinely good about the fact that I can create an app that can reach and inspire millions.  I have been trying to get to the podium for many years to express my God given talents to the people. Passion.io gives me that opportunity to connect with our greater community to help others aspire to their success.Many times when members from customer service try contacting me, i'm busy or out of place, it isn't their fault that they can't reach me but more of mine..Let's help each other to maintain balance in an Unbalanced World.  Thank you for allowing me to share with you the review platform, I would have given you 5 stars but I thought about it and decided to leave a little room for growth, lol.I hope giving you a 4 star rating and one to grow on will be sufficient, lol."

Most people will be doing that but there are severe limitations and big expenses in putting your app through Apple and Google as opposed to offering it yourself.  Support is pretty good most of the time.  This is a relatively knew app, so it is still growing.  They charge a price (in addition to Stripe's fees) for subscriptions through your app unless you are at the highest (Ultimate Plus) level. Unlimited video upload for Ultimate and higher is excellent."

To me, seeing people ringing the bell is great for them and yes it makes you realise that the process works, but it isn't a tactic that always makes the non-bell ringers feel better. It's an overwhelming process and it does need a lot of attention it also brings up a lot from within. So on that note, I am currently considering leaving Passion not as a victim but with a realisation that maybe this isn't right for me right now - despite being someone who has a lot to offer, it just might not be the right time."

I allowed myself to be so overwhelmed about how I would be doing it. that I didn't even start. When I did start, I thought I would just be taking a leap of faith and hoping I land somewhere. As I started I realized that every single thing I needed to develop and market a course was provided for me, in the cost of my monthly fees. I have paid others thousands of dollars to teach me how to develop a course and Passion had already thought of that and included it in the program. Had I only stopped letting fear slow me down, I would have arrived here much sooner. I made $19,000 in one week following the method. I wish I started sooner! In addition to all this, I love the support provided and cannot rave enough about it. Even the support submitting the app to Apple & Google are priceless. It is totally worth it.-- I have one wish for a litttttle bit more functionality or flexibility in the capabilities of the app, but the way Passion works, I feel strongly that new updates are coming and my issues will be addressed."

I am very happy with my app. I've had a few problems along the way it's usually not because of Passion but with the way Apple or Google process things.Passion has always helped me to resolve them. I recommend Passion for anyone who wants to build an educational app with fraction of the cost."

It's been 2 months and my app is LIVE, launching this week. It looks amazing. I'm using it for life coaching, both to run a monthly membership and a high ticket program, and so far it is a HUGE improvement over what I could offer my clients with either Kajabi or Coachaccountable.

Their platform makes my coaching program so convenient for the end user and it's great to look at as well! The experience of building my own app has been made so simple with their framework. No coding necessary, and as a web builder and graphic designer, it dovetails perfectly with being able to offer audio lessons, video lessons, and downloadable files as well. They've thought of just about everything!Their support team members are super responsive and helpful. Of course, we're in vastly different time zones, but once I figured that out, communication with them was a snap! And the community they've built within their private Facebook group is worth its weight in gold.Thank you, Passion Dan and the Passion.io team for making my dream app a reality!"

          "Contenu": "I've worked with other apps for health/performance programming for about the last 4 years or so. I thought there needed to be more of an education piece. Passion has both the programming features and the ed piece so you can format it for where each applies. The great thing about the 'challenges' they offer is that they are an example of what your clients/students will be going through when they use your app....but relating to what YOU are trying to create! As the app is geared toward non-techies, this baby step/explain it like I'm five' approach is IMMENSELY valuable. This was of exponentially greater value than I've had with other apps where you just ask questions where needed. They truly do have a lot of thought put into the user experience rather than just 'selling' something and this shows and relieves A LOT of trepidation toward using their product. I never recommend as I don't know your situation. But, I don't really see downsides anywhere."

          "Contenu": "I don\u2019t know the words to express how grateful I am. The idea to join the Passion program was dictated by the strategy I\u2019ve embedded from Mark A. Lack\u2019s webinar, which is to create various types of content in order to get more people to \u201cknow you, like you and, as the outcome, to trust you\u201d. I was concentrated solely on an App as a piece of that broken bowling ball, a piece of so many pieces of content. One of my mentors said, that magic happens in the unknown, and it never happens in the known. The Expert Unleash Challenge was that \u201cunknown\u201d for me, and this is where the magic happens. In one of my motivational videos I said, that I want people to overcome depression faster and in a more efficient way, then I did, and I wanted to simply redirect them to the personal development programs, that helped me to overcome my depression. I dreamed of creating my own program and making it simple, but didn\u2019t know how to start. These, purely, theoretical assumptions of Expert Unleash Challenge became real, and I know now exactly what to do and how to do it. Thanks to EUC, I\u2019ve already learned so much. My two music compositions dedicated especially to my Badass Clown\u2019s Method are already published by all major music platforms. The text of the lyrics was immediately accepted with no restrictions, and it\u2019s an information for my potential clients, that it\u2019s something, that makes sense, not only a fantasy from that weird guy's mind. I\u2019ve published a live workout event simulations on YouTube, and was amazed how effectively that platform works. All that and all other benefits became possible thanks to Dan and his Great Team. Thank You Guys so much. You are absolutely Genius!\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc9c"

Even offering support when I am ready to return to the app, was something I was not expecting and deeply grateful for. I believe this is the key difference between PassionApp and other community and course building apps. Thank you again Ayz - I truly appreciate you."
