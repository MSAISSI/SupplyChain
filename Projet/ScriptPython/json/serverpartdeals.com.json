I ordered many hard drives and, like most people that have a DVR/NAS/SAN, wrote the order number on the hard drive in the even there was an issue. One of the drives was defective from the manufacturer and Serverpartdeals/Server Tech Solutions/ServerTech voided the warranty because it had writing on it. Terrible customer service and not even a member of the Better Business Bureau! I would recommend that you order from someone else. Do not give them any business... you have been warned!"

          "Contenu": "They cancelled my order and the only reason was due to being impatient. Let me explain, I ordered 15 enterprise grade hard drives from them for a chia farming build I was working on, and it totaled around $8300 for the drives alone. For that reason, my bank decided to send an eCheck which takes 6-9 days to process. I explained to the merchant the situation and at first they were okay with it. After a few days I get an email from them saying they are no longer able to wait for payment and have cancelled my order.The problem now becomes that the FUNDS have already left my account 2 days prior to this email being sent to me. The money is now in LIMBO until the final day when it arrives to them, and then they issue me a refund. They were unable to issue me a refund at first because the funds never did arrive. So I had to wait for them to receive the funds even after the cancellation and then I had to wait again... for it to return to my bank account. Yes, I have a credit card, but for large purchases this goes over my cap that I have set on it for security reasons. If anybody knows anything about crypto or farming... timing is of the essence and although the first 6-9 days was my fault for choosing eCheck, they made me wait double time for the money to come back to me before I could use it else where."

Instead of honoring it, they canceled my order and offered to sell me the NIC at $425 instead of the $50 they had listed on their page. I ordered from them because they were the cheapest on the particular part. Thanks to this my upgrade project will be behind schedule. That isn't their fault but it's quite the inconvenience. I dislike a company who won't honor their listed prices and feels like a bait and switch. Larger companies are usually required to uphold their listed price, mistake or not and unfortunately this company will not. I will say their team (name removed for privacy) was kind enough to call me to let me know that they have canceled and was kind enough to check to see if they had used parts. But in the end I won't deal with a company who won't uphold the price which they have listed."

Drives:  The drives I received were HPE pulls (as annotated by the HPE sticker on each) and aren't covered under Seagate's warranty (checked on Seagate's warranty verification and showed that they are OEM drives not covered by Seagate). I contacted serverpartdeals inquiring about the warranty and received a prompt response stating that I have a 3 year warranty through serverpartdeals.  In case anyone is interested in S.M.A.R.T data, all drives passed and had low hours ~50 on them and all drives had a manufacture date of around May 2018 (+ or - a month).TL:DR, Excellent price on drives and service, warranty not through Seagate, but through serverpartdeals.  Would totally be 5 stars if the store page was more clear about who provides the warranty and I will buy from Serverpartdeals again in the future."

Great service too for all the questions I had related to picking the right drives for my application! Thanks!"

This time I got seller refurbished with no OEM warranty, meaning I have to trust the seller to take care on the off chance a drive dies. This is a whole new level of trust! The drives arrived well packed, as the last time, and the free shipping is ultra fast (on par if not beating my favorite red and green NY photo and video store). The refurb drives all have precisely 72 hours on the clock and vacuum sealed in anti-static bags. SMART data indicates no issues, and I'm running extended tests that will take a couple days. I will be sure to update this review if there are any issues. So far 2 out of 2 happy purchases of multiple drives."

          "Contenu": "Purchased several WD HC320 datacenter HDDs from Serverpartdeals through Amazon US in 2020 for a respectable price, individual HDDs came in correct WD official box with plastic 'GeoSprings' & sealed ESD bag (I've had issues with official Amazon Commercial Services shipping bare drives in poorly padded envelopes resulting in damage). HDDs worked perfectly however unfortunately one of them failed after after a year and a bit of use (5 year warranty). Contacted Serverpartdeals support with details and was able to RMA the drive for a replacement, replacement HDD was shipped quickly upon receipt of the old drive, again well packed and the correct model replacement, works great."
