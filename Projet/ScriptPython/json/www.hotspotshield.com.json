I called support and they said that they would not deal with me until I could prove that I had paid for the service.  I tried to find the documentation but no luck.  A few days ago I received a notice from Apple that I was going to be charged for another year from them.  The reason I had no credit card documentation was that it was done through the Apple Store.  I found the documentation and sent it to them canceling the extension and asking for a refund for the previous 4 months where they did not provide the service.   They responded with instructions on how to reinstate the software without able to log in.   The product is ok but the technical support, billing and attitude are terrible."

Sure, if you want to read a text website, it would work. But since when are text websites using geolocation to block viewership? Since never. The real service is video streaming, and hotspotshield is just too slow to provide this. I always know when Hotspotshield accidentally turns itself on, because none of my websites load. It's pathetic really. I paid for 1 year, and can't use this 'service'. I mainly wanted to use it to watch TV while abroad (abc.com etc)It also does work ok with torrents, where the slowdown is not as noticeable, though I barely use torrents myself.I have a great wired Internet, 50 Mbs download, 20 upload, and it is exactly that when I test my speed. Doing a speed test when hotspot shield is on is a joke (again), the speedtest reports way lower speeds than even shown on hotspotshield interface (which are dismal at best). Don't buy it, unless all you need is to browse the web with no video/audio, or for torrenting. Plus, if you get a yearly subscription you'll still be getting ads, namely their advertisements for a 'lifetime subscription'. Thanx, I'll pass."

          "Contenu": "We have tested a VPN vendor, which has a special relationship with US authorities and secret services: HotspotShield.There were of course many questions, why one offer a VPN service as anonymization, but which is quite openly supported by US secret service circles. This requires understanding the logic. Many citizens in the US continue to think that the authorities want to do good things for them, and undoubtedly this is true. Whether we as Europeans want to trust this after all the information we have since Edward Snowdens documents about this also a service, is another question!\"The Hotspotshield users trust in the protection of foreigners' privacy by US authorities.\"This is why this review differs a little from our usual format. We have also received no technical answers to our written inquiries to Hotspotshield. Much of what we could discover has confirmed our assumptions. There are clear connections to US intelligence NSA and the FBI! And in the end, every user should be aware of the potential of \"monitoring\"Looking at the responsible managers of HotspotShield, the proximity and connections with the US authorities reveals:    Alec Ross    He was a technological advisor to Hillary Clinton when she was a member of the US government and at that time also supported the attempt and start of international surveillance on the Internet by the NSA directly with the US government.    Reed E. Hundt    He was chairman of the United States Federal Communications Commission under Bill Clinton as President of the US and thus presumably significantly involved in the expansion of the NSA surveillance measures at that time.    Dr. Peter Hoag    He was also a co-founder of a CIA subsidiary, Cardinal Technologies , which sought technological unification of data transmissions in the US networks. Cardinal Technologies was also a consultant to some US-friendly governments in Europe and is probably still working for US-based intelligence services.    Kevin Cook    He is still in the management of the Barracuda Network , which became known through their \"backdoors\" on the hard drives and firewall ingloriously.    Rick Roth    Is known as a national adviser to the US authorities for corporate networks in the USA and is regarded as a liaison between national interests and corporate interests in the USA.    Doug Maine    He worked for IBM as a financial manager. IBM itself is known for the cooperation with US authorities also became international espionage and was banished from China among other things.    Greg Coleman    He has worked in a number of US-based corporations in senior editorial offices such as AOL, Huffington Post, and some online media houses, all of which provide US government-friendly reporting, as well as public opinion, as well as circumvention of government encryption.    Reference : All persons are also listed as managers and managers of the operating company \" AnchorFree.com - Team \" of HotSpotShield.The list of allegedly \"US government delegates\" to Hotspotshield could be extended even further. It is rather unlikely to assume that all of these people have suddenly committed themselves to protecting the privacy and anonymity of international users. A public stand for \"freedom and democracy\" does not necessarily mean a respectful approach to the privacy of non-US citizens. What is meant by freedom, whether this is only for US citizens or for each user is to use the hotspotshield, remains unclear. Even if many of these people state this as the main argument for your commitment yourself!The \"Goldman Sachs Group\" finances the company!Anyone who installs HotspotShield may also become part of the \"US strategy for international surveillance on the Internet\".Hotspotshield can also be called\"Trojans with voluntary self-installation of the users!\"understand.What sounds ironic at first sight, however, has a serious background. Because the technical components of the service allow it to monitor the users much better than without the use of the case. With allegedly 400 million installations on PC`s worldwide, Hotspotshield can be a quite interesting factor in the strategy to monitor the entire world on the Internet!Technical conditions also allow targeted monitoring.In our test, we have installed the application on a specially prepared Windows PC. In addition to the usual VPN connection certificates, access certificates were also installed. In this case it would be technically possible to connect to the user's PC without warning or to send different data to decoded servers without being requested. The data transmission would be encrypted as well, and the user can hardly provide any proof of this.The communication of the company suggests protection of one's privacy, anonymity and security! It is important, however, that potential users are also aware of the dangers that may arise.Freedom and protection for Turkish oppositionists! But turns out to be a Trojan horse with US support! Possibly to consciously undermine freedom of expression!Particularly bad in our view, it is also, since Hotspotshield in the last years also massively and specifically in Turkey was advertised. This should obviously lead to government-critical activists to trust this service. As a Turkish journalist recently reported on Twitter, he was charged with government criticism and he had always used Hotspotshield.    \"Turkish authorities detain VOA & BBC reporters, adding to 145 journalists already in jails in Turkey -world's largest prison for journalists Twitter \"Meanwhile, however, the use of Hotspotshield within Turkey has been blocked."

          "Contenu": "Update 1/5/2023:After submitting the review below on 12/29/2022 I was contacted by customer support at Hotspot and issued a refund for the double charged amount.  The staff was quick to respond, and more than happy to help.  The explanation given with regards to why the customer service rep initially only offered a partial refund was lack of training, but I think that more realistically the factors leading to such a discrepancy are the communication model and lack of agency for front line employees.  I had excellent service from the initial rep who tried to help me, but they were constrained by the policies of the company.  The next interaction with staff was from a management level, and it seemed like they had more agency to resolve issues that aren't spelled out in policy verbatim.  It is unfortunate that not being able to speak to someone on the phone initially forced me to leave a bad review before getting connected to someone that had the ability to fix the problem.  I do acknowledge the lack of diligence on my end toward noticing that I was being charged for a service I had already purchased.  However according to the staff:  it shouldn't be something that can happen, and they're looking into how to keep it from happening in the future.  Original reivew:The product is good, but it\u2019s easy to be double charged.  The company lets you pay via several different auto-renew avenues (direct, via Apple subscriptions\u2026etc) and does not prevent a customer from signing up multiple times for the same account.  There was  difficulty even confirming that I had been paying more than once for the same service.  In addition, they cite a \u201c45-day\u201d limit to dispute any charges.  Essentially I had initially paid for a yearly subscription, and on top of that purchase I erroneously was able to sign up for a monthly subscription for the same service.  Eventually I was able to get a credit onto my account for the double charges, but that was not initially offered\u2026I was initially only offered 1 months refund for a double charge over the course of 12 months.  Once again, the product is good, but the communication and refund policies are not easy to navigate."

I will continue to access this Application with it being a great success for me to avoid being tracked (Geo)via the social network drama created by the networks that are broadcasting rumors about me I have never been to once currently,     I hope the cyber crimes units in this country are able to pin point the MAC ID device numbers etc. to identify the perpetrators,an cause their devices to no longer function correctly or become obsolete when intentionally doing so.
