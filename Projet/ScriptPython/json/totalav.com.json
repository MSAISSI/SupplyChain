I am not the only one having this problem with this unauthorized and hidden install by TotalRV, google 'how to remove pesky totalav popup' and you will find many such complains.

This is happening a week before Xmas when i REALLY need that money for Family and Grandchildren! And WHY are there no telephone numbers to ring? It's impossible to get hold of these people and to talk to an actual human being who will look into the issue for you! They obviously don't  want the hassle of having to bother with people and their problems otherwise they would make it easier to get hold of them. I will NEVER use this company for my virus software!  I think they're far too devious to trust."

When reviewing my bank statements, I found numerous charges (at different time and amounts) all from this company. After taking days to finally getting in touch with an actual human, instead of trying to help resolve the issues surrounding their software's inability to protect from malware, they just offered a refund of the overcharges.  When I asked them how about resolving the malware issues your software didn't catch, the service rep hung up on me. Further the software places adds promoting different modules you can buy to further protect your computers for additional charges. These all seem mostly related to internet browser security and email protection and are seen everytime you open an internet browser. Very disappointed."

I am now on hour 4 with remote tech support trying to resolve the issue, and it looks like it's going to be even longer. It seems to have a large margin of error in discerning if a threat is actual or not. On the safer side it gets the less obvious security risks. On the downside you could lose hours of work time trying to resolve how to get important missing files back.Edit. Changed it to one star, because total av doesn't even have proper customer support to even discuss this matter as after 9 hours of trying to fix my computer. After going through different tech supports It went no where. Double Edit: you better hope you never have any issues. They won't do a damn thing for you. Even canceling and getting a refund was like pulling teeth.To anyone that reads this, just go with Norton."

I sent multiple emails to multiple addresses and received the same generated response. I called the phone number and was merely directed to the website. Essentially, I was left without answers and couldn't access my free account without purchasing the paid version of TotalAV.I am frustrated with the lack of genuine communication. At the very least, TotalAV needs an actual person to respond to emails and/or phone calls. While its antivirus is well reviewed, I've found that TotalAV doesn't get the simple things right, namely customer service, which is concerning for interested buyers."

The message from Total was install our software from a clean operating system install or it may not work.

          "Contenu": "After the 1st year they tried to auto renew for \u00a3119. . This was my mistake not cancellling auto renewal , which is this companies aim to maximise profits.Please offer your customers a reminder that payment is due and will be taken on a auto renewal agreement.After  attempting to take \u00a3119 on a old card payment was refused ,i canceled the auto renewal, where they offererd me the same product for less then \u00a320. Con Merchants AVOID this program .  Cancel auto renewal immediatly.Please google TOTALAV to see honest reviews , reviews here are a little inconsistent.IN RESPONCE TO TOTALAV CUSTOMER SERVICEThere was no email delivered last month  confirming a renwel charge-THIS IS A LIE and not acceptable You(totalav) , not i , ticked the box for  for auto renewl - This is a scam too ,this box should be left unticked , but you auto tick it knowing that 2nd year is where you make your money.Overall i advise anyone not to get this app.They did not scam me for a \u00a3119 renewl charge , and i am lucky , many others have to fight to get this renewl charge back and by law they must return the charge.If you do recieve this charge you have limited time to act (consumer rights), immediatly contact your bank or card provider and dispute payment, Immediatly contact  TotalAv and cancel subcription and request payment back.Please google this company for honest reviews before subscibing/installing to, they are not reputable."

Their solution wasn't much help either.With all the troubles, asked for a refund.Followed all their instructions and kept getting emails, that I had to verify it. Again followed their instructions, which just led myself to a web page to purchase Total AV, nothing to cancel, except for what I had already done. Took a few weeks before this was sorted out.Why do they make it soo difficult to cancel???"

A few days ago they billed me $119 (almost 4 times the original price???) through PayPal via automatic payments. I never received notification or I would have immediately cancelled - I also never authorized automatic payments with this company. I disputed it with PayPal and they denied it because I didn't cancel ahead of time. I checked my account and there must have been 40 business that were under recurring payments - 3 were legit that I set up - the rest were one time purchases. TotalAV are scammers and PayPal are enablers."

(About \u00a330) At the end of the introductory year they took just over \u00a3118 from my account with no warning and without telling me how much I would pay. I sucked this up but decided to cancel at the end of the year. When I tried to so this I was offered another \u00a330 ish year. They then took more than that from my account and I had to request a refund. So, this year I decided to cancel again and was given an offer for 2.99 a month. I accepted this but did not receive a confirmation email. Today I received an email from them saying that 158 euros would be taken from my account. I decided I had had enough of their ineptitude and tried to cancel for once and for all. Now, this post is already long enough so I won\u2019t go through all the steps I had to take but, in total, it took about an hour and a quarter and lots of stress before I was finally able to do this!So, just a word of caution to anyone who is considering using Total AV."

Connected with their tech support who had no idea why the alerts kept popping up despite that nothing of their software 'totalav' was found in my applications (reminder: I did not download nor installed so it was unauthorized access). Their tech support had no idea how to remove the annoying notifications every 5-10 mins and asked that I bring my Mac to a local tech geek. Sadly, it's like welcoming a 'thief' who then says they are protecting your PC. So many of the anti virus nowadays are this 'self fulfilling prophecy' ploy so be careful. Look for reputable ones - check who owns the company and locations."

I was more than happy to give it a go for that price, believing that if I wasn't satisfied with it, it wasn't very much to lose.Imagine my horror when later in the day I received a communication from my bank warning me of possible fraud because they were querying not just the \u00a31.99 but a further \u00a339.00 for another product, of which I knew nothing. According to TotalAV I had agreed to buy a subscription for Safe Browsing (VPN) as well, where both were subscriptions that were due to be renewed at a later date.Fortunately, my bank was on the ball. After a short conversation where they informed me that they were unable to stop the payments, they gave me a phone number that allowed me to contact to the accounts department of TotalAV directly, and that I should speak to them about cancelling. To be fair to TotalAV I spoke to a very helpful and polite gentleman who eventually cancelled all payments and subscriptions with the promise of a refund within 48 hours. However, he did offer other other services for free or reduced rates which I politely declined. I told him that a bond of trust between myself and his company had been broken.On reading the reviews, it appears that the management response  in most cases is to assure it's clients that all costs will be refunded - and so far I have no reason to deny this. However I have yet to read a response that explains why they sign people up by stealth for services they haven\u2019t asked for.I am interested to find out and await response.For your information the direct number to their accounts department is 0800357602."

          "Contenu": "I recently had an unfortunate experience with TotalAV and felt compelled to share my dissatisfaction. I purchased their antivirus program for 29.0 euros, but due to a confusing website interface, I unintentionally subscribed to additional features, incurring extra charges of 170 euros.When I reached out to their customer care, the experience was appalling. The first agent was dismissive and unhelpful, insisting that I would not be charged beyond the initial 29.0 euros. Subsequently, my bank flagged suspicious transactions attempting to charge the additional 170 euros.Upon contacting customer care again, the second agent, after an unusually long conversation, conveniently ended the chat, claiming it was due to a system error. This felt like a deliberate attempt to avoid addressing the issue. My attempts to seek resolution through customer care have been a nightmare and made my lose any trust in this company. And after reading the reviews on this website-which I wish I had done previously!-I decided to have my account cancelled and request a refund for the 29.0 euros. The third agent I spoke to was even worse! She treated me as if I were unreasonable for seeking a refund for a money they never received according to her! And to make matters worse, she unilaterally ended the chat, leaving me without any resolution except for \"Check with your bank and call us again\"!The Help Center and live chat proved to be utterly useless, redirecting me in circles without resolving the problem. The lack of transparency and unhelpful customer service have left me deeply dissatisfied.I hope others can learn from my experience, and I strongly advise potential customers to exercise caution. The company's inability to address and resolve customer issues reflects poorly on their commitment to customer satisfaction."

Was told to log in at startup screen Sent me screen shot of start up screen but my startup screen does not have the login. I have to go to the General  screen to see my startup link and that shows that I am signed in.Next they suggested that I may have the wrong version of totalav. Suggested that I download and install Pro version of Total Av and sign in. I cannot find any version labeled as Total AV Pro.  Tried to acess thru chat. Clicked icon but only got spinning icon. Never connected. No way to contact them by phone or email regarding tech/install issues. Couldn't even respond to them directly to their response for more support.  Had to come back to trust pilot to continue the dialog.Not a happy camper.12/04/2023 TotalAV responded with the same response - make sure I am logged in. I have confirmed. Both times that on my end I am showing as logged in contrary to what it says at TOTAV\u2019s end. I can scan for viruses despite what Totav is saying. But I can\u2019t get rid of all their pop up ads which is my original request. The inability of the Tech staff to comprehend my issues and respond with a fix makes me believe that this app is just as bad as others have said. Maybe the app is good, but the support sucks.

My advice is to look very carefully at what you get for you initial payment. In my opinion it is very little. The other problem is if you want anything to work you have to agree to give total control to Total AV and they actually warn you against doing that. Will not be renewing at the end of my term."

TotalAV tried a total of five times to take money through my PayPal to my bank account. My bank and I first thought it was fraud, so they closed my debit card. I went to totalav and canceled it, once I realized it was on automatic billing. This did not work. They billed PayPal. I called them and told them thus, and was told they did not see a cancelation, so cancelled it and I emailed them back the cancelation request I received. I was told my money would be refunded to PayPal. No such thing happened. PayPal took the $119 out of my account. I was also charged a $29 overdraft fee for those times totalav tried to take money. On top of that, I was charged $66 for an international call to to totalav, because the online cancelation did not work. I have been charged a total of $214 for this delema l! We experience a medical emergency and a pay cut recently, so this money has taken away groceries and doctor bills for us. I am more than upset with this company's billing practice. I feel that it is sneaky. I want my money back!"

Their operating systems is not very clear, or maybe it\u2019s just my ignorance however when I go to the icon & open up Total AV, go into my account info.  It shows my devices & that I\u2019m protected, yet there is a Download Now button there?  This to me, is confusing.  I purchased Total AV Premium because I don\u2019t have home Wi-Fi & have to run my laptop on an open network. Last week  my Facebook account was froze due to inappropriate content being posted.  Because this was \u2018out of the norm\u2019 I was contacted by FB that someone had hacked my account & that they had froze the account until I was able to retrieve it.  Upon investigating this I also discovered unfamiliar devices logged into my Google & my Apple account. By fault of my own, due to a billing issue, I had a lapse in my coverage from Total AV for a couple of days & I am assuming this happened during the lapse of coverage.  I am definitely not very cybersecurity savvy, however I don\u2019t understand how, I have 3 separate devices: cell phone, an IPad an an Apple Laptop, all 3 with Total AV Premium installed & running on them, have run scans & I have not received at least an alert from Total AV.  How is this possible & is this not what the protection is for?  I do not blame Total AV for this, due to my coverage lapse, however I feel this should have been detected."

Very bad, BE CAREFUL with these people!!After the answer of them, I checked their claim again about having sent me a reminder. Nothing! Not in my spam, not in my account....They have reimbursed the subscription, so I updated to 2 stars. I still do not agree with their way of conducting business and stating that you get a discount when you first come to them and later you get billed an enormous amount....but after cancelling/complaining again a big discount.

          "Contenu": "My mother acquired a TotalAv subscription in the hopes that a paid antivirus would work well and serve her purposes. However, after a first small payment, the company upped the amount and after a year or two, were charging a much much higher rate.We wrote an email as requested on the website's terms and conditions, only to receive responses that totally ignored our requests. Sometimes they were simply warning us that a computer without their anti-virus was vulnerable, another time they offered us some reductions, together with some free offers, but they never acknowledged our request to have a refund and cancel the contract.This continued for various emails, both ignoring our requests to cancel the contract and our requests for a refund.So this is a warning: the anti-virus may even be effective but the customer care is appalling. Likewise, beware that if you sign up you may be faced with an automatic renewal that you aren't requested and also may see the price of the contract spiral upwards. Finally, our case is not alone. There are many, many other reviews of cases online (TrustPilot, BestBusinessBureau, Reddit), that describe exactly the same situation, ie NO cancellation and NO refund.Beware!*EDIT: since I last wrote, TotalAV have infact refunded most or all of the money spent on the rather high subscription. For this reason, I am upping my review from 1 to 2 stars."

I also did it because I don't want anyone else to be caught off guard.First things first, Total AV is a good antivirus program which never gives me trouble and the troubles I had were easy enough to fix.The problem is with billing. The first two years were alright but in the third year the bill was to high and I'm not talking about higher than than sign up bonus which would be normal, I'm talking about higher than the \"normal\" rate promised on the website. Instead of paying 117,81 \u20ac like in my second year for the antivirus pro suscribtion, they tried to charge me \u20ac141.61. After talking to costumer support, they offered me an discount of 85%. Only paying the regular price would have been fine with me. Last year they charged me for \u20ac149,00. This was after they promised the year before they weren't going to this. I tried to reason with them again, but this time I didn't get a refund as they said they would terminate my suscribtion. The end of the story is that I had to terminate my suscribtion this year myself because they tried to charge me \u20ac165.41. Let's see how this goes.To summerize:- Good antivirus program- Be careful around billing time, because they charge you more than the suscribtion amount and try to bury the new prices, which are vastly different from the ones posted online, in the lower sections of an E-Mail."

I spent some time talking to the fraud and retail arms of my bank, they confirmed that this company had taken 3 payments instead of the single one authorised. I emailed the company who said they would refund within 7 days. But they did nor argue or present any explanation of why the payments had been taken. At the very least I felt the company's financial operations are sloppy, and therefore have no confidence in their general ability to keep me safe and happy. So I have cancelled all their services and now use a competitor. This hasn't prevented an incessant stream of aggravating advertising to persuade me to rejoin them. All I can say is that their business model and protocols for customer service are not for me, and many others on these pages agree."

          "Contenu": "For the average person - Be aware TotalAV will use deceptive marketing tactics to suggest that everything is included in the 'pro' version, when in fact it is not, and then strongly imply you must buy a bunch of extras. The purchase options for these are bright green labelled as \"activate X\" and \"activate Y\" - for time poor people it looks as though you are activating included extras, when in fact you are purchasing extra; so a $19 deal suddenly becomes $119 on automatic subscription. If you try to cancel, it requires multiple emails, logins and following various email links, with multiple confirmation steps (one of more honestly could be easily missed for the less savvy).....Sneaky tactics undermine what otherwise I'm told should have been a good product, put me right off these guys for future. And yes these tactics are common and used in many places, but seriously, it's been a rough time globally, it's time to be the bigger guy and give the average consumer who's just trying to get by an F-ing break."

          "Contenu": "I feel like I have been scammed. I searched the web for \u201cBest antivirus \u201c and this company came out with lots of Trusst Pilot 4+ stars and an apparently great rating. Then I went to their website and they tricked me into buying a much more expensive product than I wanted or needed. I kept trying to just buy the one computer, one antivirus solution which would have cost me an affordable \u00a345. However, every time I tried to check-out, the message on the screen told me that \u201cfor only \u00a339\u201d\u2026 , I could have extra security and features, which I \u201cmust\u201d need and the pricing is deceptive\u2026.as if they had priced the first main antivirus at \u00a344 and the second, \u201cmust have\u201d at \u00a340 they would be same total price, but at the prices they showed, it tricks you into thinking that you won\u2019t be paying so much (\u2026. Just a total of \u00a380!! ). Then, I found it difficult to find the information about Unsubscribe and having read some of the reviews here about how people found that even when they unsubscribed they were still charged, I am not confident that I won\u2019t be charged. Edit: Additionally, after managing to unsubscribe, I was sent repeated emails that told me that I would no longer be covered if I didn\u2019t re-subscribe! (I paid for a full years cover so It isn\u2019t like I am saying I will not pay my monthly subscription). And, the company want my personal details (an email sent via the TrustPilot site to me, stated that unless I filled in the form with my personal details, my review here would be taken down. ! I really feel that it just doesn\u2019t benefit anyone if one takes the time to write a fact based, honest review that happens to be negative and states why the negative review has been written. Now, I am worrying that my personal details may be used by this company for nefarious purposes. How does any person with who is struggling with the minefield that is computer protection, cope ? Not everyone has access to more computer literate children, or IT department personnel who can advise. I looked up the consumer body, \u2018Which\u2019 and couldn\u2019t even find this company listed in their \u201cBest Antivirus \u201c reviews, so I feel that I have been unduly swayed by looking at the \u2018Trust Pilot\u2019 reviews that this company plastered all over their advertising on the web search page. Additionally, I do not want to install this AV on my computer after reading negative reviews here about how difficult it has been for those people in said reviews, to remove the program from their computers. Conclusion: I have just spent \u00a380 for nothing. I wish I had simply given it to a charity, as they would have benefitted. Yes, I should have researched more thoroughly before I spent the money, but I do feel that their advertising and their sign up page were very deceptive and persuasive, unlike some other very good products, that Which magazine praise for their products and because they have free antivirus software that works very well (unless you are browsing indiscriminately or do need a more comprehensive program)."

Because they have my email therefore they can spam whenever they want. They should not be allowed. Just a few weeks ago pushing again Total Adblock. At the time I didn\u2019t remembered I already have it and I bought it again. A couple of days later when I check the bill which is located on their site, after login their site under billing section you can see what you have. Later that day I complained and I ask for a refund. They ask me information, and I give to them invoice number which is at their site. They came back, they cannot find the invoice. I check it myself, invoice was not there, it appears it is deleted. After 5-6 days later they are still looking to find it. Now needless to say only Antivirus is working all the other futures are VPN, Adblock, Identy Protection are gone. They cannot find the invoice.They reinstated my position, everything is working as it should as of December 13. By the way they refund the money as well. thanks"

As other people have found they are useless, in fact I don\u2019t think \u201cthey\u201d are people as I got the same answers word for word the 3 times I went to their site. I suspect they are using a computer to answer standard questions.  In the end I gave up and decided to ditch the product.  So to summarise a good product until you have a problem and then it\u2019s useless.  Postscript - after posting my review I received a reply from Support and my renewal was sorted, so that was good. Still didn't solve why software wouldn't run so I just uninstalled it and then re-installed, and .... it worked fine."

          "Contenu": "I may be old fashioned, but I like to have the freedom to renew my licenses manually and not via auto-renewal unless I have specifically chosen to do so myself. Thus, I bought the 19 Euro offer and then turned of auto-renewal in my account (which was quite easy). One thing that I didn't like is that some of the functionality is turned off only because you change the way to renew the license \u2013 they were included in the 19 Euro deal. After all changing the way to pay does not mean that I will not renew \u2013 if I think the program does a good job.This is an email I received today:\u201cSome time ago, you chose to deactivate your automatic renewal of your TotalAV service. After November 14, 2024, you will no longer be able to access your account.Not only that, but in 48 hours, you'll also lose all the additional services you've received, at no extra cost, as part of our great Continuous Protection package.\u201dOther malware scanners (like Malware bytes)  detects total av as a malware, which is a bit concerning (although it could be a way to try to get rid of a competitor). Some sites consider total av as a scam, or rogue programs (including Wikipedia), why it is hardly surprising that many people are skeptical about the program.It would be good to get comments/explanations from TotalAV Customer Care Team or someone else at the company concerning the scam/rogue accusations. Even Wikipedia can be wrong of course. And things can have changed since 2019, when the Wikipedia article was written.Added 11/22/2023After reading the answer from the Customer Care Team I am not much wiser. The answer is almost identical to every other answer they have given. I wanted them to comment on their classifications as a rough company/software by wikipedia (check their \"List_of_rogue_security_software\"), and other sites and forums that has classified them as scam. Thus it becomes kind of nonsensical to ask for my phone number and additional email info, (I gave trustpilot my email to begin with). The answers are robotic/AI-like.I was also unpleasantly surprised by a mail from trustpilot where they tell me that my review may be deleted within two day's unless I comply with total ai:s requests (i.e. giving them additional contact details). That is also odd as I gave them three stars and wrote that I may well renew my license depending on my experience of the software over the coming year. By the way this is what trustpilot wrote to me:\"TotalAV would love to understand your experience better, so they\u2019ve asked for more details about your review\u2014like an order number or email.If we don\u2019t hear from you within 3 days, your review may be taken offline.\"I assume they don't do that with five-star reviews..."

No longer need personal anti-vac as back under company scheme, so with 6-months left on my 'service' plan, I tried to cancel and ideally get a refund for those months.  The 2 email addresses I had on joining correspondence and which I was advised to use bounced back, so I went on the website and tried to cancel there, it took some time to find a page which wasn't FAQ info.  On the page where I could act, the verification code never appeared in my email, and told me that I couldn't re-try and to wait 2 mins.  This I did and the same message appeared, so I went to the 'livechat' bot who then passed me to someone who confirmed they were human.  The responses were very slow and the first 20 mins were frustrating as all they did was encourage me not to cancel.  They gave me a new verification code and tried to cease the chat.  I told them to remain on line which was smart on my part because the code didn't work.  They gave me another number which did, the cancellation process then started and took me to screens offering me ever increasing discounts to renew next year which as I refused went up each time I declined.  The final one was 60% off - this exceeded the 50% refund I was requesting for leaving 6 months into the annual contract.  Got back to livechat and she asked me what further discount I would accept to stay.  I pointed out that they were now offering me a discount that exceeded my refund request, so give me the refund.  She refused again, matter closed. 45 mins of my time for an over-lengthy process that jaded my view of TotalAV.  It wasn't about not getting a refund it was the number of barriers put in the way to cancelling.  The refund policy is 30 days after renewal for a 12 month plan.  Had I known I would not be working from home any more in May/June I could have got a refund and had I tried to leave at this years auto-renewal I would have only paid 40% of what I did.  Be smart and use this information to get a better deal if you join and want to renew."

I wonder about Ad Block because I still see a lot of ad pop-ups at various times, especially about TotalAV products! Another concern I have is that it seems sometimes it is difficult for the Customer Service group (mostly in India that I've spoken with) to understand my concerns or questions.  Therefore it has taken two or three calls to get my concern answered.Another concern is that the charges for software vary all over the place.  Therefore is quite possible not to know what a charge is for when you first see it on your credit card.Lastly, I don't like that I can't get a refund on a product that I have not installed or used at all (confirmed by TotalAV), only because the time lapse is more than a two or three months since I purchased the product."

When I described my issues in a post here, a few weeks ago, including the additional software download, nobody told me that could be the problem.  I deleted the second program and reinstalled TotalAV, added their Total Adblock, and their software seems to be doing the trick. Everything installed - and so far no more annoying \"virus warning popups.\"  So, I'm quite happy with their program. My only issue is that I had to do my own problem solving and after a month or so I still never had a direct email address, or helpline phone number."
