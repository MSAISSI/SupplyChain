Not even any kind of \"thank you for your service\". You people should be ashamed. At one point I asked my comment to be sent to the owner of the company....again no response. I chatted with someone and in the end they said \"Is there anything else i can do for you today\"? I said how about a \"thank you for my service\". He replied \"thank you for using PDFfiller\". This company rips off Veterans and not once do they recognize Veterans for their service. This compny is anti-American,You won't find me using their services."

          "Titre": "\"Free trial\" is not really free when credit card information is required",
          "Contenu": "The software looked interesting and intuitive but I will not be able to find out if the saved document would be delivered with the proper quality i.e. no compression of images such as logos because pdfFiller requires users to create an account and provide credit card information before being able to download the finished document. \"Free trial\" is not really free when you have to give credit card information and go back in to cancel your subscription. Whatever rationale companies provide for requiring such information is doubtful at best. I would argue that the real freeloaders are those companies who hope users will forget to cancel their subscription. A recent survey (May 2022) from C+R Research found that 42% of consumers forgot they are still paying for a subscription they no longer use. It is more likely to be the main reason behind that practice rather than to prevent service abuse as there are other ways to authenticate someone without a credit card number. pdfFiller gets two stars for subscribing to this doubtful practice.Edit: To be clear, it is not immediately obvious that you must elect to take the \"free\" trial which is a small tab amongst many others. The landing page would let you edit your pdf document before any notice about the free trial would appear. You might only realize that you must subscribe to a \"free\" trial once you spent quite a few minutes editing your document and tried to download it."

It is missing an Education Plan that should be free for all that applies for this plan. Students should be able to have this feature available to them to create or edit Homework. All they have to do is sign in using their school account. Why am I saying this? Because I'm a student that needs a PDF Editor really badly for my Homework. And I bet that's even more people out there that need this as well.If they add that feature in PDF Editor, I'll make this rating from 2 stars to 5 stars.Overall, PDF Filler is great and has fantastic features, but lacks the feature that I mentioned above. AND THAT'S A NEED not a want.By the way, I just started using PDF Filler about 4 days ago so I might not know that there IS an edu feature."

They charged my credit card on the 30th day, early in the morning at 1AM.  I signed up for the \"free trial\" on August 11th.  August 31st would have been \"20 days\" and September 10th would have been \"30 days.\"  Instead, I saw that they had charged my card on September 10th (the last day of my \"free trial\").Had they not pulled this \"fast one\" (i.e., had they charged my card on the 31st day, instead of on the 30th day of the \"free trial\")... I may have considered keeping them for the year, because they do provide a decent product.  However, once they pulled this \"fast one\" on me, I decided not to continue the subscription.Now, the question is... will I actually get my refund (credit to my card)?  Let's see what \"nut roll\" they put me through for that.  I did receive a confirmation email of the refund, so that's good, but need to go back to confirm in \"5 to 7 days.\"Advice to PDFFiller corporation... don't advertise \"Free 30-day Trial\" when you end up charging the customer on the 30th day.  That's really what pissed me off and had me cancel my subscription.  It's a poor business practice and makes your corporation look tricky and unprofessional."

          "Contenu": "There are several clunky features I did not like.  (1) My first issue was that when editing text, the font would change from Times New Roman to Arial within the edit box.  The user had to \"tell\" the computer to switch back to Times New Roman.(2) Another issue I spotted is that if I want to italicize ONE word on a line of text, the entire line will become italicized.  This was cured by deleting the italicized word, then creating a separate text box with the italicized word in it.  The italic text box was dropped into the line of text with the plain text around it.(3) When editing text, the size of text will drop down a size or two.  The writer must \"bump\" up the text size with the upward arrow to get it to match the text in the original document.Otherwise, I like using PDFfiller.  Of course, PDF editing is not as simple as ordinary word editing.   Or perhaps PDF editing gets easier after continual practice."

This just happened minutes ago and I was up working on a project so I immediately responded. Surprisingly somebody answered the phone at the company. I was able to refer them to my account they could see where I had stopped the service immediately upon testing it because it didn't fit all of my requirements this all happened last month however as a young lady told me the cancellation process takes several steps and somewhere during that process the cancellation was not 100% completed. However she sees where I never utilized the service I did cancel it she immediately moved into action return the payment that was incorrectly processed and was super helpful and super friendly. The Reps name was Sally I am super impressed with not only her but PDF filler because of the fact that they honored my displeasure and something like I said through the process fell through the cracks however I was able to contact them they were able to easily see what was happening with my account and rectify my complaint. I want to vote the company a plus plus because nowadays service is not even a thing anymore it seems rarely can you find a company that stands behind their product and they do so by providing support Saturday morning at 5:00 a.m. LOL so yeah I was super pleased with the service although they did not provide what I was looking for the company still will always be on my good list in terms of consideration in case in the future they do provide the needs that I have. A+ Plus"
