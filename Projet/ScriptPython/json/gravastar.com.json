          "Contenu": "Purchased their P5 headphones just a bit over a year ago for a review. When reviewed, everything was great. Sound was amazing, build quality was on par. But then I started having problems with muffled audio. I always kept them charged, cleaned, and stored. I hadn't used them more than a handful of times through the year. Now i am only days past the warranty date, but a defective product is still a defective product. I reached out to customer service(ABSOLUTELY GARBAGE, FIX YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE AGENTS) and was basically told I'm screwed, buy another pair. No solution was offered other than \"it's out of warranty. But we are selling the headphones at a discount right now if you are interested\" I get being out of warranty, but the only solution you offer is basically to tell us to screw off and purchase another one? Take care of your customers, and your customers will take care of you. I have already removed my positive review video off of YouTube and I will be posting another shortly to detail this experience to possible future customers. Do better Gravastar.EDIT: After contacting them again as requested here, I GOT THE EXACT SAME RESPONSE. Trying to get me to purchase another pair. Congratulations, you lost a customer."

          "Contenu": "I ordered a pair of headphones from them which never arrived but tracking information showed them as delivered. They told me that I\u2019d have to take it up with the couriers as once it leaves them, it\u2019s not their responsibility. Funnily enough, they used Amazon Logistics to deliver them. When I contacted Amazon Logistics, they told me that I need to speak to the seller as they are responsible for getting the goods to me, not Amazon. The sellers did offer to send me a replacement pair, but wanted to charge me $20 for delivery. I told them that I would not pay the delivery charge as it\u2019s not my fault they never came. They then offered me a refund, minus the original shipping fee. Again I declined saying that they should give me a full refund as it\u2019s not my fault they were not delivered, and I told them I would put a dispute through to Paypal. Unfortunately for me, PayPal took there side in the case I filed as the tracking information provided by Gravastar, shows they were delivered. Even though there is no signature, name taken or photographic evidence of delivery. I\u2019m now stuck with \u00a3105.94 bill that I have to pay. Even though the goods were never received, AND I have witnesses at work who will confirm that they did not come. I\u2019ve emailed them several times as Amazon Logistics said that the seller needs to open a non delivery dispute with them, but now Gravastar are not replying to my emails! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!! DO NOT BUY FROM THEM AND LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE \u2639\ufe0f"

However, given low quality of sound itself this is a disappointing purchase for this price. One should not need 2 speakers for \"spatial feel\", and there is basically no bass at all. Shipping cost me almost 25 pounds as well, so there is that on top. Would not recommend."

For the sake of transparency any tech from any company can sometimes be a little tricky to figure out or might have a hiccup but the customer service and the community really comes together to help when asked. Couldnt ask for more\u2026. But i want more, products i mean!

          "Contenu": "I bought a pair of the Mars Pro speakers, and had an overall very good experience.  The shipping was faster than promised, and the speakers were well packed, so damage in transit is much less likely.  The sound is great, and the speakers themselves seem very well constructed.  Pairing the speakers, both individually or to get stereo sound was reasonably straight-forward.On the downside, the default volume of the shut down sound will disturb people when it's late at night and things are quiet, and there doesn't seem to be any way to change the volume of any of the default sounds.  It would also be nice if Gravastar would offer a 3.5mm output to two speaker usb-c cable, especially as they have a single speaker connector cable in the box.  If you want stereo video, you have to use Bluetooth, and signal lag with video makes it disconcerting to watch video when the sound doesn't match the action, or worse the speakers lips!Based on the purchase experience, excellent sound quality, and their solid construction, I would absolutely recommend them, but in a situation where stereo video is important to you, not so much."

          "Contenu": "I have been using Gravastar speakers and headphones for almost a year now, I own two Mars Pro Aurochs, a pair of Sirius pro and a few months ago I got my hands on the Sirius P5 with all of their cases (except for the Christmas one sadly).The speakers (even one by itself) is Incredible! The sound quality is just mind blowing with a bass so deep it shakes my soul with each beat! The design of the speaker still amazes me to this day; especially with it's colourful RGB effects.The Sirius Pro earbuds were my first true wireless headphones experience, they felt comfortable and secure to wear as I am constantly on the move at work. The case for the earbuds are extremely sturdy with its metal framing so breaking them would be nearly impossible! The sound quality is still brilliant; but I prefer the Sirius P5 as they have fine funes the earbuds into mini portable power houses for your ears! Even the case designs are amazing! Not to mention the community sharing their posts and ideas for redecorating the speakers to fit their style."

Satisfied with the earbuds I also purchased a set of SuperNova speakers which have not only become my go-to portables when I'm out and about but the style constantly has friends, Family and even strangers wanting to know more about them. Shipping was resonably quick despite being half way around the world from me, And any shipping issues and inquiries were handled reasonably quick."

The sound is crystal clear, and has a very deep bass, and is quite loud. And the light settings are bright and effective when being used as a lantern. The shipping took longer than expected and was a little inconsistent with tracking updates, but that's the only downside I can think of. I'd definitely order from them again, and I certainly plan on it!"

As for my sirius pros and alpha 65, i got them in the bundle a little under a week ago. they delivered literally 3 days after i ordered them, and i have been obsessed ever since! the sirius pros are great for travel; my music has never sounded so good. Alpha is my new desk-top buddy, providing fuel to my essential gadgets and looking snazzy all at once! All in all, the aesthetic isn\u2019t the only thing going for this company. Gravastar provides an amazing experience, from excellent customer service to sleek sci-fi tech with rugged and functional designs. The war damaged color does in fact feel as if it has been through a war; the excellent paint and weathering ensures that."
