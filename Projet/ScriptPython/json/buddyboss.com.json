          "Titre": "BuddyBoss - A Nightmare Experience I'd Avoid at All Costs!",
          "Contenu": "I had high hopes for BuddyBoss, but my experience with their software and customer service has been a complete nightmare. The software itself was a struggle to use, and I encountered numerous issues trying to get it to work as expected. Doesn't help that it's on WordPress which is equally frustrating. The customer service team was shockingly unprofessional and unhelpful, making the experience even worse.While their website may look fantastic in theory, the actual product and support are far from it. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone. Additionally, their 14-day trial period is confusing, and if you happen to go even a minute past it, good luck getting any of your money back. They hold onto it like hostages and are not even the slightest bit reasonable in trying to help you out. I used the software for only a couple days. Had issues with my understanding of how to cancel which put me a few days beyond what they consider the trial end and stuck paying for an entire years license I can't even use. Beware! I feel these guys are complete garbage."

          "Contenu": "I purchased the Done For You believing the entire web app was done for you. In fact, they just created the design. No connections, no courses migrated or uploaded, no images, no gamification or quizzes. $2000 for that? You can hire someone on Fiver for a fraction of that price to do that. I asked for a refund within several days after purchasing because they told me they did not do any courses. They had not even started the design, but refused. Then I saw how bad their customer support was through the process which was frightening. It would take days and sometimes almost a week to get a simple response to get the site loaded properly. After seeing that I got scared, what if once the online web app is up and I have any breakdowns how will their customer support respond? Well in fact, if you check here on Trustpilot you can read many reviews of terrible customer support and things breaking for months without a fix. That would severely damage my business so I have taken a $2000 as I will not risk using a product with such terrible customer support."

Ever since the deployment of the app everything has gone down hill. The mobile app has repeatedly crashed and not functioning properly. I have support tickets going back months now and no solution has been reached. My current supper ticket trying to resolve this is nearly 3 months and I have been repeatedly ignored when I have asked to discuss a refund. No clear solution and repeated negative reviews/emails from my customers regarding my platform all due to a failing buddyboss app. I have been really disappointed especially given the positive reviews I see others write. My experience with specifically the DoneForYou app service has been appalling and I do not recommend. As a part of this review I have provided my order email which only BuddyBoss can see as proof of my purchase. I am ~\u00a32000 out of pocket and continuing to apologise to my customers. Do not recommend."

You need to have the skills to pre-handle excuses and gaslighting from BuddyBoss support.PS: While fighting for my case, I wasn't able to use my app fully and I am PAYING during those months. So if you want to save your money - run far away from BuddyBoss."

          "Contenu": "I had high hopes for Buddy Boss, having seen their impressive website, but my experience with their platform and customer service has left me deeply disappointed. In short, I strongly advise against engaging with this company from my experience\"Don't TRUST THEM, THEY WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY AND GIVE YOU TRASH THAT DOESN'T WORK.\" This statement resonates with my experience as well. The LearnDash and Buddy Boss system, while promising on the surface, turned out to be a nightmarish ordeal when it came to backend functionality. During our trial period, I found the process of cancellation confusing, and the company consistently adhered to policies that prevented them from issuing a refund, even when the product was clearly not working for us. By the time we figured out how to cancel with them directly which was just slightly outside of their 14 days window they absolutely refused to issue any refund even though we had shown proof of deletion and no use for it moving forward.In hindsight, I deeply regret not heeding the warnings from numerous negative reviews. My advice is clear: \"STAY AWAY\" from Buddy Boss, unless you want to risk being thoroughly disappointed and frustrated by their products and horrible customer support. Don't get duped like I did; it's best to explore alternatives with better track records and more reliable customer service.Take it or leave it but this experience left us from highly albeit blindly recommending them to others because their site looked beautiful to being complete absolutely appalled by the product and will never use or recommend it again."

Once you need to dive deep into the platform you will recognize that there are not enough documentation and each support request will end up with a paid service while you can do the same thing with a few hacks on free plugins. I'm not sure if they are selling a free plugin developed in years by changing its name or just the theme, since it is not clearly explained. If you are a beginner without any wordpress experience, happy with what you see with this theme! and willing to pay for extras go for it. For me it has been the worst investment in my wordpress journey last ten years."

The response time isnt up to speed sometimes I am waiting 2-3 days for someone replying running a business this type of unreliable support just doesn't cut it. 3. I am not getting time frames on when problems are being handled ! Its minimum standard to give a timeframe and updates when handling client's problems.PS: For example Kinsta support is phenominal \ud83d\ude0e Or salesmate support! Definitely recommend to check how they do it. Resolution time 1 hour, response time a few minutes."

And just to make sure before committing your effort and money, you read BuddyBoss articles and your impression is that the feature you want actually exists. That once you commit, you will get what you expect.For example: If you look at Gamipress and BuddyBoss app integration articles, your IMPRESSION would be: They are working well together and you will get that Gamipress+BuddyBoss App experience.Why? Because it's how the articles are written. They don't put disclaimers that it's NOT ACTUALLY WORKING well on the BuddyBoss App and BuddyBoss will admit that behind closed doors AFTER YOU PAID, instead of admitting that BEFORE YOU PAY.So now you spent money for the BuddyBoss App and Gamipress License without actually getting what you want to achieve.BuddyBoss will entice you and you will fall for it, but their service is actually the opposite of enticing. And this is evident in the BuddyBoss Facebook Group (both official and unofficial), you will see 90% frustrated users. They even kicked out someone that expresses frustration towards their service.Be careful! Hope this helps."

We had asked for a refund earlier as the delays had already gone on too long, they stalled on giving as a refund as per their promise - then refused it saying it was past the refund date. They asked for a chance to fix it so they could say no refund even though we had asked for it within the appropriate time frame. Really dishonest money grabbing company.

Having run my site for seven years now with sales growing year on year, I now face the very real reality that I will have to file for bankruptcy due to the very poor management of this company. Don't be fooled by the glossy presentation and the chirpy videos. The reality is the product is badly coded, regularly breaks when fixing one module it screws up another, they are more interested in their app than their core web product and support is almost non existent with virtually all tickets having to be forwarded to their development team. A team of one.  Even if I do get all the outstanding issues resolved by the end of tomorrow I fear its too little too late and I will not only lose my business but my home too. Do not work with this company you will waste your money."

Their support is subpar --- while they are responsive, they really don't solve anything and blame a lot of the issues on WordPress. All their support is via email; they could learn a lot from WordPress' own support which is amazing. The Chat team deserves a medal. Secondly, BuddyBoss has not analytics for their Community. They outsource to a third party, but a) that product isn't compatible and b) when you open up a ticket with them, they say they will not support any of their plug-ins. Thirdly, BuddyBoss lists several plug-ins they integrate with on their site, but few of them actually work. The only good thing I have seen about BuddyBoss so far are the instructional videos. I am looking for other options to build a Community on WP platform."

The product is not ready for public use.If you have problems and need support, here's the answer: \"please reinstall the plugin\" - or \"sorry, that requires custom development\"... total bs! Their support is a total con and they don't even know their own products! That's because their support is uneducated folk from \"cheaper\" countries. When you talk to the big-dogs who run the company, they are nice and helpful... but their generic support blows.Don't buy the app, and don't expect useful assistance beyond \"reinstall the plugin\". They also delete negative comments and reviews from their social platforms which makes them look perfect. It's obvious why they don't showcase something like Trustpilot because the reviews here are REAL and cannot be filtered in their favour."

I've never worked with such bad plugins. I understand things can happen but the lack of consistent and reliable interest and effort for helping their clients solve these issues is maddening. Right now they claim to have a new 3.0 Theme, yet on their site in my account I only see a 1.0 Child theme and a 2.2.4 Theme for download. These 2 pieces of software are conflicting causing my page to break, issue with php folders and more. Going on 4 days of messages stating \"we have escalated your case to so and so.\" I cannot wait until a developer comes out with a better learning / course delivering product so I can end this relationship. There are too many bugs to list in this review / vent. Beware and do not put your hopes in Buddy Boss. Something will always go wrong and it's so hard to get help. My site's main member area page has been reading \"critical error' for one whole week after updating the plugin in wordpress. I hired 2 different people from Fiverr and neither could locate nor solve the issue."

Of course, how can they sell if they say upfront that the integration is not fully working? That will invite doubt and won't get your money.Be careful about these deceptive practices. PS: 1. They might say there's a trial period, but look at this: The trial period is 14 days, and support takes months. How can you be within the trial period if support takes months? Be careful. They are really good at grabbing your money without accountability. It's you who will lose in the end. 2.

When he was asked for the CSS code to hide a particular button (which the Buddyboss setting is meant to do), he claimed \"there is no CSS code\" that does that.Surprise, surprise Wasiur, any Wordpress developer will tell you that is utter BS and we have actually managed to hide the button with CSS code. So much for \"support\".Avoid this business at all costs unless you can afford your own developer and do not under any circumstance pay extra for any of their services unless you enjoy banging your head against a wall.Theirs is the worst service provided by any Wordpress plugin developer."

It all looks beautiful but is very buggy (both platform and app). Even without any custom coding. Definitely check the reviews here on Trustpilot before you buy...We are a client already for 2 years so we know what we are talking about and it will cost us a lot of money to migrate everything to another service but unfortunately we don't have another choice. We get too many complaints about the platform and the app from our clients. Working with Buddyboss has caused us a tremendous amount of frustration, lost time and income.The end result: a platform and a mobile app full of bugs and a hardly trained, way too small technical support team (with freelancers working somewhere remote in a cheap country) that has hardly any experience, works super slow and super inefficient. They probably get rewarded based on the amount of tickets they reply to instead of the quality or resolution of an issue.It's clear that they prefer fast money over quality and long term success.A pity..."

I say act dumb because they have TECH supports and they expect you to be smarter than the TECHS. For every reply, it will take an average of 5 days to get another response. So they act dumb to delay fixing your issue.4. You will be forced to update your plugins but will have more website issues after updating. Try joining their Facebook Group and all you can see are issues but they will delete negative posts.5. If they cannot solve your issue, they will tell you they are looking into it even if it's been already months WHILE YOU ARE PAYING HUNDREDS of dollars.6. If you have Mobile App issues, they will tell you it's your issue and not BuddyBoss, then later on find out the issue is with BuddyBoss - but their strategy is to make it look like the issue is unique to you only.7. If you post issues in the Facebook Group, they delete the post to hide their scam.8. Remember paying hundreds of dollars? If you tell that to the Facebook Group, their response is \"Other BuddyBoss users are earning using our platform\". That's how they dismiss your issues. Others are earning using their platform so don't complain about paying them for a lousy support and service full of bugs.If you don't believe any of this. Try BuddyBoss and leave a review here later to prove how horrible they are and warn other potential users."

The chat is not active, ever!

We thought it was our own mistake or something as we didnt get it we try to disconnect it from the website and start all over again.Disconnection is not disconnecting it is actually stopping your subscription. But when you buy lifetime you would think you can re-activate it.Wrong they expect you to pay again for a lifetime that was already paid as lifetime.No support available no solution provide. We got one answer that clear did read anything about our problem and asked a random question.We got no where yet. Truly dissapointed for such expensive product. I had first class assistence for 25 USD subscription this company should be ashamed of themselves in stead of hiding behind a huge FAQ. Fact they got a huge FAQ already shows they did not figure out how to make a efficient website as their priority is to collect first and ask questions later."

If the positive circuit works despite my warning, try buying it. Unless it's a waste to lose your huge amount of money.The company's app products are not perfect, and there are too many bugs. There are also bugs that didn't exist at first, but the problem is that they can't solve the problem. CS and the development team will make demands to solve the problem and you will respond accordingly. In the process, time really flies indefinitely. It's a relief if the problem is solved. The problem of keyword search not working properly has not even been solved for nearly a month. In the process, your month just flew away, and if you had opened the system to customers, you would have to close your business.For your information, don't be relieved that there is a 21st refund period. There is a bug after the 21st, so the app does not open. CS is saying nonsense that a six-month service can be temporarily suspended for refund requests. I spent the first 21 days asking for action on service issues. And next month, the app will not open, so it will not be able to use it. Service team? Development team? Basically, each communication is contacted after two to three days, and three to four weeks are quickly spent after waiting for their increasing authority requests. As I said earlier, I can't catch the problem. In the end, it makes me give up and not use the function.For reference, despite not providing normal services, this company, which only mentions the 21st refund standard and does not refund, now has no answer at all even if it inquires.If you want to blow away money and time coolly and experience garbage response services, try Buddy Boss."

          "Contenu": "I just spent the past six months trying to create a new website using BuddyBoss, and have given up. I had high hopes for BuddyBoss, but the product doesn\u2019t live up to the hype. The one claim they make that they live up to is support, which is good.If you want to build a site that\u2019s a straightforward clone of Facebook, with no unique functions or features, BuddyBoss might work well for you. But if your members need functions beyond ordinary social media, you\u2019re probably better off with a plugin like Youzify that allows you to add these social media features to a regular WordPress site that allows you to do anything.Here are just a few of the major problems we encountered:1) They  have a \"BuddyBoss Integrations\" webpage with a long list of plugins that supposedly are compatible with BuddyBoss, but I think they just mean your computer won\u2019t blow up if you combine them.  For instance,  Elementor is on that list, which was a major plus since we use it heavily. But it turns out that none of the core BuddyBoss pages (like Groups, Forums, Members, etc.) are editable in Elementor: you can only create new pages in Elementor using their Sample page.2) Don't believe their claim of requiring fewer plugins: you\u2019ll need tons of them. It\u2019s true that you don\u2019t need BuddyPress, but that\u2019s about it for cutting down on plugins.3) Many of our support requests got the reply that we would need to hire a professional developer to get what we want. Sometimes it seemed like sending business to developers was the reason they created BuddyBoss.4) The turning point came when we realized that we were spending half our development time trying to work around BuddyBoss limitations. We bought it to make our lives easier, not harder.We were far beyond the 14-day money back guarantee. But, since we never used BuddyBoss for even one minute on a live site, I was hoping for at least a partial refund, since it turned out to be useless to us. (There\u2019s no way you can really discover that in just 14 days.) No such luck: $228 and six months of work wasted.I worry about the future of the company.  They regularly have lifetime license offers that they push really hard. They are sacrificing future revenues for a cash infusion now, which makes me wonder whether they have staffed-up too fast and created too much overhead."

If you are a small business owner.2. If you consider time = income.3. If you will be using additional plugins aside from BuddyBoss.Then BuddyBoss is not for you. BuddyBoss is for big businesses that have the funds to pay for the service and at the same time wait 10 days for one (1) support ticket - Imagine if you have more than one (1) support ticket.Here's a sample for one (1) support ticket:*You: I want to ask for support about .....***9 days waiting.*Support: Thank you for your patience. Just to be clear...*You: (responding right away, 2 minutes after receiving their response) Yes, that's what I need... ***4 days of waiting. *Support:  Thank you for your patience. We will submit this to the technical department.***5 days waiting.  While you are stuck waiting for a response, you are paying for the service, and can't fully use your site for the business because you are waiting for a resolution.So if you have an army of developers in your business where you won't be needing support from BuddyBoss to get your business up and running, BuddyBoss is for you.Make no mistake, I am a BuddyBoss user because I've already invested effort and time on my project - I just want to inform you if you are a prospect who values time.I am using other premium services too but I always get a response within 12 hours ALL THE TIME that is why I have a reference to compare from.As for the trial period, if you do not need support - the trial period will work for you.But if you need support, the trial period will be over before you get support.1. If FAST support is VERY IMPORTANT for you and your business2. If you value your time as well as how it can affect your business3. If every dollar you spend on premium service is important to you Then find an alternative. You will not just lose money for paying for the service while waiting for responses, you will lose time = income on your business side as well."

          "Contenu": "This review is based on the leadership team at BuddyBoss and their policies. I will make this as short as possible. I was an early purchaser of the BuddyBoss app and purchased the annual app license for $2,148.00 USD. It took BuddyBoss 3+ months (+/- 90 days) after my purchase date to put together a system that would even allow their app build system to operate correctly. This is obviously past their return policy deadline. I had previously positive experiences with BuddyBoss's desktop platform and the communication from them and decided that we would stay the course and try to wait for them to catch up with their software that was released too early to be a successful launch. Almost a year later, I've tried everything in my power to use their app software. This is including hiring an ex-developer from BuddyBoss who was hugely responsible for a bulk of the commits in their github repository. We have concluded that the app software will not work for my use case and we have not used the software, cannot use the software and will not be able to move forward with it. As a matter of fact, BuddyBoss can look in their system and see that we were never able to even submit an app build from their system so we obviously have not been able to use the software. I have asked that they consider a refund or at the very least, they consider a partial refund as we were never able to even use their product. You would think that morally, they would be competent enough to understand that a cash strapped startup could definitely use the funds that they allocated toward software that they have not and cannot use and provide some sort of refund. I have used ZERO of their resources on this subject so there has been ZERO overhead on their end when it comes to my case specific. They have refused to provide any refund or any real solution except to offer me a service that goes with the software that I cannot use as they know I cannot use it and at this point it's moot. All I can say is that if you aren't absolutely 1000% positive this software will work for you, please be very careful purchasing anything from BuddyBoss. Unfortunately, in this case, their greedy business practices have shown to supercede their morally competent human practices. I have zero reason to believe that if they cannot be understanding in a case like this, I'd be surprised with their decisions in cases that even less favorable. Good luck!"

They didn't show me a confirmation that my \"first\" order was complete but instead made a one time offer that I perceived as the same offer. Beware! The sites in their showcase are all dead. They used to have a page with high traffic sites using their theme but they are also dead or using a different solution.

I highly doubt promoting someone to an organizer you'd want that person to be able to delete an entire group for example. Give admin the options to turn these abilities on and off!!!2. Also there is no front end moderation options as seen on the backend, admin have enough to deal with in maintaining the site. Give organizers or other roles ability to actually moderate the reports. All this is given to Admin role on the backend. I'm sure an admin don't want to promote other users to admin role just to help with moderation reports! Admin won't want to sit there looking at reports 24/7 so let other roles help with reports from the frontend.3. Banning. So many issues.Once a user is banned and kicked as the name puts it the handling of this is very poor. They are redirected to the 404 page not found if the group was invite only. Extremely poor way of handling banning. They should be told they are banned from entering the room not directed to the error 404.Another issue with banning. If someome is banned and an organizer thinks Ill remove the banned user from the group because they dont want them in the group that ban is then reset and does not apply. A banned user can then request to join again OR even worse if the group was not set to request to join they can come straight back in the room and start messaging!! Why on earth is banning being removed after you remove a user from a group! Where are you telling organizers that if they remove someone from a group the ban does not then apply?So to keep someone banned you cannot actually remove them from a group they have to stay in a group to stay banned. Again this just isn't an acceptable way to handle banning. And give those banned an option to request to be unbanned!I'm not quite sure how the developers of this plugin are not aware of all this and perhaps they are not actually thinking or real world use case with a busy site.I can go on and on with other issues. I would urge the developers of this plugin to really think about real world use case and how all this actually functions on a live busy site."

This issue, which was caused by their theme incompatibility with the Divi Builder had been outstanding since December 2022. I use Divi for various reasons. If you\u2019re using a Buddy Boss theme, be aware that there are plug-ins that you may no longer be able to use effectively. I am using it for the community, groups and news feed functionality.

          "Contenu": "The plugin is one of the best on WordPress, although their support team is awful.Reported a bug with all the technical documentation and identified the exact 3 errors they have (I'm a developer).We are 20 days in support messaging back and forth between the technical team and me and they do not read the messages. They have 0 capacity to do any basic testing to the point I had to provide a server for them to test.After providing the server and step-by-step instructions and the 3 bugs BuddyBoss has the support/development team is unable to follow them. They end up changing the configuration of the server by mistake and messing everything up. Which I had to keep maintaining so they can keep working.Days and days lost, videos recorded with step-by-step guides so they are aware of what it is going on on the software they write, but not even with the videos. I request to speak with someone technical so we can increase the technical discussion and that person would see the bug just in front of their eyes, but there is no one technical in the company. They need time as they can\u2019t replicate.In the meantime my client has a broken service, I have one of my servers taken over by buddy boss (support/development/technical team) and spend a substantial amount of unbillable hours every week messaging the support team which can\u2019t follow a step-by-step guide/video.If you are an agency/developer avoid this plugin. If you are non-technical and have no capability to glue alternative plugins together and your only option is BuddyBoss, good luck, my friend.Update: After filling this complaint I got a message that the issue was resolved and got 3 days to answer. I was away and the ticket got closed without being fixed. I have reopened the ticket and buddy boss support claims the issue is fixed, which is not."

To be honest though, it was their disrespect and blatant lack of care that got to me. Things can go wrong, it happens, but you just don't treat customers the way they have been. The support is also terrible, one example telling me we had an issue with a conflicting plugin but it turns out it was nothing to do with any plugin but an incorrect setting. Digging further it turns out they never bothered testing it at all in the first place! In short, BuddyBoss is great product but DO NOT TRUST them!"

This can be seen in their roadmap: features that were on there for Q2 2020 still haven't been completed a year later.Yet the app is still a complete mess. They're charging people hundreds of dollars a month for an app that should have been a beta (to be honest, even alpha). Truly terrible.Support is completely incompetent. Tickets created take a week to get a response to and support staff is obviously not knowledgeable. Had especially bad experiences with Michelle R. Graham and Jason are nice, but I sincerely dislike the recent developments in the FB group. They noticed customers were dissatisfied, and basically took over the group, turned on post-approval and rejected any posts that criticized them (they created a new rule \"Good Vibes Only\").To anyone considering buying this plugin, I advise you to join the BB Facebook group to get an overall feel of real customers think. TLDR: Poor communication, completely incompetent support and bad management (sometimes it seems like Tom is blaming the users in his video?). My advice? Find another solution, but don't go with BuddyBoss."

There is a problem with the video uploading feature on Browsers. Tested on there own Demo site and the same issue is on that. When using different browsers the video uploading is failing. Especially so on iPhone and Chrome browser. Works fine on Android and Firefox but issues is with iPhone and Chrome browser for different MP4 files.Also a CSS issue on Forums for the report moderation button for normal members showing off screen after clicking the button. Again same style problem is on the demo site. Flex and absolute positioning of the popup and button is causing this. Using absolute positioning of the button to fix it.Some other issues with the Gif container on forums looks to be recently fixed so that's good..Would highly recommend they use additonal front end moderation options. Not many people will want to set users as admin role to help with moderation reports. Currently this is done by admin role only. This really needs changing to include front end moderation help and for moderator role to have ability to ban members from Groups. Banning is currently handled by organizers and admin role.But unfortunately organizers have to many options for the settings in the Groups. Admins may not want certain Organizers to have that much control over there groups and ability to delete them and edit them. I'm having to write custom functions to block this ability for organizers. All just seems a bit backwards and really needs changing.Moderators really need the ban member feature added so this doesnt have to be handled by organizers and admin role.Also when a member is banned and removed from the room the banned member can re-enter the room and still post. The banned member needs to stay in the group for the banning to work. This needs fixing."

The BB theme also presents a few compatibility issues but it's the app side of things I am reviewing here. I went (and paid) for the \"Done for you\" service to build an app. Don't believe their hype. Some of it is 'done for you' but you will be spending days trying to navigate their processes (most of which is laid out, but the instructions are confusing at times as they appear to have one set of instructions regardless of whether you are on the DFY service or not) and you are going to be spending a fair bit of time doing things in Apples App store connect and the Android Play store as well as other bits. Little things they gloss over like you having to get a legal agreement drawn up for the app!I have lost count of the number of times I have had to reach out to support for help in navigating the process. They do respond positively but it can take a bit of time. The problem is they say things like \"Your provisioning profile probably expired. If that's the case, you will need to create a new one.\" and then don't tell you what that is or how to fix it so you have to go back again and ask. Really time consuming and frustrating.I have found the done for you 'service' frustrating, complicated and very time consuming process and I'm still in it, months later. To be fair I am busy but 'Done for you' it isn't by any stretch of the imagination. I am still hopeful of getting my app out, but boy it's not easy or quick.Given the amount of support time it takes you would think it would be less hassle (and cheaper) for them to genuinely have a 'done for you' service."

I would happily pay a monthly fee for CHAT SUPPORT! WPMUDEV, DIVI and others have 24/7 chat support. you could have two support plans, \"Buddysupport\" which includes support for WordPress and Buddyboss. \"Buddy+support\" which includes help with the plugin integrations."

However, your extension arrived a couple of days late and by that time we had already moved on to buy a different theme.We appreciate that you earned our goodwill by processing the full refund even though you could not earn our money. However, we left on good terms, and under those circumstances, there is always another time in the future. If we decide to give it another shot in the future, we will come more prepared to tackle the same issue in a different way.Thank you for being there.Amrik"

I installed this as soon as I got it and I am extremely impressed, yet again! The look and feel of the designs and the extra features under the hood really give my site a fresh minimal looking design... I definitely feel Buddyboss understands what their customers want and need with the flexibility/customisations they allow for and managed to create another WordPress leading product/plugin. For every new update and every new feature that Buddyboss releases just adds more and more value to my own brand that I built of the back of the Buddyboss platform so I cant wait to see whats next...!A Big Thank You to visionaries and most of all the teams of people that sit in the background and create this!"

There will always be minor and/or major problems with all software depending on how a person uses it, server configuration etc.The BuddyBoss support has been great so far. They've been very helpful and insightful. I've learned a lot especially from Tom, a member of their customer success team and that eventually increased my conversions and helped me build foundations for the future.BuddyBoss also has an official Facebook Group where all the users and some of the support members & admins connect and share actively. I always find an answer to my questions or problems that would lead me in the right direction.So my experience with them so far has been great.Other great stuff is the BuddyBoss roadmap. They are listening to customers and developing new features or improving existing ones. It's like I'm presenting my customers new features without putting any effort.At first I thought I didn't need the social add-ons but day by day they are becoming more crucial to me and my future plans.Once configured with the necessary server and plugin settings it runs very fast and smooth.I love my BuddyBoss platform, thank you guys!"

I use the Web and App in conjunction and due to the product has made my brand noteworthy within my niche. When things don't go as smoothly with the platform support have always done a good job and I am also quite forgiving for the times it does take them slightly longer but I have never experienced a bad service with them. Also I keep in mind that their technology of allowing me to use my wordpress database with a native app opened up the doors for me to start my brand and platform with full control of my data and website with full transparent prices at a fraction of the price of other solutions, which has helped me budget in my business. As Buddyboss are the only ones in their industry that I could find providing this solution I see them as industry leaders. This is all compared to other solutions for me to have an app that ranged from over a hundred thousand building from scratch and other hosted app solutions that up the prices on you depending on what features you want to use and how many customers you get! So a lot to be said for Buddyboss!!!"
