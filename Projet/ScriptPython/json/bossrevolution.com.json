There is no other way to correct altered number (unless you memorize rewrite).  To restart,  it takes at least  5 minutes. It brings unnecessary ads; rather providing efficient functionalities. I'm not good writer to describe all the inconvenience about boss revolution app."

I did everything they wanted including uploading my ID, social security number, address, etc. The money I sent was blocked.  Because I was unable to send the money, the hospital could not do the procedure needed to treat him. As a result he died.After his death, I tried sending money for his burial and your system refused me. I called your incompetent employees who once again, could not help me. I was soo disapointed  with your services. The last 806 dollars i tried to send was taken from my account but never paid. After some days I had to call and cancel the transaction but my refund ha not yet been done. I have called your office more that 20 times and no one could solve my problem. I asked to talk to a superior and not manager seams to exist. I have been your customer for years, how can I not be able to send 4000 dollars to safe my brothers life. Your services are the worst.

I recommend that BR offer month-to-month plans to customers and send a reminder to pay. I don't like automatic refill because it seems to debit money from bank every day or every other day. I also recommend a quicker notification during calls to inform that only 2 or 3 minutes are left before call disconnects. With that courtesy notification, customers would have time to add balance before calls abruptly cut off. I have had very important calls cut off because I did not realize my balance had declined to zero. Usually only a short, maybe a few seconds notice, is given before call drops. Sometimes no notice at all comes before call drops. Thanks for your attention."
