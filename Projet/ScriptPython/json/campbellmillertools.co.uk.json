I am 88 years old and no longer drive, the only ways by which I could collect are by hourly train + 'bus (3 hrs inc return  journey) or by a one-and-a-half mile walk to the appropriate 'bus route, an infrequent service, then a change of 'bus in town (half a day or more) or taxi.  Current fuel costs mean a taxi fare amounting to \u00a350-80 at least.

As these were not \u2018new\u2019 products in appearance I requested that they be replaced but Campbell Miller do not agree. This is a factual account of my experience and should not be removed from Trustpilot just because it is awkward reading. Bosch themselves do not accept that they send out new boxes with irrelevant labelling and are now following up on the apparent \u2018repurposing\u2019 of boxes by Campbell Miller Tools."

That end did not even have any sellotape on it to help to keep it secure and just relied on the cardboard push in flaps. Hence the hedgetrimmer could just drop out of the box.To me, this level of packaging is totally inadequate and unacceptable. I contacted Campbell Miller who advised that they ship 30 a week in similar packing and have not experienced this problem before.I have tried the hedgetrimmer in the house and it makes all the correct sounds and so I'll keep it but I am not happy with how it was despatched and think Campbell Miller need to review their process."

I asked to speak to a senior staff member, but was told i couldn't. Terrible experience.UPDATE.....In response to CMT's reply to my review, it has not surprised me that they have tried to worm their way out of looking incompetent. The facts are they shipped my order a full day after they had confirmed cancellation of my order, i have emails and DPD shipping logs to prove it. CMT also stated that they apologised at every stage, this is not true either, again, i have every email to prove it, i even had to ask them for an apology. Also in response to me \"demanding\" \u00a325 compensation, i merely suggested that they compensate me as they still had not refunded my money and i had spend soo much time chasing their errors.I am assuming that it is the same member of staff who made the errors who also deals with the reviews online, trying to cover their own back, rather than admitting and apologising like an honest online retailer.No doubt some more untruths will now be posted.................................."

          "Contenu": "I ordered an item online with a promise of delivery within 48 hours. When the item didn't arrive I called Campbell Miller Tools to enquire as to its whereabouts, only to be told that it wasn't in stock and they were waiting on a delivery. I asked why they had accepted an order for an item that was out of stock and I was told it was a mistake. Fair enough, I said and suggested that it would have been good customer service to have called me rather than leaving it for me to call them.I was told that the item should be arriving in their warehouse sometime in the next 2 or maybe 3 days and that they would call me as soon as it had arrived. Again I didn't get a call so I had to chase CMT. I was told that the item had arrived and would be posted out for next day delivery. Great!Next day and again no delivery. I called CMT again. This time, the warehouse were at fault as they had forgotten to post the item. Another promise of next day delivery before 12pm which CMT very generously were not going to charge me for, and Saturday deliveries cost them extra don't you know.Saturday noon came and went and no delivery. I called DPD, CMT's delivery company of choice, to ask what had happened, only to be told that CMT had not processed the order in time for it to make the next day delivery service and that it would be delivered the following day.I finally have the item, a week later than anticipated, and I'm very happy with it, but I am very disappointed with the level of competence and customer service that Campbell Miller Tools offered. As an e-commerce business maintaining stock levels and an efficient delivery service should be paramount. Then when the odd mistake happens these should be quickly and efficiently rectified. My order and delivery were a catalogue of errors followed up with a request to share my experience of TrustPilot. So here we are.Personally, if I were to buy this item online again I'd use someone else (i can't mention who), who offer an efficient and reliable ordering and delivery service."

I requested a resend no less than 5 times, but still haven't received it!

I rang customer services and they advised that the postage charge for off-shore addresses would have been applied before I completed the ordering process. I pointed out that I had not noticed this at the time and had decided to purchase from them as other sites offering free postage to Northern Ireland were slightly more expensive. Campbell Miller declined to reimburse the postage costs but amended the website advert re to mainland UK within minutes of my call."

However, new stock arrived in time and the order was dispatched the day before the item was to be delivered, but not sure whether it was dispatched too late but delivery didn't then happen on the day they said it would; it arrived the following day. I did get quick replies to my emails and they did agree to a Saturday delivery without the extra charge if the new stock didn't arrive in time. Was the late delivery a courier problem? Who knows. I'd order from CMT again, but as with any online retailer, \"in stock\" when you order doesn't mean an item will still be available when you want it delivered."

I called CMT to be told that all they could do was send an email to DPD advising them of the address change, but could not guarantee they would read it!!!Next day I called DPD to be advised the delivery was still scheduled for my office address and they had no record of an email, but if received, they would hold the delivery at their depot for 24 hours and then deliver it to my home address a day later, when you guessed it, I wouldn't be there.I then pleaded with the DPD agent to PLEASE ensure that it continued to my office address where I had to arrange for someone to receive it.It arrived in good condition, but what an absolute nightmare of a process when it should be very simple task to change the delivery to my home address, that was in fact associated to the credit card I used."

There was no compensation for this massive waste of time or no apology from DPD or from the online retailer. I paid for an angle grinder, with expected delivery in few days. For 2 weeks, their chosen delivery -DPD claimed various reasons for missing deliveries. I have sent several emails advising their managers that I have workers and family living on site and there are 2  front CCTV cameras, 24/7. There was no DPD driver visiting or leaving a missed  delivery card, as they claimed on their website tracking links. On the third week, a DPD driver finally visited our house, again on the CCTV footage, it showed him refusing to give the parcel to my elderly mum in law, as she wanted to check the label before signing for it. In order to help address their poor customer service, I have suggested to CMT and DPD ijn all my emails to inspect my CCTV records. Before the refund, I asked to get this item collected from a safe shop on their list. Surprisingly, they refused to deliver to that shop, claiming it was closed because a car had crashed into their front window. I visited this shop and that accident did occur few weeks ago, but the store was open for business and had received few DPD items for collection in last few days. . I hope this information would be helpful for many customers and they will think twice before agreeing to use DPD as a delivery service."

Delivery has all been via a next day courier (either Parcel Force or DPD) and the items have showed up when expected (including the delivery slot allocated).The first item I ordered was showing as in stock on the website but was actually out of stock however I was kept informed about the progress of the order and instead of receiving it Wednesday I got it the Monday (3 working days later).  Once they realised a delay was likely, they immediately contacted me and gave me the option to proceed with the order or cancel it and get a full refund.  I chose to proceed and have subsequently ordered a few items from them.I'm more than happy to recommend them and use them again myself. The four stars is only because of the out of stock item showing as in stock.  I would have gone 4.5 or 4.9 if I could."

I would have given 5 stars, however, following an attempt to purchase an item which became unavailable due to high demand (I bought it through their online service but then received a courteous email to say the item had been refunded due to not having enough stock) and then increasing in price when back in stock, I feel only four stars can be rewarded.  When the item became available again the price increased from \u00a399 to \u00a3150, and the customer service representative did not offer a reasonable explanation. Frankly, I feel somewhat disgruntled by the huge increase in price. It will not stop me from buying from Campbell Miller again, I just feel that, on this occasion, they have taken liberty with the fact that the item I wanted is in high demand and have, therefore, increased the price. Not the most professional of business etiquette and i will be more cautious in the future. Just to reiterate, this is the first time this has happened and I have generally been satisfied with everything."

I would have awarded 5 out of 5 but I felt I shouldn't have needed to get back on to DPD once I notified Campbell Miller of the problem but they didn't want to play ping pong between me and DPD once they had achieved getting the driver turned around. Items are delivered half a mile from my door because I live remote up a track. As DPD didn't give me a time slot I asked that the driver call me when the package was left in the open at the bottom of my track. I asked so the expensive item wouldn't be left unattended too long and because it was raining. Needless to say DPD didn't bother ringing so it's just as well I went to check before it got too wet."
