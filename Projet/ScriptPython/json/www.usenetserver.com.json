It's been over a week now that I have been back-and-forth with customer support and I still keep getting locked out. I keep trying to recover my username, but the name they send me doesn't work. Beyond frustration.  Security make sures you can't use your account. The whole issue might be resolved quickly if I could actually talk to a human, but alas that's not possible ... they don't provide telephone support!"

Still they billed without notice.I only saw that because I went to Paypal to remove the subscription. Tried to ask for a refund was just told I am screwed because I used it too much (there was apparently a limit I crossed but that was never indicated I never did I get a message telling me I have to pay to go over it...).Don't make the same mistake and avoid them at all cost.Oh and to make matters worse : their completion rate is so bad that my download was useless, impossible to repair. Total waste of time and money."

I was pleased with the availability of newsgroups, and the ease of setting up Mozilla Thunderbird as a newsreader with their server.Unfortunately, I am still unable to post to any newsgroups, even though I've got a paid account now. On my control panel page it simply says \"Posting disabled\" with no explanation.This would not be so bad if they would respond to support ticket requests in a timely fashion and just explain the issue to me. But I have submitted several tickets over a period of a week or two, and have not received even one response. When I submit a ticket there is not even an acknowledgement that a ticket has been successfully submitted. I have tried this with several different web browsers, including Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, but the same result each time.If nobody responds to my support requests toward the end of my first full paid month, I will simply cancel before my plan renews. It would be nice though, if that happened, that I could receive a full refund. That is unlikely however, as they won't even respond to me to address my concerns.Update: I finally did a Google search to find the way to create a support ticket, and used email to contact support. They responded almost immediately, although at first they were reluctant to enable posting on my account for fear I was a potential spammer. After a few emails back and forth, I thoroughly explained my purpose in using their service to post to Usenet newsgroups, and they enabled posting on my account.All in all, finally a pleasant experience, but it would still be nice for them to fix their support ticket web form on their site and get it to work. I have altered my original 1-star rating to an unqualified 5-stars."
