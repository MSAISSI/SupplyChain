During the online session I attended on 2/26 Paul said that we have access to the educational resources under the education tab - as a high school agriculture teacher and flower farmer THIS was perhaps the thing I was looking most forward to accessing.  I\u2019m disappointed and frustrated, feel misled and quite honestly this is one of the reasons I don\u2019t typically sign up for programs like Seed Time.  I hope that we can come to a resolution or I may be inquiring in how to cancel my subscription.Thank you,Michaela"

Winter gardening is a huge challenge for cold climates and with the exception of Eliot Coleman minimal detail was offered up.  I feel like way to much time was spent on the individual guests backgrounds during intro.  The guests were on for so short a time span it was almost worthless.  You mentioned early on that ginger would be discussed later in the week.  That never happened.  People turn in to these things to get real solid information.  I took time last year to watch a gardening series titled Grow Your Own Vegetables that offered up real useable gardening advice & techniques. I tuned into Seedtime series hoping to up my game and was quite honestly completely disappointed.  However, the gardening advise portion aside, the calendar+ Seedtime has produced is far superior to anything I have come across.  Useable for both home gardener & larger farming operations.  Kudos to the thought & execution you have put into that product."

What was annoying was all the upselling that goes on before you even get your account set up.  The intro is that it's free and always will be.  No credit card needed.  But once you start to set up the account the upselling begins.  Buy this to get that feature.  Pay for lifetime access to this feature for only X dollars.  At one level I understand this.  But at another it just feels like a small con.  Not as bad as Elon Musk happily taking $15k from you on the promise of full self driving mode, but a little like that.  Too bad one can't get started on the program before one is bombarded with all the things you could buy to make your experience even better.  Keep in mind that I essentially haven't had any experience yet.  Can't I have at least one day, maybe even one week, before you try to convert a free Beta test into a revenue source?  I mean really, just give me a day."

          "Titre": "More Good Than Bad, Could Use Some Improvements",
          "Contenu": "So far Seedtime has been more helpful than disappointing. I generally struggle each year when it comes to planning out my garden and when to do what so this has been perfect for that!My major complaint is that there are very few crops to choose from and making your own (which is almost necessary) is locked behind a pay wall.It's a little pricey to upgrade, but I understand that hst right now they need support. I would much rather donate (and honestly probably would have ended up donating more than what I'll pay to use if for a couple of months) than have a yearly subscription, which just doesn't seem like a sound choice for something you don't use for about half the year.My other frustration is that when making custom crops you are required to put in *all* of the information (such as days until maturity or when to transplant) immediately, which often takes a little research. It would be better if I could enter in more info later and just have the factors that require those bits of info limited until then.One of the reasons this is most frustrating is because this is *why* I would want to use Seedtime. I don't know when do to certain things and often information is more related to what the average temperature is than how many days until something is ready to transplant. If they could somehow add average temperatures to that algorithm, that would be wonderful and honestly bump the whole program up a tier above all the other spreadsheets and books I use to sort out my planting schedule.An additional feature that it could potentially benefit from is the ability to map out and visually plan your garden. That alone might be enough to encourage me to start using it earlier in the year than I did. I do see a lot of potential in this program but right now I don't see myself using it enough to warrant continual subscription. I may stay on just to support them, but right now it just lacks the ease-of-use that would make it better than other similar methods of tracking crops."

You enter what you know: variety, your planting zone, when you want the harvest, etc., and the browser-based application fills in the rest, including seeding and transplanting dates and succession plantings to maintain an extended harvest. The new layout function currently lacks for tools, but It's getting better. The company has grand plans for added functionality, but Seedtime already saves me a lot of time in planning the garden year over other applications I have used."

I will be able to create layouts for other planting areas around the house that are not vegetables. I used to struggle keeping track of varieties, when to start indoors, direct sow items, crop rotation and replanting for longer harvests. With Seedtime and a layout I will be more prepared for each year. Now to find the time to start setting everything up for next spring and grow from there."

Especially for someone who is tech savvy challenged! I used it over summer and it saved me sooo much time and the videos taught me alot! Unfortunately I could only have a free account at that time. But that was ok because I was shocked at what you are getting at the free level!! I'm finally able to get a unlimited lifetime membership! I really wanted the garden plan! Also it's evolving and getting tweaked that in a couple of years it's going to have everything that you ever wanted or needed in an app!! It's only offered so many times a year so don't hesitate! Seedtime is worth every penny for what it is now and what it will be! Plus the additional workshops Paul and his dad do now and will do in the future are invaluable! Get an unlimited lifetime membership! You won't be disappointed!!"

          "Contenu": "Seedtime has taken the hard work out of planning my garden. I just plug in the plants i want to grow and seedtime does the rest. It lets me know exactly when I need to be starting my seeds for transplanting or when to direct sow those seeds that will go right into the soil. It also lets me know when to transplant and it even tells me when those crops should be ready to harvest based on my growing zone. For someone like me who loves to garden but has lots of responsibilities that are not garden related this is a game changer. There is no more guesswork as to when to do a task, seedtime has it all laid out for me. Thank you Paul and Edwin for making it possible to grow the best garden ever without all the stress of wondering what i should have done differently."
