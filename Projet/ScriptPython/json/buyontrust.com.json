          "Contenu": "This company may be fine if you intend on keeping the product. In my case I returned the item in less than 48hours after pur having and talking to BuyOnTrust Customer service regarding returns.  I asked if there are any additional fee associated with the returns I was told no and more attention was put on giving a review. After returning my item BuyonTrust is attempting to force my lease to stay open to the tune of 1700 because of a return fee. I said no problem the amount of the return fee has been taken out of my account so you guys can use that and disregard a refund. The company wanted an additional 200 via PayPal and said the money paid can't be used....So at this point they are trying to have me pay for nothing at all. Im highly disappointed in the way they do business....and intend of fighting this every step of the way."

          "Contenu": "Trash, third party middleman company.  Nothing but a website which is edited as they need.  Takes no responsibility to help you if your product is defective.  5 trips back to best buy and still not resolved.  Also after 5 times of returning to Best Buy to exchange phone at your direction you are 100% right, I won\u2019t listen to any more bs.  Looking forward to that return shipping label and no, you won\u2019t be keeping any of my money.  Dispute is being processed  with bank and Best Buy management has preserved the video of when i picked up the product.  Making false accusations against a customer is really wrong. Even if you edit your post after the fact. You can point out where they handed me the alleged cash.  Way to expose yourselves.  Nevertheless if you weren\u2019t a trash third party company you would understand the phone case was wrong and because of your poor customer service Best Buy made the discussion to exchange the case for the correct one.  How they processed that was up to them, not me.   You have edited response at least 3 times after you attempted to report my review as fake and failed.  Just waiting for Acima or our company to supply a return shipping label or some court documents.  Oh, and your customer service, both phone and chat, is what got us here.  You should have a record of all my calls, chats etc, I know I do.  Seems like no one in your company really knows whats going on.  lol. Last but not least y'all lucky I can't share screen shots here."

I was told to reapply to get my fee waived (I did and was approved) and no reply from customers service yet. They say that the return fee was explained , yes it was, after the fee was incurred , and it wasnt mentioned by customer service before returning and they don't acknowledge I spoke with customer service before returning anything to confirm whats needed. So far I have been charged 210$ total on an item I don't possess or own.....I will continue to update this review..... all this headache for an item I had in my possession for less than 48hoursWill definitely update my review if the situation is resolved...EDIT: How am I being difficult when I followed you guys instructions to remove the rental fee?....seeing as though I've been charged more than the rental fee up to this point and the slow speed of replies I've been more than agreeable. As a person who works constantly i can't wait around for calls. So perhaps if you can give a time frame or something more reasonable than the attitude and hassle I've been getting that would be far more helpful. I would assume a customer being continually charged for an item they don't have would be a priority...."

          "Contenu": "They are extremely inefficient and don't value their customers at all. I felt like they are doing some kind of favor by selling products more than 30%-40% more than their original price. Honestly, I don't have any problem with the price but believe me their customer service is so trash you will just lose interest. After 2/3 days of their nonsense, I ended up canceling my order. There are lots of other companies who will treat you better. Highly suggest you avoid this bogus company.Reply of the reply-LoL! Seriously?? I already discussed my travel plan with their agents the very first day! Verified my identity and whatever they asked me for ( That was very very time consuming process by the way). Then after all that they changed the store and the date for their own convenience (Customers has no priority). On the due date I returned from the store for their inefficient process. And on the next day the nonsense agent cancelled the whole order and told me to go back to my place cancelling my whole travel plan?!! Wish I could post the chat history here that I send to trust pilot for the verification of this review.To BuyonTrust-If you think you are doing some kind of favor you are absolutely wrong! And also if you think you are doing enough, trust me others doing way better than you (Already got my things). I'm sure you will get more bad reviews in the future if you keep doing this nonsense with your valued customers.Peace!!Oh! You guys are really something!! Wonder if you are even legit or a fraud company?! Second response:If I am not real I wouldn't have replied you or reviewed your company on the first place! If someone has complain against you it's not like you have to degrade them. You know this a vital difference between you and other companies. You guys are just showing you real face to other people. That's good actually!By the way you verified me two times. Still you could have asked me for more information, which is absolutely not a problem for me. Me and my brother stay at the same house, so it's kind of hilarious how you flag things! Grow up and try to act professional.Now don't waste my time here. Already wasted a loOot!Last message to the general people-Who ever planning to buy things from this company- Do your research first and don't waste time with their craps because they are literally the worst one there. Lateron, you can not even give them a negative review! LoL! And, I don't know who the F is there in their fraud detection team but he/she is dumb as F! Bet he didn't even passed his Bachelor! Low lifes!"

Extremely knowledgeable patient friendly and because of Katie I was able to get approved and get get everything I needed before my deadline. Thank you so much bye on trust and I hope all of your team members are just like Katie and I'm not even exaggerating on the level of professional courtesy and never once made me feel like I was bothering her with the million questions I asked. Me and my wife thank you Katie and of course we think bye on trust for approving me for my loan"

As a Manger of a shop. This means more to me then you know. At first I struggled with prices. Then realized we have early pay options. This guy just wanted to make sure I was happy and ready for the possible deals to come. Great company to deal with. Regardless of the prices from short to long term payments. Amazing people to deal with. Thank you."
