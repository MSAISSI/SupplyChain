The pickups are done around your schedule and the drivers are precise, clean and courteous.  We are also part of the program to re-purpose some of the equipment we send and I am confident in the ROI being one of the best in the field.The website is another thing that is absolutely wonderful and user friendly and just another way that this company builds confidence with their customers.Whether it is to schedule a job or ask a question, I can pickup a phone or send an email and I know that I will be taken care of immediately. I have and will continue to recommend Retire-IT."
