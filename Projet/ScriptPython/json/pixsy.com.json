Report attempted fraud and extortion to your local police station. When enough (international) police reports are made, it will be an Interpol case and they will be arrested finally."

I would not have bothered wasting my time putting together all the information and proof regarding the image theft. When you submit a case, there is even an option you can check to tell them the image is available on stock sites - Why isn't the case automatically declined right then? Why isn't this basically the first question?The next criteria was that the image needs to be registered with the US Copyright Office. I come from Europe. The site that stole my image was located in Europe. So, pixsy is only for US citizens? Why isn't this communicated from the start so peopel outside the US don't waste their time? Last but not least the list of criteria said that they basically only go after big companies, as small fish are not worth their time.All of this should be clearly communicated on their site from the start. Would save both them and photographers a lot of time."

They are sending long intimidating letters in legalese in hopes of bullying website owners into paying extortionate amounts for images that are mostly licensed under Creative Commons licenses. Small business owners and private individuals get rightly stressed and scared of threats of litigation and pay up hundreds and thousands of pounds, even though in most cases the alleged infringement did not even occur. Pixsy know it, but will try it on anyway in hopes that the ignorant victim will not be well-versed in the intricacies of copyright law. Like any cyberscammer, they send multitudes of such auto-generated emails a day, in hopes that a small portion of recipients will get bullied into paying without defending themselves in court. This kind of frivolous litigation may thrive in US, but courts in UK will not look too favourably on such a waste of their time and resources. To anyone who has received their ludicrous long-winded extortion email that amounts to nothing - have no fear. This is still UK and your rights are still protected by the law. Make sure you don't fall victim to their scare tactics and seek legal council before, if at all, engaging with these scam-artists."

          "Contenu": "On 7th July I received an email from Ricard J, Case Manager Pixsy Case Management Team. The email was very aggressive and in essence instructed me to click a link to pay \u00a3570 licence fee for \u201cunauthorised usage of imagery on my website\u201d. There was no grace period to remove the alleged image, they wanted payment and fast!At this point I was confused and very concerned. I investigated and there was an image from a competitor selling a similar retro \u201c50s style\u201d dining table which was I was selling. I emailed back to say that the style was not copyrighted, in fact the design was around long before the competitor was even established. There were lots of companies selling this same design. I was using my own imagery which I had created so I have not infringed any form of copyright.I said that if the claim was not dropped, I would have to instruct a solicitor. The response was cold and aggressive \u201cYou might find our email insulting, but it is an alternative to litigation. You simply cannot use copyrighted images without permission or a license. I welcome and encourage you to instruct solicitors, at your own expense, as they will advise you to resolve the matter amicably by paying a retroactive license\u201d.At this point I just felt as though a larger company was bullying me and forcing me to just pay the \u00a3570 fee so they can get paid.I stood my ground and emailed back to basically reject the accusation and that I would leave reviews to highlight my experience and warn others. At this point the email suddenly changed, and the response was: \u201cIt appears there was an error, and this was a mismatch. You are right, the images are different. Given the above, and without prejudice should any other images have been used, I am discontinuing the case.\u201dPixsy are at best grossly incompetent. But I couldn\u2019t help thinking this this is just their scare tactic to increase their revenue. If they email enough threatening letters, they are going to get people who are just bullied into paying their fees to avoid further actions. Once Pixsy admitted their mistake there was not even an apology. It was a simple \u201cThis matter is now closed.\u201d In my opinion Pixy are a cold, aggressive, rude and horrid company who make their money from threatening letters trying to force people into paying fees. I would put them right into the category of loan shark debt collectors who are really at the bottom of the barrel. If anyone wants to deal with a reputable company who has any class, I would highly recommend avoiding Pixsy and finding a more competent service provider, not some low class bullies who would possibly sell their grandmothers to make a few quid profit. An absolute disgraceful company, probably the worst I have had the displeasure of dealing with."

          "Contenu": "On the 2nd August, 2021, I received an allegation from Pixsy that I had used an image, without authorisation, on my business website. They claimed that the image was the intelletual property of a named copywright agent and that I was required to pay a licensing fee for its use.Having created my business website using a highly reputable self-build platform, I had utilised their free images library. I immediately spoke with my website host, as well as forwarding them the allegations from Pixsy. They are able to confirm that the image was theirs and that Pixsy should forward any allegations to their team who specialise in copywright infringement. I informed Pixsy of this, in writing, as well as confirming the email address to whom they should forward the case.Despite this, I received a 'Second Notice' on 13.08.2021. This notice made no reference to my previous correspondence and threatened to escalate my case to their partner attorney to initiate legal proceedings. I immediately called their London office via the number on the email.I spoke with one of the 'Case Management' team who admitted that the second email had been sent in error and that they would pursue the claim via Wix. This telephone operator did not disclose her name and was reluctant to engage in conversation as soon as she identified that I was the 'defendent' in this scenario.Having investigated this online, there is a lot of evidence that this business genuinely support artists whose legitimate copywright has been infringed. However, there is also ample evidence that they actively seek to extort money from new and small businesses who may not have the forsesight or resources to identify a potential scam. I am a small business owner, fortunately with a specialism in the legal sector. As such, I will not be paying their demands for a licensing fee. Instead, I shall await any notice from my website host that the image should be removed from circulation."

While a few cases have been completed, there are many cases still open after a whole year, and it seems there's nothing they can or will do to get those cases resolved.  Worse is the cancellation fees if you choose to cancel a case that was submitted in error or if you were able to work things out with the infringing party directly.  Pixsy should allow for a handful of \"free\" cancellations per user depending on the tier they pay monthly for.Also, I feel we users of the service should have complete access to all documents, call logs, and emails that are sent to the infringing parties.  Complete transparency is the hallmark of an honest service.  I say this because it has come to my attention that the first few email attempts to a recent infringer did not even name ME or MY Business in the demand letter.   I don't like that."

I took screenshots of this, I took the names and addresses of the offending items and publishers.Then repeatedly we were told \"we could not find details of the person who uploaded this\".  So on eBay, a seller has to publish the item, they are responsible for it and if they are a business who steal your images they are 100 per cent responsible.On all sellers if you click 'contact' it provides, their name, registered address, email and phone number.Its super easy to find.However, Pixsy could not find it apparently, even when it was provided.Then when we Vero did take downs, the response was \"we can no longer find the images\"  erm yeah because it took weeks to do nothing, so we removed them ourselves"

It scans the net to search if any of your pictures has been used and you can check if it was fair or unfair use and take action to have your rights correctly acknowledged. It's as simple as that. The only downside is that not always matches are 100% accurate but they are accurate enough and probably the rate will improve with time."

My cases concern for example companies that stole my pictures probably in poor quality from social media and started printing them on pillows and other amenities. There have been a few cases that ran into nowhere and were closed just like that - fine for me.I can understand the companies here, that try to find a proper solution together, feel bullied. This may not always be the perfect way of dealing with copyright infringement, but: Every company should be aware of this topic no matter how small or big it is. Many photographers like me do not earn a bunchload of money for their work but have to pay for expensive equipment, travel costs and more. Therefore I think the work of pixsy, in it's general sense, is important."

Their email responses were prompt when I had questions, too.I took one star off because of the following:- they make you spend a fair bit of time adding case details BEFORE they tell you oh, sorry they can't help you with Creative Commons licensed images in certain countries like Germany or Spain. Which was annoying as I'd spent time filling out the rest of the details before getting to this stage. I wish they would ask upfront so you don't waste time (also, why isn't it covered in those countries - it would be nice to get an explanation).- They pay your money within 30 days of them receiving it - it is a bit long I think, it would be better if they paid sooner. - Their cut is 50% - it would be nice if it was just a bit less... but still better than nothing so that's not a big problem, if they could sort out the first major pain point I mentioned above."

It accurately identifies images that are either actually yours or very similar.  For those images that are actually yours, the website page using it is identified and you can either go and contact the site yourself, or use a Pixsy \"Take Down\" process.  I have not used the latter, but on half a dozen occasions, it found unauthorised use of my images and I was able to get credit, which is all I ask for these days.One downside is that I found there were a depressingly large number of sites using my images but since these were Russian and Chinese, I simply couldn't face the prospect of trying to get them to acknowledge this.  This is depressing, but since I don't expect to make huge amounts from my images it's no worse than that."

Many people use the images as well, as they assume Google is a free resource for the website posts and builds. Pixsy helps track all this down. It's not perfect, but it does help the process a great deal.Also, at present it is primarily set up for photographers. As an illustrator I can only use the search and find option, as the takedown option and register artwork at the Library of Congress is limited to photographers. But I would recommend the platform (if you want a shock at the level of copyright theft), and I am glad there are teams out there trying to help us creatives."

I weeded through them and the Pixsy user interface is much easier to use than the last company I was with. I whittled it down to around 1600 and many of them were no go's but we are working on a few high profile companies right now that have infringed.I'm very happy to have Pixsy doing the majority of this work for me.Its cases I would have never found, or had the time to persue."
