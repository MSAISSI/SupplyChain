They told me on 9/20/2023 that it would finally be looked at within 24hr's-2 weeks from that date and I heard and received nothing. The many staff members that I interacted with knew nothing and were extremely unhelpful. I asked for some sort of refund since the website said that texts were sent when I can 100% confirm that they were not sent and they said they would not refund me. Horrible, frustrating experience!"

They\u2019re difficult to get ahold of, support tickets are just ignored, and once you do get ahold of someone, they just send copied and pasted responses that are no help. It\u2019s really unfortunate that you pay what you do and trust them with your business, to have such awful customer service. I personally cancelled my subscription because of it. I recently had a situation where my text to my list (for my biggest launch of the year) said it was sent and delivered, and nobody received it. Textedly support was no help. It was really an unfortunate situation and for all the reasons listed above, I no longer trust them with my business. I still haven\u2019t been contacted back."

          "Contenu": "Since becoming a Textedly customer, I've lost thousands in revenue due to the ongoing delay in approving my A2P 10DLC Sole Proprietor Campaign Registration. As a result of the approval holdup, it's been over 6 weeks since I've been able to send marketing alerts, sales events, coupons, discounts, announcements, and notifications to my customers. Not only have I been paying for a service I can't use but this delay is costing me potential sales and hindering my business growth as each day goes by.For fellow business owners considering Textedly, be cautious. My experience serves as a warning that the powerful features and efficiency promised on their site may not be the reality. Before investing time and money, beware of the potential roadblocks and delays that Textedly may cause. From my experience, Textedly is a poorly managed company that is incapable of delivering on its commitments. I strongly advise other business owners to avoid Textedly until they resolve their approval process issues."

THEN to add insult to injury, when you have questions, do NOT expect them to be answered by the \"available representative\" online. they may answer one or two and then you get the generic statement that \"response will be available within a few hours\"....so if time is a luxury that you have, then this website is great-as long as you have some computer savvy to you. otherwise you will be watching a lot of youtube videos to figure out.one other caveat, if you plan to send MMS (picture or such) via text, they charge u three messages. if you plan to do simple text campaign the you get 160 characters for it to count as one text charge. plan accordingly for how much you plan to spend and use.  i do not recommend this website"

You have no way to address a contact in your text by name, 4) you have no ability to create a texting journey, 5) they automatically put opt out language in outgoing text in a way that is weird, 6) they have a weird way of calculation usage as they use 3 messages if your text includes your logo. 7) since no support, no way to cancel, no way to reach customer service, I had to charge back to my Amex."

The quickest way to do this is to cancel your current account and open a new one with a free trial. We will be able to grandfather in your current pricing for this new account.\" Upon cancelling our account and establishing a new one, we were told that our existing rate of $10 a month would not be honored, because the plan no longer existed. When shown the message above, Textedly support replied that the representative who told us our rate would be grandfathered was \"misinformed\". Although the most basic plan is now $25 a month, we were offered what was referred to as a discounted \"blue ribbon plan\" for $20 a month.After several requests to escalate the issue to someone authorized to honor the promise made, we closed our account."

Textedly Chats are the only way to communicate about your account. Upon chatting with Emily she assures me the 10 digit code will work for my small business. I sent several Texedly massages and each time i would receive confirmation that each message was indeed sent. But yet no one would receive them. So yet another application for yet another method is suggested. After waiting WEEKS waiting for the service to work the messages are still not received from my customers, although Texedly assures me they are being sent. Textedly says they may be being intercepted as spam as they have no control over that. This service is a complete joke. Do NOT waste your time.

This one-star review is a vital warning for those considering utilizing their services.To begin with, attempting to connect with Texetdly's customer service proved to be an arduous endeavor. It appeared as though they had adopted a policy of actively avoiding customer inquiries, as they provided no discernible form of assistance. My emails and phone calls went unanswered, leaving me in a state of exasperation and a litany of unanswered questions. It was apparent that they viewed customer concerns as a mere inconvenience, rather than an essential part of their responsibility.Even if, by some miracle, I had managed to establish contact with their customer service, it is highly doubtful that it would have made a significant difference, given the pervasive disinterest and lack of willingness to assist that I encountered during my solitary interaction with them. The extent of their indifference was astounding, leaving me with the distinct impression that my concerns held no value in their eyes.Beyond the lackluster customer service, Texetdly's troubles extended to the functionality of their service itself. Messaging issues were frequent, with messages often arriving late or failing to be delivered entirely \u2013 a fundamental failure for any SMS service. It became evident that Texetdly fell short in delivering the reliability and functionality that customers have the right to expect.However, the most distressing aspect of my Texetdly ordeal was their billing practices. I had entered my card information with the understanding that I would be billed on a monthly basis, only to discover that they had charged me for an entire year. This practice is not only deceptive but also ethically questionable. Worse yet, disputing these charges turned out to be a cumbersome and aggravating process. To add insult to injury, the dispute negatively impacted my credit score, all thanks to Texetdly's mishandling of billing. This situation is utterly inexcusable, highlighting a severe lack of professionalism and integrity within this company.In conclusion, I cannot overstate my profound dissatisfaction with Texetdly. This company not only falls short in providing reliable and responsive customer service but also engages in deceptive billing practices that can wreak havoc on customers' financial well-being. My advice is straightforward: steer clear of Texetdly at all costs. Spare yourself the frustration and potential financial fallout associated with their subpar service. Awarding one star is far too generous for a company that exhibits such a degree of ineptitude and indifference toward its customers."

          "Contenu": "I requested a service cancellation prior to the start of the month and was still charged for this service. I requested multiple times to speak to someone over the phone and also illuminated several site glitches that causes me to purchase more \"keywords\" than I needed. All of those requests have been skillfully ignored. A few annoyances that had me unhappy with the platform prior to this unjust charge to my account:-The platform is not user friendly-Beware of unknowingly purchasing unnecessary keywords as they don't auto-populate in the system (that's how I racked up a total cost $40 more than the estimated monthly subscription)-Customer service is prompt but vague and will ignore your questions. I made a request via their website and the ticket was closed with no reply-Links within their customer service messaging system are broken, making communication on the same issue difficult-Though I have canceled my account, there is an upcoming charge still listed on my account for the end of the month...-You have to make a special request to upload your contacts into the system-To send a link to a website or video, you have to have your \"toll free number\" approved, which can take several weeksAside from the billing frustration, the service did not work for the task at hand, and we wound up working with EZ Texting. I highly recommend their service, it was seamless. No special requests for contact uploads. No unfair billing. No site glitches."

          "Contenu": "I have used textedly for nearly 4 years without issues. I have numerous accounts on this platform across various businesses I have in the sports and entertainment space. For the first time, I had an issue with their system going down (Friday night). I sent a message, and it didn't go through... I tried it again about 5 minutes later, and a 3rd time in another 5 - 10 minutes. Nothing went through to the phones. The textedly dashboard showed that I sent 3 sets of messages totaling over 1,000 messages (a high number due to # of users/subscribers to the keyword). This was at a critical time of the event where communication was key. My team had to scramble to utilize another way to communicate with our audience so we could continue the event.The next morning I attempted a new message but the system still wasn't working (7 am) but came back online around (9 am-ish). I then had to purchase more messages (about $100- $150 additional) because my monthly package allotment was used up due to their previous system malfunction. To make matters worse, one part of their website states they have customer service on the weekend, and the other part says they don't. Its ironic a text messaging service used for communication doesn't have clear communication. So now everybody gets back to work on Monday, and I get a message that they WILL NOT reimburse me for my additional spending or credit my account for the messages that didn't go through. To make matters worse, this is a message I have received from \"Emily\":\"Due to the nature of your business, we are unable to offer access to the Textedly platform. We are unable to provide any refunds here.\"I run a 100% legal business in the sports and entertainment segment. As i stated above, I've used this system the same exact way over 3 - 4 years. I have 4 businesses using this system in the same exact way... These accounts never had a problem, but as soon as textedly has an issue, their way to deal with it is to tell me I'm not being refunded, or credited, and that my account is going to be disabled.A true mark of a company is how they are when things are going wrong, not when they are going right"

The FAQs are not well-considered: perhaps Textedly should hire someone to come up with answers to questions an actual user might have, as answers to the most basic questions continue not to be answered on the website.  Either you have people on hand to answer questions, or have good FAQs.  Not having either is not good.  That said, once you get ahold of a person, they seem to be nice enough.  I'll continue to recommend Textedly to senders with a relatively low volume of short messages, but will search for a more-affordable solution for higher-volume senders."

Competitive pricing. Cons: Once uploaded, you cannot delete any contacts. You can only manually unsubscribe one by one. They say that they skip landline numbers, but it's not true. They charge credits and attempts to send messages to all numbers (mobile & landline) and shows \"delivered\" despite landlines not being able to receive messages. (I used mine as a tester, and it came back as 100% messages delivered, even though my landline cannot receive text messages) Basically they'll charge you regardless of whether or not your message gets delivered.Overall, I think it's okay, but am not too impressed. Good thing I selected M2M instead of the annual plan so I can decide whether or not to keep this service next month."

They were eager to make things right, which they did, with a 100% refund of the fees I paid. If that would have come sooner and not predicated on changing my review, they would have earned 5 Stars. Things can, and will, go \"South\" when they do handling them unconditionally is a best business practice that earns authentic admiration and rave reviews. PREVIOUS REVIEW The customer service is non-existent. I've left emails and voice messages for our rep, left requests for help through their online chat. Nothing. They say the average response time is \"A few hours\" what a joke. I called the sales line and got a Iive person. They transferred me to the support desk after assuring me they would pick up. It went to voicemail. That was 10 days ago. We haven't been able to send a text for 2 weeks. They also hit you up with \"one-time\" fees that should be part of the regular monthly cost e.g. personalizing your message with a \"name\" field from your subscriber list. Personalizing your message should be a standard feature after all you're sending your message to subscribers. This is a company that sets a new low bar for standards."

We were chatting with someone online and were simply told we would have to get a 10 digit code for 30 days before they could submit a request to get it changed. We explained we were already a customer with them and had another account. The person online said simply sorry they couldn\u2019t do anything. We said we wanted to cancel our account then and got no response. We then called in and were told we couldn\u2019t speak to anyone because they have a \u201climited phone staff\u201d but someone would call us back. A man named Ivan called us back and we were told that the laws changed two months ago but since we had an account established long before this change he would send our info to his procurement team and there shouldn\u2019t be an issue getting us a short code once they check our account. He was informative and very helpful. This is why I\u2019m giving 3 stars vs 1. We have yet to get this short code. We did however get a response later in the day from the person we were speaking to online about cancelling our account with no guarantee of our money back. I would hope by Monday we will get a short code otherwise we will be calling again."

I am open to hearing what they will do and will continue to update on progress from the company. They offered my free services to make up for their customer service and training for their staff. They had days off for the holiday and I mentioned that they needed to have an away message or something on their chat so customers knew that at first. I appreciate the reach out and will continue my service and will update you at the end of the year. **Original post** At first, their service was great and for a great price ($10/mo.). I had no issues until I needed to increase my messages. I called in to get no response for two days. In a panic because I hadn't heard back from a phone message OR their chat, I ordered more messages through the web-app before Black Friday to go out on Thanksgiving night. I got a confirmation that my text was supposed to go at 8pm on Thanksgiving day. It did not go out until early the next morning and confused my thousands of customers. In an effort to contact them to downgrade back to my original $10/month service, no one seems to answer the phone and you only can reach them in chat. They are NO HELP, NON APOLOGETIC, and RUDE! Give your money to a company that actually LIKES their customers. I own a boutique and know better than to TREAT ANYONE like this. They claim they can't get me back to my $10 a month and there lowest plan is $29 or something. SCAM SCAM! Yes, I am a real paying customer. But not for long. I can't wait to switch providers and have the world hear what I have to say for these cowardly scam artists! They'll treat you like dirt, then charge you."

There is a somewhat extensive process to get verified and up and running before you can start sending out texts, I would say it took a week or a little longer to be able to start mass texting. The texts are sent out in an appropriate amount of time and is easy for the user to stop receiving them based on their preference. I would say the biggest drawback is when someone needs to be removed from your group, it's not easy to re-add them as the number becomes blacklisted for re-joining which requires that user to resend a message to reactivate. A little cumbersome. Overall, a good product."

As a non-profit pricing is critical for us, especially as we use many messages in the summer and very few in the winter, so their flexibility offered is helpful.We are able to differentiate different groups for outgoing messages too, minimizing customer frustration.  The only wish I have is a capability to mark multiple customers with the same tag at once, right now it is one at a time and can be time consuming when you get many responses at once.  Our customer base is happy, so we are too.  I think when a few upgrades are made for ease of use this will become a 5 star rating.    Customer service was super helpful when I was researching the different companies and options so I feel good about this choice."

To notify all the previous clients, we chose to text the phone numbers. It was easy to import all the phone numbers into Textedly and I was thrilled that Textedly automatically removed landlines and repeat numbers (removed ~400 numbers in our case). Very easy to create and send a message! It does create a toll-free number for you, and replies go to your Textedly account instead of your personal/business number. I wish it had gone straight to my business phone in my case, but I simply put our business number in the message I sent out. Highly recommend, Textedly saved me hours and hours of time!"
