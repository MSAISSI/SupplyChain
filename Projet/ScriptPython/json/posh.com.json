For a one person office that's quite ridiculous and completely unaffordable. We were also told that we would have an account manager who would be our direct contact. Very much not the case. In fact, we never heard from that person again and dealt with multiple people. A service of this type should have account managers to moniter usage and provide guidance initially."

Fact:  Out of 83 calls to support, not once was I able to reach someone directly. I was always forwarded to to someone to take a message and have someone call me back.2) Out of several dozen test calls during the trial, not once were they able to follow the instructions on the script.  Instructions which were suggested by, and written by, Posh support after my feedback.If you are considering this service, do yourself a favor, try calling their support before you become a customer.  See how many times you end up just leaving a message.If you still go through with it, place many calls during their trial period.  See how many times things go as planned.Edit:  Our sales floor manager, also a 50% partner, signed up with his name/e-mail.  We do not wish to share additional information with POSH about our experience."

          "Contenu": "I\u2019m not the type to leave online reviews, but I felt I had to report my experience with Posh.  I give 3 stars because everything was going great with my onboarding process until we had to make an update to my call script.  I was first told the updates would take 30 minutes, then was told 24 hours, then was told to be patient, and then my multiple follow-up e-mails went unanswered.  Very unusual for this business to become unresponsive and disappear without an explanation.  I\u2019ve since decided to start working with a different virtual receptionist service that can send messages via fax (Posh sends messages only via SMS, e-mail, and their app), which works out better anyway for my business.UPDATE:  Downgrading my review to 2 stars because Posh failed to address the issue (their unresponsiveness) in their response.  Why were they unable to deliver on their promise?"

The only reason there is one star missing in my review, is because their agents are still working out the hiccups when consistently following my instructions/requests. There are a few agents who sometimes don't follow my call instructions. HOWEVER, Posh has the best customer service, hands down. Any time there is an issue, they truly seem encouraged to resolve it and get better. They are also quick to reimburse when mistakes are made. That is hard to find with a reception company. I think that if the same agents are left on my account, and they learn how I want my calls handled, this will be the best reception company out there. It all starts with customer service, so Posh is well on its way. (And to be fair, my call instructions are very specific and probably more complicated than most clients')"

They were never leaving voicemails, so this has been amazing.  I've recently (the last month or so) had some trouble being able to call to turn the service on and off. Once they get this remedied fully, I would give them a 6/5 star review!! They are amazing!"

Fast forward 6 months and I have no cause to complain at all. Scripts are followed professionally and the receptionists are professional enough to handle any ad hoc situations. I have used several call centre/ virtual receptionists over the last 15 years and POSH stand out for us as the best by far. The app is also convenient and easy to use.Price wise, I think it is fair. Again I wasnt really sure about the price brackets and structures but our monthly spend compares favourably with other 'similar' services and is within the range we are happy with. Keep up the great work POSH team, here is another satisfied customer."

My experience has been phenomenal! They answer my calls 24/7 and accommodate my Spanish speaking clients. They send me emails or texts via their portal or my preferred method. I can task them outbound calls to schedule appointments, make appointment reminder calls, and/or for something completely out of the ordinary like scheduling a reservation or other appointment for me. They'll even communicate with me after a request is completed or to provide the status on it. I can accept calls when I am able to and when I am unable to the Posh receptionist will appropriately schedule a client or route it based on my personalized protocols. I researched tons of places- virtual and local- and Posh offered the best service for the best affordability. Posh has made Key Rose, LLC more efficient and smoothly run!"

In two days total, I was not only enrolled with them but they were also servicing my clients well. Their app is great and my sales rep Pamela rocks!! She was so understanding when I told her I needed this service to start quickly because my former service changed its system. All team members of Posh have been very helpful to me as well!! I have called and used their app to make changes to my account and everything was a breeze. So nice!! I do wish they had one more option for monthly minutes on the phone in their packaging because it jumps in price from one of their packages to the next pretty steep, especially for a small business. My eyes bugged out a little when I saw the price jump, but that would be my only thing. Overall, their service is really what shines and I appreciate that very much. Thanks!"

          "Contenu": "I couldn't be happier with my experience with this company. They are all so elegant, communicative, professional and eager to please. One of the hardest things about owning a business is staffing. Making sure your staff is an extension of you, your vision and represents the high standard of customer service is beyond challenging, so when you find that it's fantastic and deserves praise. I've had other \"answering services\" and this is much more than that. These ladies are very responsive and communicative and very good at what they do. They are organized and most important, they care about your business and they want to get it right. My account rep really helped me through this process with tweaking things in a very customized way as to fit my needs as a small business and a business with wonderful, but incredibly demanding clients. I highly recommend them if you need a higher level of customer service to help when your front desk isn't available or to use after hours etc. They are also fantastic as a virtual receptionist and so good that your clients/patients aren't even aware that they aren't sitting at your clinic or office in person... and that's a huge compliment to them. I not only get alerts with detailed information, I can actually call someone back from my personal cell phone and the customer doesn't see my personal number, they see the name of my business. They've thought of everything....its pretty amazing. Great service, great business model. Highly recommend."

Posh was able to design an inbound call rule set that perfectly matched what we needed, and immediately began proving their value by never dropping the ball.  6 months into it, not a single ball dropped, not a single complaint, and nobody not even our highest-end billionaire clients have so much as mentioned us having an answering service helping us.  I couldn't possibly be more enthusiastic about Posh and you are making the best decision for your goals by working with them."
