          "Contenu": "I am using their most expensive plan. I originally loved Podia because the features fulfilled my needs exactly. But as revealed by the other users here, they have difficulty acknowledging their system problems. They have production issues and bugs due to which I lost customers. But their customer service will give you canned replies. I should have read the trust pilot reviews before buying their service.They charge so much from their customer. But when I reported a stripe integration problem in India they made it a 'me' problem instead of testing it out at their end. Even some VP of their Product spoke with me rudely as if they were doing me some favor that I was facing this problem. But it was a low priority because no one else seemed to face the same problem as me. I have been in product management for 8 years and never have I ever seen a VP product giving excuses instead of asking their developer or QA to test the bug at their end to replicate the problem. There is so much resistance to even replicating a bug! Jeez!I have lost customers because sometimes their 'buy now' pages won't load in Canada. Upon reporting, they again gave some generic canned replies and didn't solve my problem. And I have paying $89 a month for their product + $9 for their email plan. And this is the kind of response I get from them.Please use some other platforms folks. It is totally not worth the price they charge from their customers. They are absolutely unaccountable for their production problems.EDIT: As seen in the reply below, the blame was passed on to Stripe. However there are platforms like memberspace, sendowl, sellfy that also integrates stripe (India) and I haven't faced any problem using my stripe account with them. Please don't fall their BS"

Didn't receive any email confirmation (which stops this from happening on any platform). Now... I'm utterly stuck.Emails to hello answered to begin with then nothing. I complained and got an email (with no apology) saying they had \"reset my account\".Guess what? They hadn't reset the email address so clearly had not even bothered to read the email chain.VERY frustrating. Very incompetent service. Terrible bug on the site. Also clicking \"chat\" just opens a search box. That's not chatting."

It has been 3 days and NOT one word from Podia. On it's website it says customer service 7 days a week. I haven't gotten not one single email. I host my membership on Podia so not only am I locked out my members are locked out as well. After this experience I'm moving my membership to a Wordpress site. I'm done with Podia."

We've been their guinea pigs. And the customer service? Unresponsive to all of our problems and requests.

No it doesn't work that way never has never will.

Chat is not working any time you try the conversation they tell you from 9 to 5 even if you are sending it at 1 pm.  Oh the best is if you try to email them they quick you out. It just doesn't go through. It's a nightmare.  I can't list everything but i feel like these guys are the most important.  Their website builder is a nightmareAnd if you think you will really get you 14 days free you re dreaming. They charg you right away no free days to try.  And good luck to get in touch with someoneStay away from it. I never write bad reviews even if i lost money. But this is not something that people should go through especially if you are starting your business and try to make some money"

I literally search every page that Google gave me, nothing! To try to get my site known to the world wide web, I started working on a Google ad. In that process, you can let the ad-building program look at your website to get the best keywords to use. When I did that, only keywords came up that had voice coaching and singing lessons in them, while I have a drumming business!! CS did not help at all and only avoided all the issues I stated and gave evidence for. I started looking for a better alternative that day."

          "Titre": "Awful customer service and reliability",
          "Contenu": "Great at first, but severely let down by terrible customer service.Let me explain, as if you have looked at the other reviews and see 5 stars, then 1, you may be confused. This is because when people first start, Podia is all good. It is after all quite simple (if not a bit restrictive, but there are workarounds) and it seems generous with features. Hence the 5 stars when you first sign up.But if you\u2019re like myself and others who run anything more than a side project as a hobby, where the service needs to be reliable, robust and supportive, then the cracks appear quite fast.As many others have said, their support is very bad. The customer service do not listen and will never admit they have done something wrong, like give you the wrong information about a service. I signed up for their email plan on top of my hosting, so $1000 a year now, and yet I still cannot remove the Podia branding from all my emails, even though I was told this would be the case.To hide their branding on your content when a customer is paying so much is just greedy and unprofessional. They are only concerned with getting you on board and your money, and do not give you the money back if their service fails!This year they had an outage of nearly 24 hours. That\u2019s every site hosted with them, down, no sign ups, no access for customers. That was my full business down! They never gave a reason why this happened, just said it won\u2019t happen again. And yesterday they]ir databases went down for a while, with no warning. The communication is awful and it affects your business.I and several other business owners are planning to move away from the platform. The more you talk about it to them on private channels, the more you realise Podia has a severe problem in their company ethos, and do not care for existing customers, just wanting new ones to sign up instead.I highly advise you to look at other services and see if you can simplify what you offer, especially if running a business from your provider. I am really sad Podia has become so greedy, but when you can\u2019t get in touch with anyone for many hours, or a straight answer for support, it is not a viable option for my livelihood.Just FYI: I would suggest a combination of Vimeo Pro, Mailchimp and Stripe/PayPal or similar, if you are looking fo run a course with video content. Many services now allow password protected, paywall web pages and services like Mailchimp are so much better at handling your data, plus their customer service actually provides service!"

          "Contenu": "Initially I loved Podia. Clean interface, the ability to drip content over time, upsells, embedded checkout buttons you can put on your native site (I use squarespace and this was essential for me). BUT I have had issue after issue after issue, and I'm starting to feel like the issues will never stop.1) Despite the advertising that you can checkout on your native site, when I tested this function during my launch (right as they changed their checkout design), every other time I would check out I would be sent to podia to checkout (instead of it being a native popup on my site). This was one of the main reasons I signed up for podia, so to have it glitch out so much, was a serious let down. It seems to be more consistent now, but now I check it all the time because I'm constantly afraid it might not work.2) The other issue that started when they redesigned their checkout was that upsells were no longer available in native checkout (which I was never notified of, I just had to discover this for myself), and redirected to the podia website even when the checkout for the course alone did work. Now, I have no upsells at all to avoid this clunky redirect. It's again such a let down. It was working fine until they updated their checkout. SO if you're looking to include upsells (which were another reason why I choose Podia), in your native checkout, look elsewhere. 3) Additionally, when I first launched my course I set up an automatic redirect after someone would checkout so that they could go to my custom thank you page... this utterly failed and Podia couldn't figure out why. They said it was because I was using deadline funnel (a SUPER common tool for course creators). But that sounds like a them issue, as about every serious course creator I know uses deadline funnel. It seems to be working now. But it still pains me to think that my customers were sent to my literal homepage after purchase, making my course look super scammy, almost as if they didn't even check out.4) Now, I found out today that one of my customers is on the wrong schedule for their drip content despite them signing up when everyone else did. Their content is being released 1 week before everyone else's, which is a huge issue as I'm creating the content week to week, so she's just seeing placeholders that should be hidden to her.SIGH. With all the money I've spent (now being on Podia a couple years), I honestly have regret. Spending originally $79 and now $89 a month to get these 4 functionalities... to only have them glitch out on me, makes me wish I had gotten started with a more established platform. But now since my students are already signed up and are in the middle of the course, I feel like I can't leave.P.S. The only reason why I gave 2 stars instead of 1 is that their customer service is consistently kind... even if their tech seems to be very inconsistent and their customer service people can't help that."

I love how Podia makes it possible BOTH for beginners and for those who are growing more rapidly in business. It's great that they have the Mover, Shaker, Earthquaker payment options. But the best thing I love (which makes Podia really stand out) is that they have prompt Help from real LIVE people! This is so awesome when you can't figure out how to do something or have a more specific question to be answered quickly.  Other platform options don't have the service I need, so that's one of the main reasons I love Podia."

That being said, comparatively, Podia has more of what I need than the other two.  Podia's features and price allow me to grow my business the way I'm comfortable doing.

Podia support exceeds all other platform and service plans out there. I have used most of the top names and never been satisfied with support! Podia has the most extensive how-to and help files I could imagine! I moved all of my SOLO business to Podia, including email marketing. I have been a most satisfied customer for over 3 years! If there is a feature that anyone suggests and it is good and workable (tech side of things) for everyone, Podia explores it and if found to be good for all, they make it! Podia is great for everyone, even a non-techy person like me! That's why it is the only platform I support for my SOLO CREATOR students."
