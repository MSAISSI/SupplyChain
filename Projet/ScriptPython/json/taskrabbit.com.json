If this is correct, this is modeling poor customer service.  My 1st tasker cancelled at the last minute and there was no one to contact for reparations.  Why is it that a tasker can cancel at the last minute, but a customer cannot and will be charged?  How about answering that question?"

He told me I owed him an extra $50 to use his truck, and charged me additional money every flight of stairs he had to carry an item, and it wasn't even like he was doing it alone... I was helping carry the item, which also wasn't heavy. He didn't show these additional fees anywhere in the listing, so I was completely blindsided. Just felt very taken advantage of after the task was completed."

You're saying that the worker charges $44.37 a hour, when he said his rate is $40 a hour. I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND YOUR FEE OF $15 FOR SAFETY, BUT RAISING THE WORKER'S FEE $4.37, WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE COULD COSTS HIM JOBS. SINCE PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT RATES FOR THEIR EXPERIENCE."

The estimated time for install was 15 hours however the installer only scheduled us for just under 5 hours. He left the empty boxes for everything all over our bedroom floor, trash on our bathroom floor, the closets weren't put together all the way (just some of the frames) and he didn't even put them in the correct places, even though I gave him the renderings and specific codes for each closet component. My husband came home and was really unhappy and said he just created a bigger mess to clean up than anything. I hired a task rabbit handyman to help take something off my husband's plate because of how busy he's been lately, but instead I just created a bigger issue. Really frustrating, disappointing experience."

At 7:05 PM he still wasn\u2019t to my house (two hours after the scheduled time) I messaged him and he told me that he got pulled over for having expired tabs and no break lights. I let him know at that time we wanted to cancel his services. Just this week we got a bill for ONE hour of work, which was about $45.

After about 15 minutes, it's clear he has no idea what he's doing, but rather than just admit he's in over his head, he stays for another 90 minutes screwing around (with me attempting to help him every step of the way), didn't manage to install the dishwasher at all, and still charged me $236. The faulty water cap he gave me to plug the end of the dishwasher line failed overnight and flooded both my kitchen and basement, warping the wood and laminate floors respectively.I called TaskRabbit support to complain. They said the first step for them is to contact the Tasker to get their side of the story. That was exactly the last thing I wanted, since that guy knows where I live, and I wanted him nowhere near me again. By some miracle, TaskRabbit decided to refund about half the total cost, but holy cow, that whole visit probably added $500 to the entire installation process.If I'd picked somebody who wasn't rated at all, then maybe I'd understand that I got a dud, but this guy was _very_ highly rated.

What I struggled with is that he was not equally horrified that he chipped the counter but said it would be covered up. I felt like I just wanted the whole experience to be over.

While he was working in my home he acted very unprofessional, cursing loudly while building the frame. I posted my experience when I reviewed him and he messaged me directly to rebuttal. He insisted that his inability to complete the work was a miscommunication on both our ends. He said I didn\u2019t tell him the exact type of bed I had and for him it was a complicated build. He also said voicing \u201cvocal frustrations\u201d is common in handyman work. I replied and said I selected the correct type of furniture I needed assembled, a storage bed to be exact. He knew he was assembling a storage bed, if there are certain types of storage beds he struggles to assemble, then he should have reached out and asked for more detail when he accepted the job. Not show up and then communicate that it\u2019s a hard build for him. I also said his language went beyond \u201cvocal frustrations\u201d, it was vulgar, loud, and continuous. Overall he completely half of the assembly, but I realized that Taskrabbit does not screen these people and you should be wary of who you invite in your home. I won\u2019t be using Taskrabbit again due to this experience."

The Tasker messaged me and told me he charged me the 2 hour min, I asked why as it was not noted anywhere in his profile and he told me \"idk sorry for the confusion.\" I reached out to Taskrabbit support, the first person I talked to said she would look into my dispute and send me an email with an update. I never received one. I reached out to the support team again today for help. Angelo is who helped me. He offered to refund the hour I was charged, less the Taskrabbit fee they now charge on all tasks per hour. Even though I only had an hour service. I asked if there was anymore he could do since the charge error was in the tasker's error, not mine. I also asked when I should expect the refund on my account. He ended the chat without a response. Extremely rude, esp for a paying customer who is NOT at fault. Makes me want to reconsider using this app."

As a customer, the very first step is for me to put myself at the mercy of before interacting with him: I have to choose somebody based only on his reviews; I have to pick a specific day, time, and my personal estimate of how long the job will take; I have to describe what I need. Then it is up to the tasker to decide whether to take the job or not. He can take the job without ever responding to a single question I may have asked. Once the job is less than 24 hours away, I have to pay for it even if I cancel - and even if that is before I've been able to determine if the Tasker really is a good fit for the job. Twice, I have had the tasker send me one message asking for \"more detail,\" and then I didn't hear from him again until the cancellation window was about to close. The first time I cancelled. The second time I decided to take my chances, and ultimately the Tasker did a good job. However I was stressed the whole time because I had not had an adequate conversation with him until a few hours before the appointment, and I had already put my tenants through the inconvenience of scheduling their lives around the appointment."

Blinds look great, TV mount was installed in a creative way, and one of the shelves fell down after they left. I noticed multiple holes in my wall that they did not tell me about. Now I\u2019m worried about how the TV was mounted. I relied on reviews to pick my tasker, but if I ever choose to do this again I will ask for more examples of work and maybe even a second opinion. I hired through here because I am not an expert nor do I have the time and tools to hang stuff. Was hoping for a better experience."

Taskers book various jobs at a time and don\u2019t show up and I see that there are no consequences.  Just an unhappy customer left hanging with unassembled furniture. I am sure that if I cancelled last minute or after appointment I would be charged for taskers time. I was then able to get someone to help the next day \u201cRafig\u201d, and this tasker was very helpful and communicated well over the app. Task Rabbit takes my credit card and I don\u2019t get any notification if I was charged for the cancelled appointments.

I, and apparently many others, only became aware of this when hit with the giant bill after the task.  For me, it added $226 (37 percent) to the tasker's hourly rate.  For what?? I understand the taskers don't see any of this.  I called TaskRabbit, and all I got was a useless $80 credit for a future task I will never book unless this fee gets at least partially refunded.

At this point, I was well over budget for the project given the original estimate.

Additionally, I was charged for materials that I wasn't expecting to be charged to as I offered to provide everything he needed and $19/hour in taskrabbit fees which I wrongly thought was a $19 charged by the job not per hour. Taskrabbit could be more clear on their service fees including what they're for. I was left with a bad taste in my mouth after my first taskrabbit experience and will not be using the service again."

For 6 hours of work that was about $100 extra that I was not aware of until you download the app and scroll through. Id rather given that to the tasker to be honest.

When I called to let him know that the tasker that he was suppose to work with had cancelled and that none of the other taskers that task rabbit said were available at the time previously arranged for my job were available, he told me he could handle the job and would bring an assistant.  He arrived on time and did an excellent job.My problem is with the app itself.  I was notified the day of the job a couple of hours before he was to arrive that my tasker had cancelled, but the app says no problem this other tasker is available to do your job.  Just confirm.  When I confirm, I am then told sorry he isn't available.  Try one of these other taskers.  When I try those, I can't even check availability for the day of my job.  Since the task involved two taskers, changing to a different day would be complicated.  I was just lucky that the second tasker was so helpful and also able to handle the job.I also had a lot of trouble hiring 2 taskers, even though I was told I needed two.  Once I hired the first, the system wouldn't allow me to search for a second person available on the same day and time.  It took two conversations with live chat customer assistance to get the second person confirmed.  I had a lot of trouble just getting the first person to understand my problem.  As much as I liked the tasker I did work with I will probably not use task rabbit again because of the complexity and the unreliability of scheduling a tasker."

Not even an apology email. When I contacted them, they told me I wouldn\u2019t get charged for the person that didn\u2019t show up. Of course I wouldn\u2019t. That would be crazy. They shouldn\u2019t have done something (discount, credits). This was my first time using TaskRabbit.The \u201cTrust & Support Fee\u201d is also excessive. Almost 40% on top of what you pay the Taskers. I understand they have to make money but almost 40% feels excessive."

And I communicated the IKEA furniture they would be assembling. They arrived on time. They were friendly, and worked independently asking questions only when necessary such as specific placement in the room, and about some pieces we received that we damaged in some way. The specific concern was the estimated time (4 hours) and related cost ($450 or so) was severely underestimated. The tasker spent 8 hours on the job, and we were charged over $1000. That was a huge surprise to us. It is for that reason only that we will never hire Taskrabbit again."

In my mind you just placed an impediment to my hiring you.  There are taskers on the site who say virtually nothing about what they can do.  If you're new you can still point to what you're good at and talk about things like commitment and focus; that's something every customer wants to hear.  If you haven't already, you could mention these points as the difference between being hired or not.  I have an upbeat attitude, things of a positive nature, all important if you're new."

It all worked out in the end and he was unfailingly careful, polite and patient.  The job took about 1.5 hours more than I thought it would, so it was more expensive than I budgeted. I probably miscalculated the time involved and I'm glad he was careful and completed the picture hanging with care and preciseness, rather than rushing through.  I would gladly call on John again."

I did end up finding somebody who actually came out on the holiday. I was very surprised by that. He did a wonderful job that didn\u2019t take him all day. Prices were pretty much what\u2019s to be expected, but I was not prepared for the service fee. Especially the amount that was charged. The original amount I was OK with.
