I only used distilled water in my humidifiers, with no essential oils. I would let the humidifiers run for 2-4 hours at a time. After ONE use, the left valve on the first humidifier stopped releasing steam. By the second use, both valves stopped, and now it\u2019s completely useless.The second humidifier lasted for about 2 weeks. And again- first one valve stopped working, then both valves.So now I have 2 night lights lol. I\u2019m about to contact the company for a refund, and hopefully they have good customer support!"

They charged me full price on a small and large unit and the very next day they both went on buy one get one - they refuse to even put any credit on my account towards replacement filters or honor anything I was told.  HORRIBLE follow up.  HORRIBLE communication.  Too bad - GREAT products but this company will not survive it they continue to treat all of their customers only as the source of their cash flow,.The response from their customer service team (below) is not only untruthful but ridiculous. There were calls made AND emails sent\u2026 I was asked to send an email specifically with the pictures because the product was faulty\u2026and broke when moved.   Aside from that I should\u2019ve received, at very least, an email response back from Bryson your manager\u2026 Or the manager before him \u2026who was equally as unhelpful and did not follow through. At very least some sort of goodwill gesture should have been extended for replacement filters given all the circumstances around this file\u2026 Of which only very few have been detailed in the above review - I stuck to the main points.  In addition, it is untruthful that I was told the product wouldn\u2019t be under warranty\u2026 If that was the case why was I asked specifically to send pictures? Very irresponsible, no regard for customers, zero follow-through, terrible customer service and appreciation for your customers\u2026 As seen by other reviews with similar experiences  to mine"

I found this to be fairly irritating to my system. I turned it off and left it for a while thinking maybe it was just the fan burning a little bit of off gassing, but even later when i turned it on within second the same smell was produced and again i found it irritating to my lungs. Even though they are a hard sell on having no Ozone it is not zero. So perhaps in this case there is something happening here that is causing this reaction, this smell. I can't say exactly what. Either it is off-gassing, producing ozone, electrical burning smell from the fan or something else i'm not aware of. All this to say i was quite disappointed and am now very skeptical to the Polar-ionization technology being as clean as they mention"

The unit is narrow and tall, the base itself to give it stability is about twice the footprint, held to the main tower with very small screws into feeble plastic.  Under the slightest of torque the plastic will break (as mine has) and they will not cover it under warranty (trust me I have tried). Please note I have a strong mold allergy and have tried many air purifiers.  For example this has better air quality than the Allen pure units but my Allen pure units are like a sherman tank, they have a strong firm base and do not break at the slightest twist on the base.  I would expect for around $600 for the unit to have a MUCH sturdier build.I say do NOT buy this unit, wait for version 2.0 where they hopefully have built the same purifying tech into a much sturdier container."

It does not provide real-time status of the unit so when you're travelling you cannot tell what mode it is operating in or that it is operating at all. The child lock is also useless. You can activate the child lock at bedtime, but sometime during the night, the lock will always turn itself off. The control panel will then illuminate your bedroom and change fan speeds depending on what it appears to sense in the air even though the app says air quality is at its best. So the relatively quiet, low speed fan becomes a louder medium to high speed fan. This madenling misfunction does not make for a good night's sleep. There needs to be a bedtime mode or manual mode where the fan speed will never go above low. Lastly, the scheduler function is inadequate. You can set multiple periods for the unit to operate, but typically the unit may turn on at the scheduled time (most of the time), but it hardly ever shuts off when scheduled. Even when it does shut off, it often will turn itself back on at a time for which it is not scheduled to operate. This and the other deficiencies already mentioned essentially eliminates all user flexibility for controlling the operation of the unit. So the bottom line is that the unit probably does a decent job at cleaning indoor air, but do not expect any ability to manually control the unit in any substantial way. I understand changes are in development, but frankly this system is not ready for distribution and should not have been sold in its current limited capacity."

I think if the customer asks whoever the delivery company is the people I brought the product from should make concessions.Again, I love the seven large air cleaners and trust Air Oasis completely. I think a new deliver option should be arranged next time."

When it comes to replacement parts needed at $120 ea. ever 2 years , I feel they are closer to the bent nickel value . I\u2019ve been trying to repair these again , (been about 2 years since last time) for friends. Kinda stinks to go through all the haste only to find out that it\u2019s nothing more than a terrible boat anchor . The costumer service is pretty good , fast actually , and pleasant as well . The product durability/lifespan is weak .  Not a fan for the long haul of these ."

I think one reason is they do not use even the most basic pre-filter and the intake is directly to the HEPA. This makes it fill up with just household dust rapidly. A pre-filter would save a lot of money like it does on every other machine I have and seen no matter how inexpensive the machine. It seems the only reason is to sell more filters? Also if you are chemically sensitive (one reason for a filter) the materials used to manufacture the filters outgas and have VOC's so they require 5-14 days of detoxing before I can even be in the same room as the filter. Why not use safe non-voc etc for a filter that is to clean the air?"

If they were 20 bucks each still giving you nice profit, i would have spent 140 with you.  Instead i spent 60 for 2 of them on sale.   Lets say your cost is $7. Your profit at a reasonable 20 would have been $91.  As it turns out, your profit from my purchases was only $46.   you're better off pricing them reasonably in having your customers by them more often.   Why doesn't anybody do the math anymore!"

Also, the way to turn off the wireless could be a lot more straightforward."

So I printed it out and the diagrams were very small and in gray!  Why put info that is not clear so customers have to struggle to have the info they need.  The marketing dept needs to be updated. The customer service person who talked to me was very accommodating and answered all my questions, so she stopped me from returning the unit.As far as the machine-- it seems to work, but the noise level is too high which almost makes me want to return it, especially at night when I am sleeping so I have to turn it off to go to sleep.  It would have been nice if it was quiet enough so I could keep it on all night if needed. I got this on sale so the price was good, but I am not completely happy with it, but will keep it because of the UV feature which I wanted and it's not common to have it in a purifier."

I have two and one is set up to blow air at me while at my desk. The downside of this is that the air comes out the side and that\u2019s where the plug is. It\u2019s a bit of a weird design and not that attractive. The other one is in my bedroom. That one unfortunately always has a lot of bright lights so I had to stick something on top of the machine since I don\u2019t like bright lights in my bedroom at night. I also placed it in the same spot as my old air purifier I replaced and I\u2019ve noticed that this one is less effective at removing smells from the litter box. I think it may be from where the air is coming in and it\u2019s placement, but it is a bit disappointing that I have it running and it often still smells. The old one was taller and seemed more effective. I hope these are working as well as they say they do but based on how it\u2019s handling smells I imagine it\u2019s not clearing out all the viruses in the air (Covid just went through the house despite having this running constantly and others in other rooms) and mold that effectively either then. Unfortunately I have limited outlets and a small space so I can\u2019t move it to see if another spot would work better at this time."

So, it hasn't been an issue and we have not reached out to the company to resolve it yet. So, I cannot speak about or review the customer service of the company. We were recommended this specific product by a physician and have been happy with it! We are hoping it is \"cleaning our air\" well!"

I had to return one of their purifiers a few years ago and it was an ordeal with a lot of unusual specifics as to how to do it in order to get a refund. It also had a high cost to ship it back.

The one in our room in a house isn\u2019t a problem but our power source in our rv for our pre-firefighting efforts as shepherds turns off every time. I also really dislike the light display that puts a really ugly unnatural light into the room, especially at night. I haven\u2019t found out how to dim or turn it off yet, maybe I\u2019ll put a red film over it, would recommend less white and blue lights that cramp my circadian rhythms, but currently I put a book on it. I do like the feeling of having the quality air, and I\u2019m grateful for the thoughtful combo of air treatments and how quiet it runs without any noticeable electrical hum. I would have appreciated an additional discount having bought 4 units: 2 small, 1 medium, one large and filters for most of them, and happy that the shipping was covered and there was a discount good % off for Father\u2019s Day and for wildfire smoke effected folks, and I bet the folks that need it the most are still priced out\u2026but that\u2019s a whole different rabbit hole."

          "Titre": "Seem to be working but slow....",
          "Contenu": "I recently bought two of the Ionic air models to assist in VOC and mold neutralization left over from remediation activities. I set them up around 8pm, one in my office for the evening and one in the living area. House is a single floor with basement furnace return air, fan set to on for constant circulation in the house.These units are very small with low flow rates and are not meant to be whole house treatment devices, only room specific for most commonly occupied areas.As of 8:30 pm the tvoc meter in my office was reading 1.239 mg/m3, current reading as of 2:01am is 1.07 mg/m3. No ventilation to the outside. Only natural aspiration via dryer/bathroom vent or air leaks.House is 1035 sqft so take that x2 ( for the open basement space all return air goes into ) then x8 for typical residential ceiling height = 16560 cuft (468.93 m3). The fans in these units are Noctua fans rated for 53.3 m3/hr. To treat the entire volume of my house once requires ~8.8 hrs using a single unit. Current spec is for max 660 sqft ( 5280 ft3 or 2.8 hr for 1 air change per space at unit flow rate ) and minimum of 100 sqft well ventilated for ozone safety ( 800 ft3 or 26min for 1 air change per space at unit flow rate )So real world use case: With that in mind, if you want to neutralize VOCs like say what Karen D left in her prior comment ( Acetone in nail polish remover for instance), using a few cotton swabs, the surface area of a nail, maybe a few tissues too that further add to surface area you're allowing said solvent to diffuse from, don't expect the purifier to magically cut the odor in a small time frame. Be realistic here.... it's not designed for that kind of fast removal activity. You would need a huge amount of catalyst surface area and airflow to keep up with the diffusion rate of such substances.Much more practical solution would be employing adequate mechanical negative ventilation to the outside in said affected space than trying to rely on an air purifier to do the job of fresh air replacement. Things like these are more of a final polish device that will pick up anything you haven't captured via another HEPA, carbon capture, germicidal UV sterilization or mechanical ventilation. So when buying these have realistic expectations to where and on what you are using it for.For me, they are doing what I need them to do at a slow rate but that's fine as it will meet target when I need it to based on the meter reading.For anyone worried about the negligible amount of ozone generated by these I setup a test using a calibrated Eco Sensors Model C-30Z Ozone monitor placed 18 inches from the unit on the end table in my office. Turned off my HVAC system for the night at 8:30 pm and closed the door. The room size is 9ft x 8.7 ft or 78.3 sq ft, well under their minimum room size and certainly not well ventilated with the door shut.Left it in this state until my morning alarm at 7am. The ozone monitor hadn't moved from the bottom indicator of the range which would be .02 ppm. However I could certainly smell it in the space.The human olfactory sensitivity is 0.003 \u2013 0.015 ppm depending on your particular biology. So you will likely smell it before any monitoring device indicates elevated exposure levels above the normal 0.01 ppm natural background levels you would expect to find out in the country side away from industrial areas and citys. EPA current exposure limits for ground-level ozone is 0.070 ppm, averaged over an 8-hour period. AQI Value | Ozone Level (ppm)Good 0-50 | 0.000-0.054Moderate  51-100 | 0.055-0.070Unhealthy for sensitives\t                   101-150 | 0.071-0.085Unhealthy   151-200 | 0.086-0.105Hazardous  201-300 | 0.106-0.200The breakpoint for \u201cgood\u201d air quality is 0.054, which converts to about 0.106 mg/m\u00b3, about the same as the WHO\u2019s recommended limit of 0.1 mg/m\u00b3.But based on the simple real world check above, do I think it will increase the ozone in my house to dangerous levels...not likely...but you can take that how you want. Every home's outdoor air exchange rates are different so if you have a very tight home....maybe...but it's going to take a long time to do it. Want to know for sure, buy your own monitor. Alot of other equipment in your house also generates Ozone (TVs, hair dryers, etc)."

When I connected both devices, the app gets confused and if I change the settings on one, it changes both.  Not sure how it gets it's wires crosses, but it does.

Pros: The Air Oasis accomplishes its mission and purifies the air. I used to sneeze several times throughout the day, even after cleaning the house. Now with this machine, I rarely sneeze in my house. Thank you for making a product that is ready to go out of the box and making a product that works.

          "Contenu": "** UPDATE: 5/3/2022 **Within hours after posting our initial review, AirOasis reached out and offered to send replacement UV-C bulbs at no cost to us.  In fact, the bulbs arrived only a few days after our review posted.  The bulbs were easy to install and restored our air purifiers to perfect working condition.  Two representatives followed-up with us to make sure our concerns were fully addressed; they greatly appreciated us taking the time to share our feedback and they acted promptly to make things right.  Given that the company responded promptly and took such good care to remedy our problem, we recommend AirOasis and their iAdaptAir purifiers; the units are making a noticeable difference in our air quality in our home.  We know the company stands behind their products and wants to please their customers before *and* after the sale.--- Original Review ---Our family is a little disappointed in our experience with Air Oasis.  The iAdaptAir purifiers have respectable technology built-in, however, after only a few months of using two of their \"large\" units, we experienced problems with three UV-C lamps burning out (one lamp on the one unit, two lamps on the other).  The customer service reps were extremely friendly and courteous to deal with, however, the warranty policy is not as customer-centric as we had hoped.  Instead of shipping out replacement UV-C lamps (or potentially whole new units) upfront, the company makes you first ship the two large purifiers back to them at the CUSTOMER'S expense (quite costly as these are a few feet tall and rather heavy), then wait for a \"credit\" to be applied to your Air Oasis account (once the company receives the tracking #s for the original units being sent back).  The customer can then purchase brand new units to be shipped using the \"credit\" applied to the account by Air Oasis.Our biggest issue with this process is having to absorb the large expense and hassle of shipping the \"faulty\" units back, along with the delay time  turning everything around; we have a frustrating mold problem in our home we're trying to get ahead of and these filters have mitigated our allergies to a certain degree.  We don't want to be without (partially) functioning units for an extended period as we wait for the replacement units.  Also, we disposed of the original shipping/product boxes months ago; finding boxes and packing materials to ship these rather odd-shaped machines back is a challenge.  Additionally only the UV-C lamps were problematic, the rest of the units were fine... why be forced to return both of the purifiers themselves?  The company should design the machines for easy swap-out of the UV-C bulbs by the customer as they need to be replaced periodically anyway.We feel Air Oasis should send replacement units to the customer upfront, along with pre-paid labels to have the defective units sent back.  This allows the customer to keep the partially functioning filters running as they wait for the replacements, then the customer can slip the defective units into the new boxes from the replacement units afterward.  If customer fails to send the original units back, Air Oasis can reserve the right to charge customer for the replacement units (via a credit card on file).  Better still, simply send out inexpensive replacement UV-C bulbs for the customer to replace at their convenience.  This makes for a much better warranty process overall.  It also demonstrates Air Oasis' commitment to the customer and their willingness to stand behind their products, especially \"high end\" models like these.Lastly, these air purifiers are NOT inexpensive... these are the company's \"flagship\" home air purifiers and the large models we purchased were around $600 per unit with replacement filters costing just under $100.  The company should make any warranty claims easier and less expensive for customers who shell out this much money upfront for a quality, state-of-the-art product.  Having UV-C bulbs last much longer than a few months on two different units, would be a bonus as well.We hope this review helps others make informed decisions about doing business with Air Oasis.  We will continue to use these partially-functioning units for awhile (with diminished UV-C purification) and look to other companies in the future for alternative air purifier purchases."

I'm convinced they worked to keep the rest of the family from getting COVID-19 when one family member had it last November. Whether the ultraviolet light or the HEPA filter or both, the rest of us managed to stay well even though the sick person didn't realize at first it was Covid and had yet to isolate themselves. One of the best investments I've made for our home."
