On the surface, it's great and easy to use, but behind the scenes in terms of true functionality and management, it's frustrating.  My biggest complaint though is the lack of support.  You have to send an email and then wait for an answer which is usually more questions because they never understand your question.  If they understood inventory, they would understand the question.  I truly don't think it's worth the headache."

It really limits what I can do and how I can use it for my business. Seems like your pricing plan hasn't evolved as your platform has grown. For example, my scheduling/timecard company just has a flat, pay per user fee (Deputy - look them up). No questions from me on their pricing and it lets me decide what is right for my business.

There were so many moving pieces to track such as: current assets, what was being donated, brought along, or sold. Not to mention the tracking of new inventory and making sure everything was received and in its location. Our situation was unique but even after the move we will continue to use Sortly to log and track our assets and inventory, its so convenient and user friendly. There is no other app or service out there that gives you so much for the small price of $30 a month.  We cannot recommend Sortly enough! I tell everyone I know about them!"

          "Contenu": "As an Executor of a large Estate, I have successfully  used the Sortly Inventory Management App now for over 2 years. Sortly by far was the easiest to use inventory management system of the number of ones I originally tested out. In my early days, I greatly welcomed and appreciated the help of the Sortly App support team. The App is extremely easy to operate by the Owner/Manager/Executor and his Staff. It was also very easy to add or remove my \u201cclients or customers\u201d and change \u201caccess permission levels\u201d whenever, as required.  The Photo based inventory with many additional descriptions, etc. was simply perfect for a diverse group of beneficiaries with widely varying tech skills. Most importantly, as \u201cOwner\u201d, I found the App to be remarkably stable and robust. I have never had even one instance of of \u201cdowntime or instability\u201d even with dozens of persons in various global locations working with the Sortly App platform. I highly recommend Sortly, in every respect. I confirm I have absolutely no affiliation in any respect with Sortly. I am simply a satisfied, grateful, happy customer. Sortly is simply The Best of the Bunch!!!"
