I paid too much money for this to just be garbage. I do not recommend these cards to anyone.Edit: Still waiting on customer service. I emailed them before I posted this review and it\u2019s been 2 days since they claimed they contacted me.Edit 2: they finally messaged me for the first time after the bad reviews, not responding to my first email that I sent to their site. Then they respond with that I finally answered even though they have NEVER emailed me. Such a rude company.Another update: even though I told the company I DID NOT want more cards, just a refund - they sent more cards anyways and they STILL have little dots all over the picture. And they still haven\u2019t refunded me!! NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY."

And then delayed again. I was told it was delivered, went to the mailbox, nothing.  And then it went back to 'being delivered' and 'processing'. And back and forth from one county to another, each link for the package tracking saying a different thing. It did finally arrive, after I sourced a comparable card set that I nearly bought, almost a week into June. So, not satisfied with delivery estimates, but satisfied with how it works."

It is difficult to differentiate between most of the Link cards (The toon link cards barely look any different from other Link cards) and Zelda having brown hair on some of them (for whatever reason) doesn't help either. Nevertheless the Amiibo NFC Cards themselves work perfectly fine and the quality of said cards is good as well. It took about 10 days to arrive which is in the spectrum of 7-12 days they have provided, so I'm mostly satisfied."

I just wanted one. I would be happy with one. I thought it would be nice to get just the one that was broken, and one additional one. I even offered to pay for the additional one.Recommendation:They do work, and if your first set comes in. Make sure to test them all. The team does make sure you get what you ordered. If you need any of them urgently, I don't recommend getting them here. If there is an issue it will take a while and you will end up with a whole lot of unnecessary extras."

To me, that shows how much this company values their customer satisfaction and I really appreciate it. Original postI bought these cards about a month ago and they all worked flawlessly. I noticed the cards started to give me issues about a week ago where some of the cards wouldn't scan no matter what I did from restarting the game to moving around to a more open spaced area. The cards wouldn't scan. Sometimes the card scans but no items drop immediately. There's too much hangtime in that matter. Even as I write this review I'm still having issues with some cards not working anymore. The biggest culprit being the Sheik card. I'm disappointed overall with how these cards fail when they stated that it'll work 100% of the time."

          "Contenu": "Found this site while searching for Amiibo Cards for BOTW on Switch. This site had a variety of options to choose from on how many cards I wanted. The prices were fantastic and even got a few dollars of with a code on their site. The only thing that was a downside was the shipping. It took almost 3 weeks to receive them because they came from China. But I emailed the site and they got back to me in a day and did their best to take care of me and make sure I was happy. I finally received the cards and they are absolutely perfect. They are about as small as a Nintendo Switch game. The art on them is fantastic and have a very sturdy feel where they don\u2019t feel like breaking (They still have to be handled carefully though). They work amazingly with BOTW and I couldn\u2019t be any happier. I will certainly be buying the Animal Crossing cards (all the sets) for my next purchase. Thank you ZELDACARDS! You got another satisfied customer."

I was reluctant to purchase two sets in fear of overlapping cards, but between the 90 card set and the 42 there were absolutely zero duplicates. I would highly recommend these Micro Animal Crossing Amiibo cards to anyone that is looking to increase their collection."
