But when trying to go to the online site to activate my account and setup my user nane and password, it only redirects me to the login site (Which it won't let me create). I called customer service, waited for over 10 minutes on hold. Then a represenative picked up the phone (I could hear them breathing) and they did not speak when I said hello. They simply hung up on me. So the website is crap! The customer service reps have no skills, and I am stuck with a crap phone for at least this month and I will be charged another $50 for a restocking fee when I do get out of this P.O.S. company."

          "Contenu": "I signed my elderly mom up for this service as she has dementia and is having a hard time working a cell phone. I so wanted this to work.Shipping was an issue. I typed in my mom's address but the web browser generated an extra digit. I didn't notice until after I placed the order. I sent a message back as soon as I noticed this. Never got a response. When I called they told me I had to contact the shipping company. I had to call twice because I had never heard of the shipping company and needed to get contact info. Got a hold of the shippers to get them to send the device to the right address. Got billed. 2 weeks later I finally got the device. Hooked up the device. It didn't work well. Cell service in my mom's assisted living is poor. She lives downstairs and I have verizon and calls are poor. Her device said 5 bars though?  but every other call was put to voice mail and then she couldn't dial out and when we finally hooked up it dropped calls. Very frustrating. Especially for someone with dementia. She needs reliable communication to family and doctors. So I wanted to cancel and get something reliable. This is where they kept wanting me to fix the problem. I was even refered to amazon to buy equipment to make it work. Also was told I could buy cell phones. She can't use those. Also told they could crank up the boosting to help her get service. Haha. Yeah right. Got billed a month while they \"problem solved\". Also whenever I got \"tech\" support it was from over seas. If I said something off script they didn't know how to reply. Communication with language was an issue. I spent 30 minutes explaining under no uncertain terms that we were canceling. When they finally got the message I wasn't refunded all of the cost because I wouldn't trouple shoot with them. It says on their website they would. Shame on them becaue they work with elderly people and I'm sure if I wasn't there to help my mom she would have been scammed out of the whole amount. I would never refer someone to this company."

Instructions provided, along with a notice that we will be charged a restocking fee; $50.00 on a new phone; $30.00 on a used phone.  We were never informed as to which we had.  I am infuriated because I realize I have a used one.  Whoever had the phone previous to us apparently could not get the base open to install a battery.  We could not, either, though we tried for several hours to do so.  Our monthly Social Security income in this household is $2400.00.  Also, is the purchase price of your base the same for a used device as to a new one?  The whole scenario seems totally unfair to us.Sincerely,Thom and Beverly Sertich"

The answer I got was  (after I had to explain the problem about 3 times) \u201cwell if hasn\u2019t worked we might as well just remove it.\u201d I submitted an online request to correct the name that comes up for our caller id.  That was supposed to take affect in a couple days. About a week later it\u2019s still not working and they said they never got the request. Supposedly that was taken care of tonight and it should be correct in about 3 days. And then they were charging me (which I didn\u2019t know about) an extra $9 a month for the robocall feature. I Immediately canceled that feature as soon as I noticed it on my bill but it is still not removed.  However the rep said that I am not paying for it and he doesn\u2019t know why I still have it. It is supposed to be taken off of my account as well. I paid for 3 months service at once to save a few dollars but was informed that I wouldn\u2019t be able to cancel within this time frame and if I wanted to cancel I would have to call right at the end of the 3 months to cancel the service. So if and when I do cancel this service it\u2019s probably going to be a nightmare. The phone does have good service in my little rural area so that is a plus."

          "Titre": "Horrible Company",
          "Contenu": "If I can give 0 stars I would.  This is the worst telephone company in the USA.  They are a total SCAM.  What makes it worst my mom is a senior citizen on a fixed income and they still ripped her off.  All we wanted was a landline with voicemail and caller ID. Even though I read they had caller ID.  What they are saying now is for outbound caller id.  Whoever heard of just having a caller id that for outbound calls only?  People want to see who is calling.  So I write a complaint I want caller ID or I am canceling.  What they do is send me a new SIM card which I thought was to get my mom caller id but now I know I was wrong. They just send me the SIM card to appease me.  I put in the new SIM card now my mom has no phone service.  I called support and sat on hold for 40 minutes then the representative tells me my new SIM card had to be activated and it will take two hours.  Needless to say, the SIM card never activated,  so my mom was without phone service for the weekend because now according to tech, it will take 2 hours to activate but instead, it never happened.  I sent a message to the salesperson and I am sure she got her commission so did not care and I told her I want a refund.  Her response was she was sorry and sent my request to the billing department.  Needless to say, it has been over a week the billing department has not given my mom common courtesy to call her back or call me back or send a refund. So many issues with this company in just 3 weeks: I was on hold for 2 hours trying to reach support because we could not figure out the voicemail.  After 2 hours I get a pre-recorded message the reps are busy call back and the call disconnects.   Spoke with rep Luis made an appointment with me to call me back at 6:00pm needless to say he did not call.  He called me back 45 minutes late unacceptable. Do not spend any money with this company Run as fast as you can.  They are ripping over senior citizens who still would like to enjoy a landline in their homes. My poor mom, hopefully, will get a refund and she will not be out over $200 something dollars.  This company really sucks."

          "Contenu": "I had Sprint Phone Connect 3 as my landline for several years. I absolutely loved it. The phone unit cost less than $40.00. The phone connections were reliable. The calls were always crisp and clear. And I NEVER, EVER, EVER\u00a0 had any dropped calls. I never needed to call tech support. The cost was extremely affordable at only $15.00 per month. Unfortunately, it was a 3G device which Sprint, now part of T-mobile, discontinued supporting around January,\u00a0 2022.\u00a0I found Community Phone on the internet. It sounded like a way to still have a landline. I started as a customer in November, 2021. I am NOT happy with this replacement product. I had to purchase their device (the Landline Base) for a one-time, upfront fee of $99.00. I wasn't happy about that but assumed it had 4G or 5G technology in it, so I accepted that requirement.I am still using the same cordless\u00a0phone units which I previously used successfully with Sprint Phone Connect 3. Sound quality was always great with Sprint.\u00a0Now with Community Phone, the quality of the sound during calls is bad. With my volume turned all the way up, the first several minutes of a call are faint. It improves only slightly later in the call. I find that parts of the conversations are not very clear.And the number of calls that are dropped or just end abruptly for no reason at all is intolerable. There is no warning when it might happen. I have never experienced this with any other phone company in my life. On my end there is a loud screeching noise.\u00a0 I can try to talk, but the person on the other end doesn't hear anything, just silence, no sounds. This happens A LOT, way too often. Recently, when someone calls me and I answer, we both hear a loud dee-dee-dee sound, and the dee-dee-dee noise just keeps repeating. We have to hang up and redial. Sometimes we get a normal connection,\u00a0 but sometimes we get the weird dee-dee-dee sounds again.I set up voice mail with Community Phone. Big mistake. I was dissatified with how it works. Once activated the Community Phone voice mail cannot be deactivated per tech support. I like to use my answering machine on my cordless phone. It is much simpler than trying to access the Community Phone message system. I called tech support several times for a solution.  I asked them to cancel my voice mail setup, but they said that cannot be done.  They claim they fixed it so that there would be more (4 or more) rings before my voicemail message kicks in, but it is still 3 rings.  I am not impressed with their tech support staff. And the monthly cost for Community Phone is more than triple what I paid with Sprint. I pay almost $49.00 per month for much, much worse service. The Senior Discount is only good for 3 months and then it disappears forever.I wanted to post reviews on Google and Yelp, but it seems Community Phone has several addresses which don't seem to work for Yelp or Google. So I have left reviews with the BBB, with Google (for Community Phone landlines in Illinois} and Trustpilot.I am looking for alternatives because with Community Phone, the quality of the phone connection is poor, connectivity is highly unreliable, and\u00a0 calls are routinely dropped, and tech support is inadequate. It has been a frustrating experience for me and the people who call me."

          "Contenu": "From day one starting Nov. 22, 2022 I had nothing but problems with recordings to redial again, dropped calls in the middle of conversations being hung up on and various forms of interference with the person I called fading in and out with static. I spent more time on chats than I did using the phone. I kept saying how imperative a reliable phone was because I was in the middle of renovating my new house dealing with a bunch of contractors. I had to return calls when I was interrupted with a busy signal and hung up on explaining I didn't hang up on them it was the phone. That and the fact that I am on a 100% disability from my war wounds received in Vietnam and needed the phone for emergencies. I was told time an time again to try the same thing over and over with no results of fixing what I know to be a flaw in the technology. I reset the base several times then moved it to another room. All of which showed the green lights to the right of the base lit up. I was told the signal was very good so that wasn't the problem. I heard apology after apology for over 2 and a half months, which started to be annoying. It was like a child breaking an article of value and saying they were sorry thinking that covered the problem. I started to keep a phone log of all of the interruptions and dealings that went on and posted a complaint on Facebook. After months of hating the phone every time I used it fearing it would ruin my day trying to make contact with people, I was told a new SIM card would be sent to fix the problem. On 2-2-23 I put the card in and was told to wait a couple of hours. When it didn't work I went on chats the next day and was told to put the old card that worked sometimes back in for the weekend. After that I contacted the agent on chats again asking what they wanted me to do and was told that the phone number was being synced up with the new card and would take a few hours. Several days later on the 8th I got a call from Ibrahim trying to tell me the phone was ready to go but the sound was muffled and breaking up really bad so I could only get a word or two every now and then. I told the guy that I couldn't understand half of what he was saying. He said he could hear me clearly on his end but I couldn't hear him. He asked that I call a number to confirm a better signal so, I said I would call a friend and let him know. I called a friend a couple of miles away and heard a crackling sound of interference missing some of his words but it was better than the other call. When I hung up I called a business to place and order for vitamins and got the same interference. I reported that back to the guy and finally gave up. I wanted my money back for the year that I paid in advance and cancelled the service. On the weekend just before canceling I placed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau after knowing that this issue was never going to stop. I got a second email from them a couple of days ago saying they haven't gotten a response from the company. In my response to them I added that I had zero service for several days. I stopped using the phone all together and disconnected it. I went to chats again to cancel the service and spent about another hour going back and forth. I did the cancellation form and got back an odd part of the questionnaire. It asked a yes or no question about using a portal to I believe keep the number assigned to another company. I said no and after the question it had one word, \"false.\" Not knowing what that was I added that to chats. Considering that I was told I would hear back in 24 hours and it's been over 2 days I went on this sight to see that others are being screwed royally. Lastly, being a former law enforcement officer losing my job from my pre- existing war wounds, I have made some contacts in my state's government regarding fraud and deceptive business practices. I will take this next steps up the ladder if I don't get a positive response. Enough is enough of bad business."

This is the perfect phone set up for my elderly mother and the purchase process and set up couldn't have been any easier. You even ported over her old number which was very important to her. My mother has been the target of local fraudsters and having the call log is very beneficial. It also helps when she says that someone called but she cant remember who it was. Please let me know when you will be able to provide the call log and once i have it, I will be happy to update your rating!"

The second is that it has had to be rebooted twice now, and when that happens, she can't do it herself.  I  have to drive to her house and perform the task of removing the back cover and inserting a toothpick or paperclip into the tiny hole in the back to reboot it, then wait for the lights to all come back on.  This procedure had to be performed 3 times last week to get it to reset correctly. The third is that the device needs to be placed in a window in order to pick up the best signal, which is not always convenience if you have no window sills or tables in front of a window.  Again, none of these issues would deter me from using this device or recommending it to anyone that needs just a phone and doesn't have a reasonable local phone company option.  Overall, I give it 4 stars."

          "Contenu": "Simple to set up. This landline connection is interfaced with and Dependent on cell towers for transmission of signal. This is an indication of the obsolescence of hard wired equipment available for secure and more dependable phone service. The old technology was and still is greatly appreciated, but has largely been replaced by cell phone and cell tower repeaters to relay the communications (antenna) streams. The changeover to internet providers for regular phone service, commercial, industrial, and small businesses are not excluded. This COMMUNITY PHONE is Not a party line, which certainly would be considered a totally UNSECURED LINE for personal and/or private communications. This Community Phone requires a 120VAC outlet to power this unit continuously. When power is lost, you can expect service to continue. This service will switch automatically to BATTERY BACKUP! Battery life has not been reported in the setup instructions and list of components in the package when shipped to the customers. I lost power and the phone worked just fine. Note: You must purchase a landline handset for service upon installation. The regular phone jacks for landlines still are the connection ports for signal incoming and the handset to make or receive phone calls. Still assessing service quality while speaking. So far clear and line-noise free. Good job by Community Phone up to this point."

It is easy to set up and it is very reliable as it operates through widely available cell systems. I took it out of the box and had it set up and operating within maybe 45 mins. AND the price is very reasonable, and beats all the other phone services."

I immediately called the company and spoke with Charles in the Onboarding Dept. He went above and beyond his duty to help me and by the next day he called and had figured out the problem and fixed it. I could call out and receive calls with no problems. I was using a temporary number and Charles ported in my number I wanted transferred and my phone is working fine. I had never seen such wonderful customer service from any company. Charles called me many times during this process and was very concerned about me and spent much time on solving the problem and getting me hooked up properly. I really appreciate all that he did and am very grateful to him. I was so worried about tranferring my number and that I would lose it and he reassured me that he would make sure I didn't lose it. The other customer service representatives  have been helpful too but Charles really is outstanding. I have never seen any company with people like Charles who go out of their way to make sure the customer is satisfied. Thank you Charles. You put me at ease and I'm really enjoying my Community phone system. I would highly recommend Community Phone to anyone who wants a landline phone. You can really depend on them."

The greeting they hear is the initial one I set up and then it goes to that voice mail box. It apparently isn't switching to my Home Phone number all the time. Doesn't happen all the time but it's getting annoying. And sometimes in the middle of a conversation, it just goes silent/disconnects and I have to call that  party back. Small but irritating glitches. Thats why I can't rate it any higher.UPDATE:After posting this, I got an email and phone call from Community Phone. They got with me and we did some setting changes on my end and their end. The result seems to be that calls coming in now are properly switched to my home phone. Time will tell if this is fixed but I have faith that the problem is solved. I want to thank them for their prompt and courteous response to an aggravating situation. So I will raise my rating to a 5 STAR and be a happy customer.  Isaac"
