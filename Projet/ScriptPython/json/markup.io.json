Would gladly recommend MarkUp to friends and family!"

          "Contenu": "Markup is such a handy tool! I think the biggest improvement that Markup could make would be to allow the user to update a link in a project that already has edits. We are doing edits on a dev site and the dev link expires after about two days. Which means my developer has to be ready to go, to knock out all of the edits in two days or he will have no idea what Im referring to. The screenshots are definitely helpful, but it would be great if it just allowed up to update the link. The site isn't changing so dramatically that the pins would be super off if it reloaded. Just a tip! Hope that helps!"
