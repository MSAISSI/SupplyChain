If you don't count 7 emails and still no real resolution as hassle free. Item has to be unused to return. So you can't try a speaker to see if you like it, even if it is not defective just low quality you can't really return it.  Has to be unused to return it. So hope you like it , if not your SOL. Any issues, they will blame on you or your system.

I seem that the baskets and designs are the same as d4s, big Jeffs audio, def once etc etc. There is a general company that makes these speakers magnets etc etc so I def recommend buying somewhere else. THEY WILL NOT REFUND ME ANY ITEMS they say send the troop backs for basically2/3 of the money they keep all shipping so you are actually paying for shipping. IF YOU BUY THROUGH AMAZON YOU ACTUALLY GET 100% of money back but not through ct isn't that crazy. THIS COMPANY IS HORRIBLE"

Upon installing the amp, I discovered that it is way under powered for these subs.  Literally 2 days later, I contacted the company about the \"no questions asked\" return policy and was told they don't accept returns of anything that been \"used\".  They were willing to make an exception for me, but it would cost me $60.  I paid $160 for the amp and they were going to credit me $100 towards a larger amp.  I realize that this is a large company and that my total purchase of nearly $400 is insignificant to them, but it's a lot of money for us working folks.

The plastic the subwoofer comes in looks like it was all crushed up & then they just put the subwoofer back into it. Also there is like crumbs or something onto the top of it. The stickers/ manual Was also all messed up as well. Also the chrome is already getting rusted bad. It also has a smell to it, not like the others or normal smell.  I never had a bad experience with the 1st and 2nd subwoofer I ordered, I was pretty happy with it till now. I\u2019m not the type to give bad reviews or anything but when you spend over 100$+ you would like it to be new."

I reached out to CT and they told me to send it back but they charged me $20 shipping even though it wasn't my fault. Then I was told that they couldn't send me a replacement because that amp line was getting new heat sinks. I asked could I try something else then they asked my setup with I told them was 4 CT 8\" subs ending with 1 ohm. So they suggested to strap 2 CT-1500 amps together so I had to buy them at axtra cost. I received the amps just to find out that if strapped they would go down to only 2 ohms which won't work for me. They told me to send those back and charged me $20 shipping again. Then they suggested a AT-3000 amp which was $200 more so I just had them send me 4 6x9s and 2 6 1/2s and called it a day. So overall, I lost money and did not get what I really wanted."

My first purchase was flawless, so I am giving CTS 5 stars based on that purchase. My most recent purchase deserves a1 star review.\u00a0My project will not be ready to start for about another 3 months, but I wanted to take advantage of their Black Friday promotion which offered a 23 % discount on their items. I ordered an amplifier and two sets of speakers. Prior to them shipping the items, I sent them an email letting them know that I had made a mistake on one of the speaker sizes and needed to modify my order. I gave them the option to correct the speaker size at that time, prior to shipping, or I could take the order as processed and check fitment, whatever was easiest for them. It was their\u00a0recommendation to take the order as is and that I could exchange if the item did not fit.I received my order quickly, and within an hour of receiving the CTS equipment, I sent an email to CTS requesting an exchange as the items did not fit.Being that I had to reduce the size of the speakers, I also needed to exchange the amplifier as it was too powerful for the smaller speakers that I would ultimately need. I contacted customer service, and they said it was not a problem and that a return label would be sent asap so that I could return the equipment.Once I got the equipment in the mail back to CTS, I asked how the refund or store credit would be processed. I was expecting that whatever I purchased or exchanged would also come with a 23% discount since my initial purchase was made within that Black Friday sales window. However, that did not happen. I was given a cash refund for the cost of the equipment, however I was not refunded the state tax on that equipment. And, not only that, CT Sounds also applies a City of Houston Tax (I have not seen that and I am a Texas resident). That is a significant amount considering the size of the purchase I made. If CTS would have given me the same discount that I received with my initial\u00a0purchase, I would be fine paying for the cost to ship back the items.\u00a0Saying all that, CTS has been very courteous and professional through this situation, but I am disappointed with how it was handled. If I sent an email prior to shipment and it is their recommendation to check fitment and then make a decision, I think they should take care of a repeat customer and extend the discount that was given to make the original purchase. I am not writing this review to influence anyone not to purchase from CT Sounds. As previously mentioned, their customer service reps were very courteous both prior to and after the purchase. But I will say this, you need to know what you need prior to ordering because\u00a0if you don't and an exchange is necessary, you might end up paying some money for items that you will never use (state/city taxes)."

The subs I bought meso 10s  are nothing short of phenomenal. No complaints they sound great. The issue I had was the sub enclosure I bought from them. I checked and double checked to see if the meso would fit in this enclosure and the website has a green check mark confirming. The sub enclosure opening is listed at 9.45\" and the sub listed the cutout size as 9.29\" perfect right? The big day arrived and my subs wouldn't fit. The cutout was to small. So I contacted customer support and was told to sand the box to make them fit. I paid good money to not have to worry about this and did my homework to make sure of compatibility. All they had to do is make it right offer a replacement. But then communication just stopped after I told them I probably wouldn't purchase from them again. This would have been a 5 star glowing review had it not been for the customer service rep that had no interest in making this right."

I can get angry very fast and I apologize, but I do not like the sound quality. I have tried many class D amps from big brand names. What makes me the most upset is how I read \"CT Sounds is so sure that you will love our audio products, that we offer a 100% money back guarantee for 30 days. This isn\u2019t your typical money back guarantee, because it\u2019s truly a no questions asked guarantee.\", but when I went to the return process they said \"If we discover the item was used we will not issue a refund or store credit. However, we will give you the option to send the item back to you at your cost + $30 processing fee + the original pre-paid return label.\" They just were telling me that you can return it for any reason even if \"You don't like the quality of the product for any reason\".I am broken and don't know what to do, I think I just lost over $200. I put it back in the box and I don't know what I am going to do with it. I might call them and see what they say over the phone, but at this point I'm not sure."

So while I am disappointed, the quality of their products that I already own make it worth while dealing with a rare issue. As long as it is a rare issue I will continue to build my system using CT sounds products. The stereo will be the only part of my system that isn't CT products. It's my first complete system build , and I want all matching equipment. So while it isn't a five Star review I would still buy from them again as long as they fix my issue."

The warrantee sticker was removed and you can see torque marks on the screws on the bottom of the amp, but the amp came back in working condition. They charge me $30 to send it back and I didn\u2019t even have it altogether. I spent $280 on an amp that was worth maybe 200. I am very upset that I had to pay $30 to get my amplifier sent back to me when the warranty and everything should\u2019ve covered that if you purchase something from CT sounds make sure you do not plan on returning it, or you better have more money to send it back-and-forth because it\u2019s not free"

          "Contenu": "I purchased my vehicle in 2021. It had CT sounds audio equipment in it, I had honestly never heard of ct sounds before. It has done great. I decided I wanted to upgrade from my 2 tropo 8in subwoofers and I bought 2 tropo xl 12in subwoofers. The amplifier I had running the 8in subwoofers is a ct sounds 1000.1D, I was told it was all installed by a shop and tuned so I left it wired how it was but did check and it was wired to a 1ohm load. It has done great until I got my new subwoofers yesterday September 27th, 2023. I am a technician at a certified Chevrolet dealership and I followed the schematic on the ct sounds website to wire both of my new 4ohm dvc 12in subwoofers to a 1ohm load. I powered up my car and was excited to hear my new equipment, sadly my amplifier was not working right, as soon as you power it on, it will flicker between protect and a non-protect state, it will gradually speed up until it is flickering very very fast. The amplifier is rated for a 1ohm load but unfortunately it did not handle it, I like the equipment and I understand things do break, I ordered the ct sounds 1500.1D as a replacement/upgrade for my new subwoofers and DO NOT plan to use the mono capability of the amplifier and instead wire each subwoofer independently at a 2ohm load. I hope this will not cause my new amplifier to repeat what my old one did, that is why I only give a 4 star review instead of a 5, my old amplifier has a 2020 sticker on the back of it so I know it is not very old, it unfortunately did not last. I hope my new equipment lasts longer, I am looking forward to my new amplifier and am hoping it works for years to come."

The kicker kx was still better. Can't get them anymore unfortunately. I'm really happy with the subs, wish I would of just went with the T2500 from fossgate. This amp goes into protection mode and clips before even getting the subs warmed up. Not super happy with the amp the sound is just different not as good and kinda expensive for what you get. Subs are amazing"
