After a week of my order, they told me I was banned (I wasn\u2019t on the whole week since they told me not to play the game while the order is being processed) and proceeded to blame the ban on me. Also after a week a little before this incident, they finally emailed me saying that they had a massive change on prices (this is said after a whole WEEK of me waiting for my order) and I ordered 800k vc and they said they could only do 364k vc max even though i paid for 800k and waited a WHOLE WEEK for my order.

After purchasing some items for Diablo 2 Resurrection I was asked to send the following screenshots; including the last 4 numbers of my debit card used, and the transaction ID. I sent those over and I was then asked to see a picture of my debit card for \"Security purposes to make sure I'm not a kid and that I want this.\" Finally I just had enough and asked them to just refund my order and I will buy else where. Shortly after, they decided the information that I sent over was good enough. I've purchased from other sellers before and I have NEVER been asked to do these silly things.*Update* I spoke with the team and they apologized for the troubles and offered a coupon for compensation, which I declined. But for their kind gesture and thoughts, I would like to raise the rating to 2 stars.(The representative that assisted me was just doing their job and the representative was helpful. My rating reflects my overall experience with the company and not a specific individual or encounter.)"

I kept asking how to get it and I was told at first to open my gate, then they said come to us but they took forever to give me the dado code then I couldn\u2019t find the villager I bought.

The guy from the customer support chat told me to wait over and over again. I told them that is was getting late and I had to go to bed. They then thought it was a good idea to call my phone in the middle of the night, waking me up. I did not answer because it was a unknown number and I wanted to go back to sleep.Next morning I check my phone and see I have a new voice message. They asked me to come online and that they had my order.I then write in the chat on the IGGM website asking about my order. They say they have it and that I should come online in the game.I start my game and wait. 30 minutes later I write in their chat again.They say they have my order and that I should wait. After about 10 - 15 minutes they contact me and I finally got my order.I also want to add that the guy from customer support never gave me any straight answers and his english was not the best. I had to write several times asking how long it would take even though that was the first thing I asked in my first message. Finally I wrote that I wanted a straight answer on how long I would have to wait and no \"asap\" or anything like that. He told me a few hours.I will never buy anything from IGGM again.I bought from them because it said that it would probably only take about 15 minutes to get my order. It did not.The only reason I give this review two stars instead of one, is that I finally got my order."

          "Contenu": "For the price that they charge they really need to do a better job of communicating. On the website I was told that a discord channel would be set up for me to be able to easily communicate with the booster. However, I was told they wouldn't do it and to just contact them through their live support chat. The Live support agents were generally quick to respond though so that was a plus but they are not the ones boosting the character so a lot of the times if you have questions they won't be able to answer. Even though the website said an estimate of 7 days to complete the boost, the live agent had told me it would be done in 5 days so I set my expectations accordingly. However, the booster didn't even log onto my character until the 3rd day and ended up taking the full 7 days even though I was told, on 2 separate occasions, that it would be 5 days. Finally, I had logged onto my character before the boost was finished as I needed the account back to raid with my guild and checked on the progress and leveled my character a bit before giving it back to the booster to complete. When I got my character back, I noticed that they had taken nearly 500-600 gold from my character at that point. When I asked about this, the agent was rude and said that they should have taken more gold as they only leave me account with the gold that was there when they get it and don't leave any of the gold earned through questing during the boost. This would have been fine had they communicated this to me. It does not say on their website either that this is what they do. I have seen other services that charge the same but will leave all the gold earned during questing on the character. I will not be using their services again and do not recommend that anyone else do so as well."

Just be honest with your customers up front because I\u2019m sure they wouldn\u2019t mind. They would just like to know because it makes it less shady. That\u2019s all I got!

They then said they would just mail it since I wasnt right there, I said ok no problem. 3 hours later, came on to do pre bedtime dailies real quick, and I had no gold in my mail lol.... so I checked with them, apparently they'd sent it 2.5 hours after they asked to meet me, and it was only 2/3 of what I ordered. The next day when I logged on, the other 1/3 of what I purchased was in there. It was a little messy for sure, Why would they call me late at night, offer to give it to me right there, then have it take them hours just to give me a partial amount of my purchase? It was cheaper than other gold services, yes, and overall I did get my gold at a good price, but I wouldn't recommend them if you need gold the same day. Maybe use them if you don't care about waiting 12-24 hours and saving like 5% off the price of other gold services."

Lucas issued my refund after I was tired of waiting to see what the issue was. If you don't mind waiting a couple of days, then this is the service you need. I think IGGM needs to reorganize their breakdown of how the process works, and give much more clear directions on what is needed after the payment process.

Another hour later, I still didn't get to speak to anyone and there's no one online again.It's definitely a strange experience and I have no idea if and when my issue is going to be resolved.Update: my order was fulfilled the next morning and the company reached out after the negative review, so I'm updating the score to 4/5.

And their chat support is always quick and efficient as I have dyslexia and mistype my battletag just about every other order and they get it fixed immediately. Honestly most of the time I\u2019ve had to wait longer than 20 mins for normal reasonable amount of mats was because I mistyped my battletag lol These ladies gentlemen at IGGM really do a great job and if you\u2019re going to spend real life money on in game items go with these guys as they are the best."
