I had several of my elderly family that reached out to me and didn't  want  to do the whole credit card thing, and they  just gave  me cash instead. Plus I have a couple friends that tried to donate and the app donated or charged more money than they were wanting to give. I also lost out on about fifty dollars because several people wanted to give 5 or ten but that was not allowed. You would think if you want money any amount would do. At this point I was not willing to front all of this money just so it could be donated.So therefore I just use my credit card after receiving cash from them so that he could get credit for multiple units.Instead the app only counted one unit when I had given seventy five dollars. I think there are a lot of glitches with this app and in the future we will not participate in thus."

I did not write anything asking my contacts to support my son.  Your colleagues took the liberty to do that for me without my consent.  Your system also sent messages out asking for support without our consent. I do not like the system asking anyone on our behalf for school support, using my son as the reason.  It make me feel I am not able to support my family.  I have had two contacts ask me \"what's going on with Austin?\"   \"Is something wrong?'  I don't mind using the system for products to purchase as a fund raiser.  I do not like the system asking my family or friends for money to support my son in PHS football.  Its embarrassing and humiliating to me and my family.Many of our friends are retired and do not use social media for anything.  We don't either."

Offering a team an ice cream party only open to the kids who sell more product and purposefully excluding team members who don't have the parent support structure to sell the product is hazing and bullying behavior. The kids who need community the most are left out of group bonding experiences... it makes me sick.  A product that can not be shipped further narrows the window of support a child can gather in the event extended family or friend networks reside more than 20 miles away. Making monetary contributions - which benefit the organization more than sales anyway - more expensive than purchasing a product (that most people can't purcahse anyway) felt very slimy. Additionally, if a fiscal contribution is made, it doesn't benefit the child as much as selling the product. The rep couldn't answer any questions about the app and did a poor job of creating enthusiasm or confidence in the product. The amount of profit contributed back to the organization was low for industry standard as well. In the future I will not participate in Money Dolley fundraisers even if it means my child is at a disadvantage in her sport."

Since we couldn\u2019t see the progress, we didn\u2019t push hard at all. Also, offering prizes makes for great incentives!When my daughter was first registering for this fundraiser, the instructions said to add contacts that are people who love and support her, but not family. That\u2019s the dumbest idea ever. Family is who supports kids the most! We later went ahead and added family and that's when she started having success.You really ought to come up with better food options to sell. In past experience, the jerky from fundraisers like these are very subpar. And since we have dietary restrictions, jerky is our only option to buy.I know my daughter had lots of people make monetary donations but it never changed her goal total. That needs to change! Monetary donations are even better than sales of a subpar product.I definitely wouldn\u2019t recommend using this fundraising platform to anyone unless major changes are made first. Good try though!"

While obviously, there's a few who have the disposable income and/or the heart for giving in support of the team, there are many others who do have the heart for giving, just not that much.  We need cheaper options, both in products and in donation only increments. She would have likely garnered many more donations and purchases with 5-10-15 dollar options."

This year he attempted the same thing and not a single person was interested since it wasn\u2019t a physical card. Also the minimum requirement for a monetary donation was to high. We tried to get family from out of town to do donations but they ended up purchasing a card that they couldn\u2019t use just to go with the cheaper option. Finally, when a person uses the digital format for to purchase a card or donation they are charged a fee. This turned away so many people because they wanted to do a simple $20 donation but was charged a fee to do so. As a small business owner I understand the price of service fees being passed onto the consumer but fundraisers should NEVER have a fee attached to them."

I had to check with my relative to make sure this wasn't a new / different campaign.  I asked MoneyDolly to stop texting me and they offered no way for me to opt out.  I encourage charities to realize how much they may alienate their membership by using this type of approach.  I think I got around six texts even after I donated.Also, I had no way to easily find out how much my granddaughter had raised.  That should be basic.Edit:  I DID use the \"STOP\" feature on my phone but that did not stop the texts from arriving.  I DID contact their support but got no response."

You can\u2019t say in your message that if you decide to give me money instead of purchasing the item, please enter your donation in smaller increments multiple times so I get more credit. Everyone else in the fundraiser gets the same profit I assume, except for the participant who is having to do all the asking and selling. That\u2019s not fair to the child. A $35 donation and a $100 donation should not be worth the same number of credits. If for example the item being sold cost $20 then someone that gives $100 should count for 5 credits. You should also allow someone to enter a donation amount in case they want to contribute but can\u2019t give at least $35. A $5 donation is still appreciated and helpful.Goals should be based on a total $$ amount and not units."

I had my chairperson account but then needed to use my husband\u2019s phone number for my daughter\u2019s account and could only login if he was around to give me the verification code.The second thing I wasn\u2019t fond of was the ranking system.  We typically choose our top sellers by dollar amount and not the number of units sold, it would be nice if you could choose how you would like them to be ranked.  Also, for the team rankings, if a student signed up but didn\u2019t sell anything, that significantly dropped the team\u2019s average number of units.  They\u2019re better off just not registering.

If they didn't buy i was going to get the last two for him a shirt.   Also many didn't like purchasing on line so they gave me the money and I had to purchase and had to eat the credit card fees.  Didn't like those fees.  Others were asking if there were other things to purchase besides the card.  I guess it was a pretty good fundraiser.  Hope they did well."

I do have a couple critiques regarding the donation side. First, I think it should allow for custom amounts rather than flat and the minimum should be the same price as the card. Second, each increment of a donation equal to a card purchase ($15 card or $15 donation) should equal 1 unit. For example, if I buy 2 cards, the player earns 2 units. But if I make a $35 donation he only earns one. Doesn't seem fair so we just had our customers buy the number of cards that would equal the amount they wanted to donate."

I am writing to express my gratitude for my incredible experience with the MoneyDolly fundraiser, particularly in support of our basketball team.From the very beginning, MoneyDolly made the fundraising process not just efficient but also enjoyable. The user-friendly platform allowed our supporters to contribute seamlessly, and the various features made it easy for us to share our team's story and goals. This accessibility played a crucial role in the success of our campaign.What truly set MoneyDolly apart was its ability to foster community around our basketball team. The platform was a virtual hub where coaches, supporters, teammates, and donors gathered to rally behind a shared passion. The engagement and encouragement we received through MoneyDolly were instrumental in boosting team morale and creating a positive atmosphere around our fundraising efforts.The updates and progress reports provided by the MoneyDolly team were invaluable. In real-time, seeing how each contribution brought us closer to our fundraising goal motivated us to keep pushing forward.
