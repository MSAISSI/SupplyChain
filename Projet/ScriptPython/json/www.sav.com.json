My site is unknown to anyone, so there are suspicions that they took it for themselves in order to then ask for a lot of money to buy back the domain.For what reason are you blocking third parties just now? Why were they even allowed to register earlier and you didn\u2019t notice them before?It turns out that you yourself did not keep track of them, and people who register with third parties do not know that they are violators.As a result, innocent people suffered,Give me back my favorite domain."

          "Titre": "Unexpected Rebilling and Misleading Practices From Sav",
          "Contenu": "Here's my experience with one of the most deceptive domain registrars I've encountered in my years-long career in domaining.In 2021, I placed backorders for domains set to drop that day, and those transactions were fulfilled without any hitches. However, fast-forwarding two years to 2023, some of these domains were dropped as per my decision not to renew them. To my surprise, these domains were re-back-ordered and paid for without my express consent.Upon raising this issue with SAV, their response was effectively shifting the blame onto me, suggesting that I should have manually deleted the backorders.I want to clarify that this wasn't a case of auto-renewal. This was a scenario where I deliberately allowed the domain to lapse, yet SAV chose to rebill me for the backorder.I made it clear to them that I was never informed about the need to manually delete backorders post-execution to prevent them from recurring indefinitely. Furthermore, I emphasized that I never granted them permission to use my payment method for any purpose beyond checkout transactions.Another warning sign I overlooked was the inability to independently remove payment options like PayPal or credit card. The requirement to reach out to their support for this simple action, coupled with their prolonged response time, should have given me pause.Having worked with numerous back-ordering services and registrars over the years, this is the first time I've faced a situation where I was charged for transactions that had been completed two years prior, and without my explicit consent.Stay away."

          "Contenu": "No violations have taken place on either domains as this was only ever forwarding to other websites and then this suddenly stopped without any communication. Unfortunately your response doesn\u2019t solve the situation. Fortunately we have bought other domains for realassets.biz now at reassets.net and abinternational.biz now at abunitedglobal.com. We needed to change all marketing comms at great expense but we have been working with our current domain and web hosting company for over a decade so will continue to do so. Had we received information beforehand from Sav.com and not needed to write to you via support[@]sav.com without a response and then add a TrustPilot to actually get a response. The review will need to stand. As this will need to be the last time we buy any more domains from Sav.com. This will pose as a lesson learnt for your other customers or prevent them from using Sav.com at all. Happy to help...Update reply to an email to Sav:Hi, apparently there has been a violation in respect to spam for abinternational.biz when it has only ever been on a redirect and forwarded to another domain - so remove this ASAP so that serverHOLD can be removed. The same goes for realassets.biz with Sav and this is also on a serverHOLD as shown on ICANN. Remove this ASAP so that the domain can be moved to another registrar who is better equipped to service my business.--------------Original complaint:Perhaps this is the only way to actually get a response. For some reason two domains I have with Sav.com have been put on a ServerHold so this means I cannot transfer the domains out and this also means that the current domain forwarding is not working which I only found out about when clicking on the link. I agree that Sav is horrendous at customer support with no response from submitting a ticket. Please resolve above issue NOW look in your folder for support[at]sav.com about abinternational.biz ServerHold and the same within the submitted ticket."

In recent times, they were also selling domains that they claimed to be under my ownership on sedo.com. Later they again changed the story stating that it looks like my account was hacked. If for a moment I assume that I was owing the domain then how and when did they get a License from me to sell those domains on sedo.com?Their assumption: Sav.com is/are the smartest people on the internet, and the customer the most dumb.In the recent communication their CTO nick wrote: ()\u201cNick (Sav) March 30, 2022 8:24 AM (UTC-05:00)Hello.

          "Contenu": "I have been a domain owner with SAV for several years. Recently, I experienced the loss of two of my domains, .io and .com, due to SAV's failure to send timely reminders about their expiry.The situation unfolded as follows:.io: SAV only sent one reminder before the domain's expiry and provided no further notifications. As a result, I unintentionally lost this domain, despite being willing to renew it promptly had I received adequate reminders..com: Similarly, SAV failed to send any reminders about the upcoming expiry of .com. Consequently, the domain expired and was subsequently auctioned off without giving me a fair opportunity to renew it.In contrast to other reputable registrars like Dynadot and Godaddy, who honor auction cancellation requests from current owners and allow domain renewal, SAV has refused to reinstate the domain in my account. This refusal, despite the registrar's clear lapse in providing essential expiry notifications, leads me to suspect that SAV may be purposefully promoting their auction platform by capitalizing on such situations.I am deeply disappointed and frustrated by this unethical practice by SAV, as it has resulted in the loss of my valuable domains and potentially puts other domain owners at risk of facing similar predicaments. I strongly believe that registrars should uphold their responsibility to ensure transparent and ethical domain management practices.I believe that ICANN's role in overseeing domain registration and management is critical in maintaining the integrity and fairness of the domain industry. By addressing this issue with SAV, ICANN can reinforce trust in the domain registration process and uphold the rights of domain owners."

To my surprise, three days later, I found that my domain name was up for auction on the marketplace for $ 1, a .com domain name. Biggest joke I have ever seen from a domain registrar. Immediately I contacted their customer service to notify them of my refusal to take part in this auction masquerade. And, there I got the most rude answer I have ever had on the net. Frankly their customer service is very rude. I advise you if you value the integrity and the preservation of your domain, never to subscribe to the service of this company. I had 10 domain names with them, I have all transferred. They are just dishonest people"

Sav saw that there was interest in the domain and hiked up the price to maximize profits. They are offering me a refund but this is just clearly dirty business tactics.

How can they explain that?WITH THE AUCTIONS they have clearly lost heir North, affecting my interests with delays, threats and silly excuses, will they block me? At the same time they do not charge me, nor they offered a simple invoice or link to PAY for the auction I am running in circles and no solution so far.

SAV is not even replying to our messages about it. It looks like they stole our domain name. So disappointed, we thought they were a good service. We have hundreds domain names registered with SAV, we will be moving them all to other registrars, if this is not solved ASAP."

Even a chatbot would give better replies than dead air. I have worked in and run customer service departments for over 30 years so I do know it can be done.Liked their price. Ordered my domain name and then approved using PayPal. Went through fast and then PayPal sent me back to Sav.com for completion. That is when the problem started. Nothing but spinning wheel for 2 minutes and then page says that my account is set up but they will send me an email when everything done. I went to bed and this morning I have an email from them saying they had problem with PayPal (no way used that account for years) and domain name purchase could not be completed. I followed all the links including going to PayPal which did not show a problem. Back to Sav.com and now they say the domain name is no longer available."

The host was having a horrible time trying to troubleshoot. I worked with an independent contractor who buys and sells domain names and he even said that what was happening to my account is wrong. That it shouldn't have taken days to take my domain name off the market (IT STILL WAS UP THERE) especially since my card was charged right away and under \"my\" ownership. I emailed once and when they replied with the same cookie-cutter response I lost it. I read all their agreements. The domain name I know is a loss, but this was ridiculous. ONLY a law enforcement number is provided... how does that even work. I guess let's test it out! No domain name is worth having to go through that nightmare.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATED!!! On Oct 22, The CEO Nick Roskam reached out personally to assist me with my difficult situation via email. He was able to solve the issue by lifting the lock on the domain to transfer out.

So while my original experience was terrible, the company went the extra mile to turn it around. Kudos. ORIGINAL REVIEW:I had the worst experience with this company. It took them a full week after purchasing my domain to gain access to the DNS. And then the domain expired without any notice whatsoever from the company that the expiration date was near. There's no phone support, and no weekend support. So nothing could be resolved quickly. Worst domain registrar ever."
