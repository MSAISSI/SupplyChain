I've either 1. been scammed or 2. of all the sites i've been looking through to get this key cheaper are the only one that doesn't properly display if they're out of stock. For that reason alone I wouldn't take the gamble. On top of that, once you bought the product and it gets \"delivered\" the product page that should have the key, just wont and there is literally nothing on the page that shows that anything is going wrong. At a certain point incompetence might as well be malice."

If I go to the supermarket to buy milk, and if I pay for the milk, I expect milk - not being sent out with an empty shopping bag after checkout.PayPal is waiting for their response, which they are apparently not providing. Them pointing to the payment service is ridiculous and, in my eyes, a sign of bad will and dubious business practices."

I can't even see the logic behind it, aside from fishing for as much information as possible with every order. Never ordering here again, and I'm asking Paypal to stop this order as I never recieved my game in the first place."

I got a response from DLGamer, the order appears to be refunded, they say there was a problem with their supplier, they were out of stock but now the item is in stock again. I could try again if I wanted... I did and got the same situation. Payment went through, no key. Now I really feel scammed but I guess is on me now (Fool me once, shame on you.

Sure, your purchase will probably go fine but, if it doesn't they will call you a liar to your face and cause you endless stress.Pros: Item purchased 20% cheaper than anywhere else online.Cons: Extra cumbersome steps added for the appearance of 'security' but, don't actually make anything more secure.  There is a required 2 step verification process you find out about after your purchase but, this number does not have to be in any way tied to you.  They couldn't send a verification text to my personal number and wrongfully claimed it was a VoIP number.  I had to borrow a friends phone to finish the purchase.  A phone number check that will accept a random persons phone number does nothing to add to security and adds quite a bit to difficulty if the system is not functioning properly.UPDATE:  Removed a star because they also apparently can't read complaints.  My PayPal account is verified for one, I double-checked right now and, my phone number is with T-Mobile, not 'Google Voice' and is again, not a VoIP line, it's a cell phone.  If their system is claiming otherwise, then their system is at fault.  As an extra bonus, for the friends phone number I borrowed that they claim was in the same 'region', they live in an entirely different state.  If the 'region' is that broad, then using it as a security check is again pointless.  The only thing it adds is extra difficulty to legitimate customers.UPDATE2:  Can't remove any more stars, would recommend anyone else purchasing anything to just pay the extra cost that comes with shopping somewhere legitimate that cares about customer service.  Was called a liar repeatedly via email and received threats and ultimatums asking me to remove my review.  Have just been informed that they are cancelling my order.  Oh, they also reported my review for 'Inappropriate Language' in an attempt to censor it."

Just take some time and read the other negative reviews on this site- it's easy to filter them. You will notice several instances where this company threatens users with order cancellations for posting negative reviews, and a review by Terra in 2016 who said, \"They really .. they used my order name instead of my review name when answering. I am .. well, now I'm really worried they have my phone number.\" Also, make note that there are many 3 and 4-star reviews that state they did not appreciate having their phone number extracted (and probably should have given fewer stars). The bottom line, this company needs to require verification BEFORE order completion (not just show a notice, which failed to appear in my case). This has been a frequent request and complaint since they implemented the system in 2014. I have also updated the title of my review to make it more transparently accurate.Edit 3: Please- keep it coming! Everyone knows the true measure of a company is seen in how they respond to criticism. I have at this point literally read hundreds of 1 and 2-star negative reviews, and dozens more that should have been lower scores but people gave you the benefit of a doubt. The fact that you continue to propagate this \"discussion\" as an attempt to show I am in the wrong, further serves to illuminate my position. You looked up my IP address on a map, and compared that to the zip I provided- that's a first bad sign as to what is being done with my data. This is why I typically only use VPNs because I can't trust that random websites like yours will actually safeguard my information. For that matter, I read a review where you used another lady's private full name in your response to her review! No, I don't want to provide your site ANY personal information. If I'm providing personal information at all, it is to a PAYMENT PROCESSOR- you require that I fill out my private information into YOUR SITE! Not only can that be illegal, by violating PCI requirements, it is completely disingenuous for you to then turn around and use what little personal information you harvested off me against me. On that note, in response to people's continued questioning about your need for their phone numbers, you've copy/pasted a clause from the EU mandate on online inter-commerce, which clearly states that an IP address alone can be used as validation for an order.  Lastly, thought experiment- if my bank didn't go through with the payment, and I wasn't charged, then why did you need to issue a refund....? Edit 2: So everyone can see how ridiculous this exchange has become- just take a brief look through the rest of the comments and see others' reviews (even ones that are positive). This company will require all of your personal information, including your phone number, *after* you create an account and *after* you complete a purchase with them. You can believe what they say... or believe the thousands of other people who say otherwise. Either way consumer, it's your choice whether or not to purchase from this company.Edit: I do not share personal information with any of the sites I use to purchase game keys from- I have never had a problem with any of them. I understand collecting the minimum information to complete a purchase, but that is not what your site did. You completed a purchase from a consumer and then requested more information than is even generally necessary to verify the information. After begrudgingly sharing any of this information, your site then locked this purchase and asked for even more information. If you need information- please ask for it upfront.  This company charged me and THEN asked me for a bunch of additional information to \"verify me\" (You already took my money honey, the amount is literally showing as processed on my card). If you're going to ask for information to \"verify someone\" do it BEFORE you take their money- now I have to deal with this through my bank. Save your time and money and go to another site that's actually verified- stay away from this place."

I'm sure they don't share the number or anything but ever since I purchased a game from their site, and gave them my phone number, I suddenly started having a scam claiming to be Verizon Wireless calling me. Also not a fan of their return policy as it's quite confusing. When I bought Monster Hunter Worlds, it stated on where It gave me the key that it has a no questions asked 14 day return policy if there's less than 2 hours played. But also says on their website's return policy if you redeem the key or download the game, you immediately give up your right for a return. Luckily, I liked the game so I didn't have to worry about this too much but.. Just be wary.Edit: lowered score. By a star. Between the many, many spelling errors when responding back to a bad review, and instantly sending another email saying \u201cWe permit ourselves to contact since there is a change[sic] for you to not receive our answer on your trustpilot comment.\u201dHonestly shows me even more they aren\u2019t very trustworthy since their support can\u2019t even spellcheck before entitling themselves to sending an email."

I placed my order on the 19th January, 2016 and chose the bank transfer payment method. Then I transferred the money to the adress provided, which was so messily written I had doubts I sent it to the proper account. \r At that point my order showing that all I needed to do to get the game was to transfer the money. I was thinking maybe the bank is waiting to do the actual transfer until the next day because I ordered sort of late in the day. Indeed, the transfer landed the next day, my bank told me. But no game code was seen on the website. I proceeded to contact their staff to clear this up. A day passed, no answer. The next day, I wrote again. No answer. \r Infuriated, I started looking for alternative ways of contacting the staff of the site and found the support email adress and wrote there. I got a reply from them several hours later, in the middle of the night. They told me that I had not emailed them previously and that's when I realised the contact form on the website must have been broken. \r After this, a lenghty exchange in broken English ensued. I was made to jump through seemingly infinite amount of hoops before the game code was actually released to me.\r I cannot recommend using their service to anyone at this point. If you are able, shop elsewhere."

Consider finding alternative ways to do this step.\r- They should inform clearly and explicitly that there can be an (up to 10 minute?) delay before the goods are delivered. Again, before payment step.\r These things should in no way come as a surprise to the customer after s/he has paid. In addition, storing that information opens up possible liability and trust problems for the store, as this is valuable data on the black market.\r And btw, that amazon does something doesn't necessarily convey credibility. \r The rating stands. But if the site does update it's process to be more transparent and predictable further reviews might not be so negative.\r Edit2: They really .. they used my order name instead of my review name when answering. I am .. well, now I'm really worried they have my phone number.\r Edit3: And just noticed the amazon link is for 2step verification.. for your account. That is an optional extra security for logging into your account...

          "Contenu": "Getting an account setup and getting a singular purchase made took infinitely more time than I felt that it should have. What should've been a two-step purchasing process turned into a ten-step flip between emails, other tabs, and this store and overall just ended up being a woefully long experience just to buy a single thing. I will be avoiding buying from here ever again if I can help it, just to avoid having to go through 5 levels of confirmation notices just to complete a singular order.Edit on 5/21/17: Apparently I cannot reply to store responses. Odd that the review site doesn't let me communicate with the store effectively. While the explanation of compliance with EU laws (which don't affect me personally as I am US based) is a valid reason for the additional security measures (owed to the EU's extensive consumer protection legislation), I still find that the entire process was overly arduous compared to competitors in your field. I have time-stamps from the emails I received from your company showing that the process of getting simply email-related confirmations out of the way took no less than 6 minutes; the total process, of course, took more time than that as I had to actually interact with your site after the several confirmations of confirmations had been processed through 3 emails and a text before I was allowed to *actually* proceed to checkout. The total time it took for my order to be completed by you from the time I clicked to checkout to the time that my key was accepted by Steam was at least a magnitude of 3 times or more than any other competitor of yours that I've done business with, even considering that this was a first-time, new account sale. If the standard checkout time is even half of what the first-time checkout process was, it would still be twice as fast to use any other storefront.I will not be changing my review score at this time because I honestly do believe that the over-verification hurt the user experience and ease of checkout when compared to other web-based key sellers. While I may give the store one additional chance in the future to see if things have been streamlined, I do not plan to willingly return to this storefront again unless some miraculous sale is taking place here. Coming here to purchase games currently on discount (when competitors are not) is simply not worth the red tape. I would rather spend the extra money elsewhere for the ease of use."

The infinite looping arrows at the \"Preorder\" step is a bit confusing, I wasn't sure to either stare for something to happen or to leave the page. I'd really suggest removing that and just say \"Your game has been preordered, to download the game you will have to wait until date.\", the date you show already with a countdown.Experience:Smooth sailing ordering process.Download:The game I preordered was Monster Hunter World and it was releasing the keys early from another game site for other people, I had to ask DLGamer to provide the key as well. They were super quick to address the situation (within 30mins-1hour) and provided me with a key. Super great service!!Overall, I totally recommend!"
