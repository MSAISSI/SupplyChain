          "Contenu": "The most expensive headset I've bought, but also the worst. Fortunately, thanks to the warranty, this is the fourth headset I've received because I have to contact support every 4 to 6 months for, and you better laugh at this, four different major issues. The software shows a battery pop-up at 10%, but the headset shuts down in less than 10 seconds. The keyboard types double letters, of course, shortly after the warranty expires. The only things I have no complaints about are the mouse and the mousepad! Obviously, I do not recommend it, and I won't be choosing ROCCAT for my next setup. On the other hand, the customer support is responsive and efficient."

Again, a year in, this time the middle mouse button gave out.

I don't have any backup mice, so I would have to go buy a replacement to wait for my replacement. Completely absurd."

So I had to contact support each day thru their support forms before I could even receive a response. When their basic suggested fixes, over just a couple emails, didn't work, they just stopped responding all together. Bumped them a few times with nothing in response. Over priced junk without support. I was able to return 1 of the keyboards, but stuck with a overpriced, broken, useless Roccat keyboard. Also noticed a Roccat mouse I had for a couple years started to not recognize a click. I would have to right click & open files in the menu, but never complained because I don't like dealing with the amount of time it takes with support normally. Went to Alienware & purchased a keyboard & mouse with more suitable functions for cheaper than Roccat's overpriced keyboard."

I bought from their website directly the roccat kone pure ultra around the end of November 2019. Used the mouse for a bit but it had a few issues such as loose buttons, creaky shell, rattly sensor and croaky scrollwheel. I've emailed their customer service to request a refund because then though their website says I can request a refund through my profile on their site, clicking on some shait but it wasn't there. I get an email from someone who's apparently a manager and which wrote I'd be emailed, within \"a few hours\" two emails, one with shipping label and instructions and another email with some other shait. Next day still no email. OK, i thought it was delayed as it was around December 11 at the time, maybe they're busy with preparing for Christmas. Another week no reply. Now it's about a month since I requested and inquired further through emails about the refund and still nothing. Only the occasional automated reply about them 'receiving my email'. To end this review, I'd say that you should stay away from buying from them directly. Buy from amazon or another site. These guys give 0 Fs about you, and the customer service shows. I doubt I'll be getting my refund, but I have still some little hope. If not they can choke on that \u00a360 I paid for the mouse."

          "Contenu": "I've been using Roccat products since 2012, including mouse mats, mice and headsets. My First higher-end gaming mouse was a Roccat Savu, which after almost 10 years I replaced with a Roccat Kone AIMO Remastered.I didn't even look online for reviews of this mouse, because I trusted the brand based on my previous experiences. I would very soon find out that this was a terrible mistake, however.Only a few days after having the mouse, I noticed that the scroll wheel would sometimes input a scroll in the opposite direction. At first I thought this was somehow related to it being new, since the issue seemed to become less frequent after using the scroll wheel for a few minutes.However, the issue only became worse, yet I unfortunately neglected to contact Roccat within the warranty period, which in hindsight only shows how disilusioned I was. Now that the warranty is over, the problem is unbearable: for every 9-11 scrolls in one direction, it does an input in the opposite direction. I finally searched online for help and found out that this is a recurrent issue since the launch of the first Kone mice from Roccat, and apparently also common in their other models.I contacted Roccat for help, hoping that they would repair it for a fee, or provide guidance to help me repair it myself. Their answer was that they don't do repairs, that they won't provide any guidance, and that I should buy a new mouse from their store. They gave me a 15% discount code (even though I made it clear I don't want to buy a new mouse), which, even if I used to buy the same mouse I have, it would actually still be almost twice the price I paid for it when I got it 2.5 years ago, since the Roccat official store has a ridiculous markup for some reason.I did some research and it seems the new Logitech G502 X is a great alternative to the Roccat Kone AIMO Remastered, and no one complains about any recurrent issues on the G502 the way they do about Roccat's mice. It's a similar shape and weight to the Kone AIMO Remastered, has all of the cool features (such as an \"easy-shift\" equivalent) and is almost half the price. The more I look into it, the more I realise how disillusioned I was about Roccat. In fact, if you read the 5-star reviews on Trustpilot, you'll see that most compliment the customer support for providing replacements for faulty parts, including several mentioning that they've had to replace products more than once in a row! That's a major red flag that I should have seen.I've never been one to grow attached to brands, but after almost 10 years using durable, high-quality Roccat products, I considered myself loyal to Roccat. It's such a huge disappointment to see that the brand no longer seems to hold any of the high standards that got me to fall in love with them in the first place.With all this, as much as it saddens me, I know I won't be buying from Roccat ever again."

I took care of the products and if look on Roccat reddit it is filled with people complaining about the quality of the products, whether its software or hardware problems. I would recommed people check out the classic firms like corsair and Razor for mices and generally Razor and Steelseries for keyboards. Dont get pulled in by the looks of the products, they are utterly disappointing.Roccat support if you read this please contact me, if you want to remedy the situation."

Roccat claim they've told the delivery company the correct address yet nothing. Roccat then said said the item will be sent back to their warehouse at which point shipped out to me correctly.

They responded within about 24hrs and gave me a list of troubleshooting directives to try.  They didn\u2019t work.  I replied to their email and haven\u2019t heard back in 4 days.  They only respond by email and there isn\u2019t a customer service number to reach out to.  It\u2019s under warranty which by the way is very vague and unhelpful.  So now I have a broken mouse, no customer support and I\u2019m underwhelmed by their support.  Treat your customers right.  I\u2019m buying a new mouse and it won\u2019t be from this company.  Update-  they responded and here is what they said; Your product will need to be replaced under warranty.In this case, you do not need to ship your original product to us. To proceed with warranty replacement service:1) Unplug your Roccat product from any computer, controller, game console, phone, and power source.2) Take a picture of the products serial number. You can find the serial number either on the original packaging or on the sticker on the bottom of your device.3) Take a picture of the ENTIRE product in its current condition.  In the same photo, show your RMA number HANDWRITTEN (not printed or digitally modified in any way) clearly on a sheet of paper next to the product. 4) AFTER you have taken that picture, CUT the cable of your product using scissors, carefully.5) AFTER cutting the cable, take a photo that shows the entire product, including the cut cable. In the same photo, show your RMA number HANDWRITTEN (not printed or digitally modified in any way) clearly on a sheet of paper next to the product. 6) Reply to this email with ALL THREE images that were requested aboveThis is just awful.  I\u2019m out a mouse for 14 days."

The steps that they asked me to do was something I've never heard of in any form of warranty claim before, and frankly, quite strange behavior.Stated in the email was the terms; The product you receive will be delivered in up to two weeks (Not horrendous, but not good either)Then stated; The product you receive may be a second hand or refurbished product. We cannot guarantee either. (I thought, great! what a way to get rid of all their returns, hand them out to warranty customers! charming!)It goes on; Take a photo of you CUTTING the cord on the keyboard, to prove you have destroyed it...WHAT?! so they have already said they don't take back products, so they aren't gaining ANYTHING from this, but they still want to sting the customer by making sure the product is destroyed??? what am I supposed to use while I wait for this, possibly, nearly destroyed also, second hand keyboard? are they telling me I have to go out to purchase another temporary board to use while I wait, for not even another new board, to arrive?! This is insane. No wonder they have an awful track record on here! Warranty under almost 99% of any company will replace the broken product with a NEW one. They also dont care what you do with the old one, either that or they want it sent back to them!If ROCCAT are really serious about the customer destroying the product, why not just send it back and they do it themselves to prevent all this hassle???Really dodgy and weird business practices here. This is the first, and last time I will ever buy a roccat product, and i'll advise my friends to do the same"

Even though I've told Roccat twice that action X is possible with the mouse, she/it keeps on parroting that it's not possible. I could send over a video showing what happens, but then she/it will just say I've edited the video ... or more likely simply ignore what I'm saying and repeat the same old nonsense. Just to rub salt into the wound, at some point they scrap the conversation history in the email reply. I guess this is to make it harder for you to point out \"Look. I already told you this twice! Just see below!\" Honestly, words fail me, with behavior like this.It's pointless. I've been here before with other companies and I know that now is the time to give up, try forget about the time you wasted on them, and just adapt to what you've got. You definitely won't get any help from them.Oh, and Roccat, if you're reading this, please don't tell me to respond to the last email about this.

You've lost 3 sales opportunities. In addition, I will never purchase another product from you.

          "Contenu": "While I cannot complain about the professionalism and Roccat's adherence to their own policies during the warranty exchange, I have to say it is wasteful and inferior to Logitech's options.Roccat makes you destroy your own product by cutting the cable, with photo proof, even if a small aspect like the mouse's scroll wheel is not functioning properly. This is very wasteful, as such products could still be given away or used by someone who cannot afford them.Logitech lets you keep the original products, and also ships you a new product."

I love the aesthetics and design of the Vulcan so I would have purchased another one anyway as it is truly a beautiful and efficient keyboard. I\u2019ve used other expensive, brand name input devices that have also developed \u201csticky keys\u201d so this can and does happen. The difference is that Roccat really stood by their product when they didn\u2019t have to. Now that\u2019s great service. They already had my future business, now they have my respect.Thanks once again.."

However, Roccat was quick to help me with all of my issues.My only issue is that the company does not have spare parts for keyboards. My keyboard replacement's space bar was unevenly made, and my old key for the space bar would not fit on it, so I asked for a replacement of that key. However, Roccat does not provide individual keys, so I had to do the same thing that I had done before and get a whole new keyboard. Hopefully in the future, they create individual keys that support can send to people or offer replacement keys online."

It's true that the keyboard was under warranty, but still, I wouldn't be surprised if they told me \"your fault\" but I would still be glad to pay for the keycap - better than buying a new keyboard.Genuinely pleased with Roccat.
