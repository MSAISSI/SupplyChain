          "Contenu": "It's not a lifetime license. They are scammers and manipulating people by saying as lifetime license. I have told my detailed experience below. So only buy the software if you are millionaire man and don't care about your money anymore. This is not a home made story I have all email conversations as a proof which I can provide to anyone in future if needed.bought the personal license for lifetime for 3 computers before few time.At first it was giving very slow speed and I complained for that as well and they said they are working on it but nothing changed ever.But the main part comes then. My computer got upgrade from windows 10 pro to windows 11 pro. And the program logged out automatically. I entered the activation keys again but due to some reason that didn't worked so I created a new user on my computer and tried there. And somehow I could login to account.After sometime the software got logged out again automatically and my key didn't worked by giving error that you are already using this license on 3 pc already. I contacted customer support and explained all in details. One lady named Olivia responded me very rudely saying that she don't care about what happened but the only thing she was  oncerned was that I entered key 3 times. I asked her to confirm on her end that there is not a single license running under the activation key she provided and I had to enter key 3 times on my same system because of their faulty software which was full of errors and I couldn't use the license properly in past as well because of that error. And she straight away declined my valid reason and sent me link to buy their license again. That's a big shame one them...Really they do only care is about money and once you buy their software you will be surely helpless because of their faulty software.Honestly saying i had very bad experience with them so I warn each and every one about it and please do think 1000 times before you buy a single penny thing from them..."

I bought 2 licenses for 4k downloader hoping that these issues will eventually get resolved but it is clear that the 4k downloader internal team does not use their products because if they did, they will understand that it has alot of bugs and as a result fix them."

You \"fixing\" the issue is me having to take huge amount of screenshots, then do a 5 step process that takes 15 minutes. If it happens once, it's okay.

Ich habe aber keine Kreditkarte und auch kein Online-Banking. Die einzige M\u00f6glichkeit f\u00fcr mich, f\u00fcr die Software zu zahlen, w\u00e4re Prepayment (Vorrauszahlung) Als ich das dem Support mitteilte, wurde nicht darauf reagiert. Statt dessen erhielt ich den Bescheid, ich k\u00f6nne ja auch die kostenlose Version nutzen, was ich auch tue. F\u00fcr mich ist das ein seltsamer Laden, der nicht imstande ist, seine Bankdaten her\u00fcberzureichen und das wahrscheinlich auch gar nicht will. Also verdient die Firma kein Geld an mir und es scheint ihnen v\u00f6llig egal zu sein. \u00dcber die Software kann ich mich nicht beschweren. Sie ist gut. Aber was die Bezahlung angeht, ist das eine r\u00fcckst\u00e4ndige Firma, die einem die Bezahlmethoden aufs Auge dr\u00fcckt. So komme ich nicht umhin, nur einen Stern zu vergeben.Edit: All my relatives are dead and my friends are few. I wouldn't know who to ask. I bought the Macrium Reflect software for \u20ac 66 and it was no problem to pay by prepayment. Why is that not possible with you? I also bought the Pro version of the PrivaZer program for \u20ac 30 and here too there were no problems with prepayment. Only you don't have that and that's an indictment. I understand that adding a new payment method is a bit complicated, so you should get on with it as soon as possible and put it into practice. You must have a bank account. And spare me your annoying advertising (Black Friday, for example) I can only see that you don't want to do business and you're leaving me out in the cold. That can't be right. Goodbye.PPS: I gave you an answer and I don\u00b4t have to say anything more about it. One star is enough for you."

Due to their technical limitations they cannot reassign the license to your new device.Edit: My response to their response: it's also misleading to say you can activate the license on up to 3 computers, it can just be one computer, but the second you modify or change that machine 3 times, that key is wasted and cannot be recovered. Typically software licenses are detached from a device on request if that machine changes over time or if the machine is broken and no longer accessible. So buying this license entitles you to 3 total activations, not necessarilly concurrently, but in total."

This is intentionally misleading, with the goal of having users fail to notice the difference until after the new program is installed.Either change the name of the new program to avoid confusion or have the update link in the old program go to the update for the old program.

Since the free version, which I used previously, worked perfectly on both computers. (In the same ones that are now in use in the paid version). I thought that there was some misconfiguration in the computers and I did the formatting process, but without success in correcting the problem in the downloads. After uninstalling and reinstalling the 4k software, it no longer activates on the computer. I contacted 4k support and was disappointed with the service when they told me that there are more than 3 activations on 2 SINGLE devices and because of this it can no longer be activated. When I completed the purchase of the product, I received an email with the confirmation of the purchase saying: You have successfully unlocked all features of 4k Video Download. LIFETIME LICENSE. license key number LASTS FOR LIFE AND CAN BE ACTIVATED ON UP TO 3 different devices.

          "Contenu": "Do not buy from this company. Their 4K Tokkit Lite product is not just bad quality. Their CRM is horrendous and drags you into endless conversations creating obstacles to a USD 11 reimbursement, when they can actually check that the product has been uninstalled and used for just a few minutes with VERY POOR RESULTS. Terrible Watermark removal. It does not do the trick. A big disappointment.Buying a product, installing it, trying it takes commitment and time. Immediately that you made a mistake brings disappointment and frustration. Engaging with CRM asking for a simple refund that leads to a long chain of e-mails in which they ask you for a chance to solve your issue and threaten you not to be reimbursed is simply UNACCEPTABLE.IT IS THE RIGHT of any consumer to retract based on one's own judgement. The consumer should not be forced or threatened to engage in additional time consuming exchanges questioning his competence or  reimbursement request. If a consumer judges a product is POOR QUALITY, this is the consumer's right and opinion, and the consumer should given credit, instead of being taken on a ride cannibalising more of his time.The consumer should not be WRONGLY and FALLACIOUSLY  led to believe that the policy of the company the product was bought from is BEYOND COMMON LAW and COMPELS HIM to engage in additional exchanges and justifications for a reimbursement to occur.I wasted my money, I wasted my time, I was taken on a ride for USD 11. This company is a perfect example of manipulation and deceit. It happens every day to a lot of people, and this is why Trustpilot exist.And what can I expect from them now?You've got it: WASTING MORE OF MY TIME writing this, sharing screen, justifying myself, etc.Will I be compensated for my contribution? Of course not, at best, if I am lucky, I will get my money back. BACK TO ZERO, this is what you win buying from the wrong people. Buy only from companies that have a \"MONEY BACK GUARANTEED. NO QUESTIONS ASKED\" business ethics.If you don't DO THIS or THAT or THIS, we cannot reimburse you. No, of course, that's not a threat, that's just a \"CONDITION\". I do NOTHING MORE FOR YOU unless you pay me. Is that clear?"

          "Titre": "Man I wish these programs worked better",
          "Contenu": "All the programs in the bundle (except for 4K YouTube to mp3) have scrambled text/corrupted looking to where I literally can\u2019t read it. *edit* Sometimes it can be read and sometimes can\u2019t, usually exploring the GUI menus makes it scrambled again. I changed the language from system to English, updated my computer like instructed. Still happens and support basically told me to get a newer computer (on OSX Big Sur, I can\u2019t update because of compatibility issues moving forward but they should be able to have an alternative GUI where the text is at least legible, I\u2019ve had other programs do just that). Seems like a fault of the programming to me, but at the end of the day all I know is I can\u2019t read anything (which includes error messages to trouble shoot when contacting support).Edit* I originally thought Tokkit stopped downloading at the 715th video but it saves the \u2018likes\u2019 rather than the \u2018saves\u2019 which was my mistake. I added a star back to my review because I saw an issue that wasn\u2019t an issue.I was able to download all the Instagram videos I was trying to however\u2014 you can\u2019t save the specific collections so it\u2019s kind of a mess. I also can\u2019t search the uploads by uploader which would help me reverse engineer my groups by hand\u2014 I can search the caption text under it but not all posts will have that. I value the software  enough to keep the program and I hope they are able to or willing to find solutions for the things I mentioned but not necessarily feeling happy with my purchase.Edit*1. You should be able to find my messages with support, it was only a day or two ago.2. The fact that Big Sur (a relatively recent OSX version) isn\u2019t supported\u2014 and the answer to that ISN\u2019T to find a way to support it in the GUI like most software does, but instead for me to have an additional computer with an OSX that is newer than Big Sur is really silly (Big Sur literally came out only 3 years ago). Also it assumes I have two computers.3. I\u2019m aware collections aren\u2019t a feature\u2014 I was saying they should be considered (although I don\u2019t know how possible that is) but without it the downloads folder currently is just a mess without some form of organization. I suggested an alternative that should be fairly easy is to include the Instagram user in the downloaded video metadata or title itself.Edit 2*1. Updating their OS \u2026\u201dhelped\u201d them\u2026 while potentially risking incompatibility with every other program on their system just so they could \u2026read some text? Do you see the issue with that solution?2. I overlooked this before but the \u2018saved collections\u2019 feature \u2026while isn\u2019t explicitly stated\u2026 it IS heavily implied that the program can save collections. Please consider the impression this page gives. It reads\u2026\u201cDownload Instagram Saved Posts and Saved Collections on Desktop in Bulk\u201dAnd goes on to give steps to do that with 4K Stogram but leaves it very easy to confuse the reader into thinking they can download specific collections in bulk.4kdownload (dot) com/blog/2022/10/31/download-saved-posts-from-instagram--1/Edit 3*It\u2019s up to me to update my OS which is rather recent for a solution that may help\u2026 that\u2019s silly. I have made the points I think worth making, I\u2019ll change my rating if future updates answer these issues in some significant way."

          "Contenu": "My recent experience with 4K Download (4kdownload.com) left me thoroughly disappointed and frustrated. This platform, which claims to provide efficient and high-quality downloads, failed to live up to even the most basic expectations, making it difficult for me to recommend it to anyone.First and foremost, the user interface of 4K Download was far from user-friendly. Navigating the website was a cumbersome task, with cluttered menus and confusing options. It was a struggle to find the desired features or understand how to utilize them effectively. The lack of intuitive design only added to the frustration of using the platform.Furthermore, the performance of 4K Download was incredibly unreliable. Despite promises of fast and efficient downloads, I encountered numerous issues throughout my usage. The software frequently crashed, froze, or experienced inexplicable errors, disrupting the download process and wasting my time. These technical glitches made it difficult to complete even the simplest tasks, undermining the very purpose of the platform.The customer support provided by 4K Download was equally disappointing. When I encountered problems and reached out for assistance, the response was slow and unhelpful. The support team seemed indifferent to my concerns and provided generic, automated replies that did little to address my specific issues. It was evident that customer satisfaction was not a priority for them.Moreover, the free version of 4K Download was severely limited in its capabilities. While the platform advertises itself as a free tool, it fails to mention that many essential features are locked behind a paywall. This lack of transparency is deceptive and misleading, leaving users feeling cheated and frustrated. The pricing structure for the premium version also seemed excessive, especially considering the subpar performance and lack of reliable customer support.In terms of security, 4K Download raised serious concerns. Given the nature of downloading files from various sources, I expected robust measures to protect my computer from malware or malicious content. Unfortunately, the platform provided little assurance in this regard, leaving me unsure about the safety of the files I downloaded.Overall, my experience with 4K Download was a complete letdown. The confusing user interface, unreliable performance, unhelpful customer support, limited free version, and questionable security practices all contribute to my negative review. I strongly urge others to explore alternative options for downloading software, videos, and other content, as 4K Download fails to deliver on its promises of efficiency and quality."

First of all, it is not written clearly in the product info page (it just says high quality audio download), second of all in the apps preferences, there is an option to download at 320kbps quality. If YouTube does not support it, then why do they have that option in the app? That is clearly deceiving the customer."

In my ticket to them I clearly stated that I am using the latest version including the version number, which exactly matches the latest version on their website.Apparently their support team isn't paying attention to such details and one can expect just a random standard response when asking for help.

So its one big jumbled mess of files in a folder. If its a big channel with lots of videos you can imagine the chaos of the files in the folder being completely random. If you want to watch the files in order its impossible...making the download channel option almost useless.You end up with a bunch videos in a folder with no way of knowing the order they were publishedPlus if you want to come back later to download more videos from that channel, its a pain to see where you left off.This fix is so easy...put YouTube publication dates on the files...or number the files...#1(video file name)...#2(video file name)...#3(video file name)....ectas it is the channel download feature is too much of a pain to useIve used other software of this type and they all had creation dates on the files or they numbered the files, so this request is not some crazy ask...its a basic standard on other softwareOther then that the software works fine and is great for single video downloadsIf they will correct this, ill post a glowing 5 star review"

I was able to download my thousands (literally) of saved songs  all in mp3 format. Also backed up all of my channel videos with more ease than the Youtube studio itself. Only thing that didn't work quite well for downloading .mp3 files is that it tends to automatically attatch an artist to a song you downloaded, sometimes it's an incorrect artist. For instance there is a song named \"A Word in Your Ear\" by musician \"John Shakespeare\", but the software labeled the mp3 file with an artist named \"Alfie\" instead (which just happens to be another artist that produced a song with the same name). But that's about all I can complain about it. If this software could search for songs that have been uploaded to official music channels (Usually with the label \"Topic\" next to it), it could use that to identify the correct musician instead. But if it can't find an artist, maybe it'd be best for it to not automatically attatch an artist."

In other words, you can get the same experience with other downloaders that are free, if you are planning to watch them on small devices. If you plan on watching on a laptop or desktop, it would be worth if you are having network outages or rely on hotspots to download.5/10 for looks7/10 for compatibility6/10 for reliability, download speeds4/5 overall.

          "Contenu": "I am rating this 4 out of 5 stars because having to reinstall this with paid can be a pain sometimes. Its not an AVS kind of pain where they totally try to screw you, but its annoying sometimes.I use this for many sites not just YouTube. Its nice because I can convert videos into sound or video formats to play on my computer saving time & bandwidth.I think I got more then one software when I bought this from them but this is the only one that I use. This is one of those programs you can use one up to 2 computers which is a great deal being I have just that amount, but I reformat every 30-90 days to get that new computer feel as you can not really get all the crud off your computer otherwise. In any cause they have been nice enough to rearm my key each time & not really given me any problems, but like I say you have to wait to get it rearmed & sometimes that can take a bit.As for should you use the free version or the paid one, that is really up to you. I think I could have gotten by with the free version since I do not download full YouTube channels or multiple videos at once from a album or whatever. I bought it because I liked it not because I wanted the extra content or options.I recommend it though."

          "Contenu": "Thoughts after 1,100 downloadsThe new 4k video downloader is outstanding. I used it for free for a very long time and have since bought the professional license (as I do with several paid programs.) The developers are very lenient with the free version, as you can use it forever and the requests to buy a license aren't too invasive. I personally found the license worth it, as it's not a subscription, and it's not that expensive either. The program is also constantly updated which is a very nice thing to have. You also have the option to download as an mp3 file or a couple other audio files.The program does exactly what I want it to do. The only thing I would want to be added is for the video files to be marked with the date they were downloaded (similar to how when you take a photo with a camera, the file has the \"date modified\" marker on it, which is helpful for sorting what is most recently downloaded while using the file explorer instead of the actual app itself.) I also wish there was the ability to turn off the popup when the program is updated, because every time you update the app, your browser will open and take you to the 4k downloader website saying \"Thank you for downloading\" regardless of whether you have the license or not, and there's no way to turn it off. Occasionally the program will sometimes switch the download file format to mkv or m4a, which I wish was changed (or a setting to change the defaults) because those two file formats are unusable for me, for various reasons."

Therefore I am updating the review.------------------------------Original review:I have just purchased their bundle which gives me access to all their product with the pro license.The transaction went smoothly and I immediately got the licenses.I downloaded 4k Video Download and the license did not work. It says \"Can't activate ...  please enter the correct key\".Did I copy-paste the wrong key (I received 5)? no, it was the correct key.I sent an email to their support.I then decided to try another of their app. After all, I paid for a bundle.I installed 4K Video to mp3.  There is nowhere to activate the product or check the subscription...I am starting to wonder.They claim I can request a refund within 14 days of purchase. Let's wait and see for a few days for their support to respond.Hopefully, I will not have to ask for a refund and won't have to write another review saying they never refunded me.Fingers crossed."

I\u2019m a newbie woodworker and like to d/l YouTube videos that teach me about my new hobby. I often watch the same video several times in a row to drill the information into my brain. 4K Downloader makes downloading and saving videos a snap.But I had lost the license number and that meant contact with the dreaded \u201cCustomer Service.\u201d It seems to me that \u201cservice\u201d to the \u201ccustomer\u201d has become less and less service and more and more a rebuke to the customer.Customer Service at 4K Downloader blew me out of the water. Not only was the response prompt, it was also polite, appreciative of my usage of the product, provided the information that I needed, and urged me to contact again if there were any difficulties with setting the app in place.My experience is that if I really want a certain item, I\u2019ll buy it whether or not the salesperson is helpful. But, if the service personnel are not helpful when needed, I never return to that store. Good customer service keeps a customer happy. Excellent customer service, such as I received from 4K Downloader, makes a customer a life-time customer.Who can ask for more than a great product and excellent customer service."
