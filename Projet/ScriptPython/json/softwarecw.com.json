SoftwareCW had a great purchase price, so I purchased and downloaded it on my new computer ASAP. It did not work properly from the word go. I reinstalled it and continued to have the same problems. I reached out to SoftwareCW to ask for support and got no reply. There isn't even an option for a refund but you have open the download. You will never have any idea whether the software works until you open the download, so if it doesn't work, you're screwed, just like I was for $452.60 I will never see again."

It's ONLY compatible with Windows 7 and 8.  Other companies have that in the body of the description or, better yet, in the NAME of the title \"Paintbrush Pro x9 for Windows 7 and 8 ONLY.  I spent FIVE hours trying to find help.  I finally found Corel's number and have started getting help.  She told me how to find the download that came with the link.  There's NO instructions in the email.  It was in a tiny box in the upper right corner of my search page.  It didn't work.  Again, my problem for not reading the \"key \" page that is mentioned in the link.  Go directly to the seller.  Any company that doesn't highlight their warnings isn't a company I want to do business with.  I have actually had POP UP PAGES that said\"  Are you sure your computer is compatible with this (old) software?  That type of warning  is too hard to miss.  I am also uncomfortable with their refund policy.  I really don't understand it.  To me, it's ambiguous and leans very heavily in their favor.  I know they may have people who take advantage when they have no problem, but an honest mistake should qualify for a refund.  It appears the onus is on the buyer."

At the conclusion of numerous failed attempts to complete a simple order I got a message from Google saying they were interested in feedback regarding my purchase with Software CW.  However it's taken over two weeks for Google to give me this opportunity, and I no longer recall the specifics regarding at least 8 failed attempts to make a simple one item purchase. I was required to completely re-enter all or most of the order and personal info after every failed attempt with no indication from the system as to which items it found objectionable. Based on my experience, the Software CW order application is completely broken. I emphatically recommend that Google do not  endorse Software CW until they fix their unacceptably buggy and completely user unfriendly online order system."

          "Contenu": "I recently ordered Smith Micro Clip Studio Paint EX from SoftwareCW through one of several retail marketplaces they use as auxiliary vendors for their merchandise. I did not know them as a company but knew the reputation of these marketplaces to be sound so I took a chance. The program was listed at a fantastic price, and there was a countdown for how long the deal would last. I ordered it. I even signed up for the free purchase protection from Google because this was a Google Trusted Store. That is the level of faith I thought I could have in them.This purchase was a Christmas present for my partner. It's not SoftwareCW's fault that we're struggling students, I get that. But I bought a product at the advertised price from a company.I received Clip Studio Paint Pro. The Pro version lacks several key features of EX. I figured it was a mistake in shipping, every order confirmation I received indicated that I had purchased EX. In my package there was a paper slip directing me to address any issues with my order by contacting the SoftwareCW support team. I emailed them requesting a return label and the product I purchased. Credit where credit is due, the response time was excellent. The response, however, left a bad taste in my mouth.\"SoftwareCW Customer Support (SoftwareCW Customer Support)Dec 29, 11:56 AM CSTHi, please find attached a return label for you to use to return the software. You will be refunded in full once the item is received. I am very sorry for the inconvenience, the [marketplace] product page is mislisted and should have said Pro, not EX.If you have any other questions, please let me know!Regards,SoftwareCW Customer Support\"The problem I have here is that this was the advertised price. This was the price listed for the marketplace I shopped through and it was initially provided as a link it through Google's shop feature. I honestly believed I could have faith in this purchase. This was their listing error.  I don't want a refund, I want the product I ordered. I worked extra shifts to have Christmas money and I could afford the price I paid. I might even have been able to afford more, before I finished allocating Christmas money, but having made a purchase in good faith from a seemingly reputable company I didn't save extra for them to tell me I have to pay for their mistake. My partner's excitement has become significant disappointment and I had to figure out what to do. This wasn't just a Christmas present, it was also something he needs for school. We can't have no software, so their offer of a refund is something I can't take. I just now have software that I will have to replace later instead of software that will last him throughout his classes as I intended.I expect better from retail companies. I expect companies to pay for their own mistakes and then fix them, not pass that burden on to their consumers. My living situation might not be their fault, but it's not an uncommon one for their prospective clientele. I know that I won't be recommending them to anyone I know."

It was my error; I should have read (and thought about) the description more carefully. In my defense, tax prep is always for the previous calendar year, and I probably thought \"2016, so 2015 is right\", and kept going. Since the package was opened, it's non-returnable and I'm just writing it off to experience. A prominent banner stating \"PREVIOUS YEARS\" or something like that, making it more obvious, would have been appreciated, though.They quickly delivered exactly what I ordered.

I received an \"already activated\" error when using them.\r The first product key worked, the remaining 5 did not. When I tried to use the 2nd product key a month after purchase, I notified SoftwareCW of the problem and they got back to me with a new product key 2 days later. I only allocate one Office license every few weeks, so I did not know anything was wrong until a month after purchase. So far, SoftwareCW has issued me one (1) new product key.\r Now, it's near the end of January 2014 and I just noticed that the remaining 4 unused product keys were invalid (i.e., got the already activated message after installation). I trust SoftwareCW will provide me with 4 unused product keys, but we shall see.\r Over the past year, I have purchased operating systems, database software and a few other miscellaneous software packages from them and have not had an issue with those purchases. Overall the experience has been okay.\r So far, they have been trustworthy and have responded within 1 or 2 days to inquiries.\r Here are some additional thoughts...\rSoftwareCW often appears to be the price leader for big-name software.\rAll questions, comments and problems must be communicated via e-mail.\rThey do have a toll-free number (888-973-0315), but it immediately goes to voice mail with a recorded message saying that they do not offer support via the telephone.\rThey are slow-to-respond compared with the big-name online stores like NewEgg and Amazon."

I'd purchased a program that I thought was for the Mac but, come to find out, it was for a PC. My aunt had passed away and I was making a program for her service. I researched different software that day and ended up choosing the Hallmark one. The price was right, and so was the program. Everything has a learning curve and this was no exception. I chose to make a card as it would give me four pages to type on. The first, her picture, date of birth, death and a nice verse. The second  page, a poem, third page the order of service and the fourth page, the eulogy. During the time that I was working on it, I became very frustrated. Looking back now, I realize it was because I was in a bind to get it done that night so that I could send it to my cousin in Oklahoma and I was exhausted.  I was able to put it together exactly how I wanted it. I'd like to see much more clipart but I haven't had the time to play with it again to look and see if I just missed it. I ended up going online and downloaded what I needed. After I chose the font I wanted, I tried to print it and ended up with what looked like hieroglyphics.  i ended up having to use the basic Times Roman. It looked fine, just not what I wanted. I still need to go back and research what happened and why. My cousins were delighted with the program and I was pleased that it has a low learning curve and I picked up on how to use it quickly."

          "Titre": "Windows 7 Professional  64 bit retail/Prompt Customer Service",
          "Contenu": "I purchased Windows 7 Professional 64 bit (retail version)DVD,not OEM, from SoftwareCW on October 4, 2016 for a custom build PC that I planned on building a few months  from now.  After receiving the product in the mail, I got kind of skeptical about whether or not I will discover that the OS was genuine, so I emailed customer service about returning the product and the reason I decided to do so.  They reassured me that if I discovered that I was unable to use the product key for this OS I would get a full refund for the purchase, which wasn't cheap.  That gave me some peace of mind and I highly appreciated customer service prompt response to my concern and resolution option should any issue arise with this purchase.  Besides that, it's a plus for me that any company is still offering Windows 7 Professional for purchase, which I believe is suppose to end on Oct. 31 for both retail and OEM versions.  I will update this review upon completing my custom build."
