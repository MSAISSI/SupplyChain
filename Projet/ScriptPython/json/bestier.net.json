For me to order a replacement I would have to pay double what I paid for the original desk. When I notified support they offered a measly $5 coupon. No thanks. Informed support to cancel both my orders after that slap in the face. After that they finally refunded the original desk purchase but they still haven't refunded the second even though I have an email stating they sent the request for cancelation."

          "Contenu": "My mother purchased this wine cabinet and had it sent to me. She lives in Florida and I live in Kentucky. When the cabinet arrived the bottom of the box was torn open and a lot of tape covered the hole. I contacted your company because I was missing what I thought was the instructions and hardware. Kathya F. emailed me the instructions (parts list) and said make sure everything else was there. I was missing quite a few small pieces. I emailed her the list and my address. She emailed back and said the parts should arrive in 5-7 business days. The next day she emailed and said we are shipping a whole new cabinet and it should be here sooner. She would email me a tracking number. I didn\u2019t get a tracking number so I called and spoke with Kathya again. She said give her 24hrs and she would have one. I confirmed my address with her to make sure it was coming to me and not my mom. She said yes. The next day I got the tracking number. After it shipped it showed the delivery to my mom in Florida. So I called back and Kathya got it all straightened out and I finally got my cabinet. But when this one arrived the box was in the same shape as the first one. But this one had all the pieces and I\u2019m satisfied."

However in my model some of the screws didn't align right during assembly - don't know if it was just my unit but it's something to be aware of. Rather satisfied with the build quality and this purchase; would recommend if you need a desk at a budget"

There's some small deformities and inconsistencies like gaps and misalignments, but I wasn't expecting perfection. The price feels a bit high but I'm not that experienced. All in all I'd use the service again but I did not develop brand loyalty or anything. The over all experience was good but not revolutionary."

Ordering was a breeze, and when I realized I made a mistake in my shipping address they were quick to respond to my request to update the address.The desk was delivered on time, wasn't missing any parts, and was simple enough to assemble with the tools provided (though pay close attention to where the holes on the individual parts are, given the multiple configuration options it can be easy to have one of the legs the wrong way). The desk looks great and is super sturdy so I'm very pleased with everything."
