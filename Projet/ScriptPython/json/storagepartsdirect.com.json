          "Contenu": "I am editing my review because in responding to my review I was called a liar, which I am not. Storage Parts Direct advertised DPS-1200SB power supplies on their website.  I ordered 2 of them.  When placing my order the Spare Part No 660185-001 was referenced and I attempted to contact them both by Chat and Email with no answer.  I was later contacted via Email by Storage Parts Direct Sales Team and I asked them to verify that the Spare Part No 660185-001 was in fact the DPS-1200SB.  Their answer was \"Both Numbers belong to exactly the same Power Supply. 660185-001 is the Spare Part number and DPS-1200 SB is the model number\". Thus assured I ordered 2 supplies.  When I received them one was the DPS-1200 SB and the 2nd was a Model number HSTNS-PL30, a similar supply that I cannot use.  When I asked for a replacement with the DPS-1200 or a refund I got a one word response Refused.  I no longer want the correct supply.  I want a refund."

Two days later, item still hasn't shipped.Called twice (left 1 voicemail), tried to chat twice and sent a message through the platform, still no response.Looks to be no way to cancel the order through the portal. If you need something that has to ship the same day, I would probably look at another website as there is no guarantee they will ship as they say."

The website (storagepartsdirect.c o m/hpe-791034-b21-1-8tb-10krpm-2-5in-sas-12g-sc-enterprise-g8-g9-g10-hdd) for the item clearly states three times there is 3 year warranty.  There are no disclaimers or conditions.  From their product description on the website:SKU:791034-B21UPC:00888793661833MPN:791034-B21CONDITION:Brand New in Factory Sealed BoxWARRANTY:3 Years WarrantyHPE 791034-B21 1.8TB 10000RPM 2.5inch Small Form Factor 512e Dual Port SAS-12Gbps Smart Carrier Hot-Swap Enterprise Hard Drive for ProLiant Gen8 Gen9 Gen10 Servers (3 Years Warranty)The HPE 791034-B21 Enterprise Hard Drive has a 2.5 inch form factor and a 12 Gbps external data transfer rate. It has a spindle speed up to 10000 RPM and a 1.8 TB capacity. This Small Form Factor Dual Port Hard Drive uses a SAS-12Gbps (serial attached SCSI) interface and comes with 3 Years Warranty.I had a drive fail and it has taken me a few weeks of me constantly following up to have them refuse to honor their stated warranty.  Their response is: We clearly wrote that these drives come with the 3 Years HPE Warranty. And for replacement or return our RMA Period is valid for 30 Days. That is clearly written in our Return Policy at h t t ps://www.storagepartsdirect.c o m/return-policy/.  This is not on the product page anywhere.  If it is true, they sold me a drive that sat for more than a year.It is terribly disappointing to have this happen.  The 3 year warranty was one of the selling points for my purchase."

Better inventory control and communication will improve this experience. Will give them a try again in the future."

I purchased 2 HPE-branded drives that were supposed to be \"Brand New Factory Sealed.\" The drives were delivered and work but are not able to be registered with HPE. During warranty check no information is available. Trying to link warranties there was an error: \"This entitlement is inactive and cannot be linked.\" I contacted the seller and they indicated that they'll replace the drives if it becomes necessary. I've purchased drives from other vendors and had no issues registering them; your mileage may vary but personally, I don't plan to buy from this seller again."

          "Contenu": "A specific HP Part number memory was ordered. HP 774172-001.  A certified replacement memory for the server to match the other memory in the server which was (Hynix).  What was received did not have the HP PN 774172-001 on it.  But it did PN# 752369-081 which on my original memory.  However the maker was (Samsung) not (Hynix).  This did seem right at all.  I was force to track it down.  Called HPE.  They confirmed they did in fact use multiple vendors under assembly PN# HP 752369-081.The original goal was have same memory.  That reason for a any replacement number.  That's not what getting,  HP's mistake here. HPE says it 100% all works together but it's not what expected at all.  Nor what I wanted.  DIfferent makers working together is bad receipt.  In one sense you say the order was filled.  In another the goal was not met because it doesn't all match.  With a long Memtest86+ round testing to indicate to me if it all works or not.  It's running.  I'll see in 3 days from now.  If there going to multiple vendors for assy# then there should a multiple check boxes to state who the vendor was.  If it passes all the testing i'll change this to four stars.   I think in the future companies are just going have send blown up actual pictures of the memory before its purchase.  It's going to be only way to avoid this issue."
