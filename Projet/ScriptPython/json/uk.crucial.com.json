So I then contact them on that date and they said we promise it will be with you by two days ago.No refund received. Contact Crucial customer services and they said they will now escalate it and the refund will be processed within 24 hours.Have I received a refund? No. I have to keep chasing and provide the same information over and over again.I am thinking of reporting Crucial to the trading standards as by law they must refund me in a swift manner, and this has been going on over a month now.Beware!"

          "Contenu": "I placed an order for an SSD hard drive and RAM with Crucial on December 1, 2023, with an expected delivery time of 5 business days. Unfortunately, it took them 19 days to deliver my package, greatly exceeding the promised timeframe. Moreover, I had to proactively reach out to customer service to obtain a tracking number, which should have been provided promptly after the order. The customer service consultant I spoke to was not only unhelpful but also exhibited rudeness. Overall, my experience with Crucial was disappointing and did not meet the standards one would expect from a reputable company."

The package was posted through my letter box with the rest of my mail so I had no chance to reject it. In order to make a claim on Royal Mail after using Tracked 24 it must be the sender that makes the claim as the sender will have the information required to make the claim. Goods sent using Tracked 24 are insured up to the value of \u00a3200 so what needs to happen is that Crucial makes a claim on Royal Mail for the value of the missing goods and send me replacements for the goods I have not received, preferably  using registered post for which a signature is required."

A link was provided to Amazon and I purchased from there understanding that inserting the purchased Amazon/Crucial memory would fill the only remaining RAM slot and provide 16GB in total. Unfortunately, when I subsequently opened the computer, I had 4GB in each existing slot and therefore now have a just 12GB after upgrade. The Crucial technical direction was misleading and I would not have purchased if the advice had been clearer. I raised this with Crucial but they offered no assistance. Disappointed \u2639"

I tried to use their \"contact us\" system to request help but after filling it out and pressing the \"submit\" button nothing happens. Poor customer service attitude, which is a pity as they used to be OK.Edit - although the tracking number links to somebody called Spring, that then links to Royal Mail 24. Crucial help chat say that free shipping takes 10 working days. So beware, their free shipping is a very poor service.Edit 2 - Crucial have said that they do not have details to comment on so here they are. Shipment Tracking Numbers: QS332482815GB (spring) Product SKU\t CT1000T500SSD8\tCrucial T500 1TB PCIe Gen4 NVMe M.2 SSD\tOrder Number: 1111933534339 Order Date: 20 November 2023Edit 3 - I've now had 2 separate emails from Crucial. Both confirm that the goods were shipped on 26 November. I had earlier had an email saying they were shipped on 21 November and so payment had been taken. I wonder which is true? Both the emails say that free shipping (apologies I am a cheapjack) means 10 working days. Therefore one tells me to wait until 8 December before chasing and the other (with the same information) 11 December. Not too hot on accuracy these folk as they can't seem to even agree internally. I'm minded to bin the thing when I get it as I have completely lost any trust in the company. The more they justify themselves the worse it gets."

I followed the returns process using an RMA code supplied. The SSD drive was confirmed as received at K Line on 12 October. I was advised that I needed to allow 10 working days before a replacement could be issued to me. The 10 days have expired and still absolutely no feedback or contact from Crucial. I have spoken to the customer team in an overseas office 3 times and the chat service 4 times. They said it would be escalated and I would hear immediately - I did not. Given that the SSD drive was used to back up my computer files I am left exposed whilst awaiting a resolution of this painful process. I am mightily unimpressed with the whole process. If someone from Crucial reads this would you have the decency to get in touch with me. I am at the end of my tether with this."

At the top off the page it quite clearly states offers are a maximum of 5 per person, and the sale had been agreed at the lower price in the cart.  I contacted customer services by Web chat. They were unhelpful but escalated for me. 48hrs later I've still no update. Equally,  6 days later neither order has actually shipped. 1 sent via royal mail still says we are awaiting your parcel and UPS says the same thing.As the code was overturned on my second order I could have ordered from amazon, for less and with next day delivery. I reached out to customer services a third time and have only received lip service. Only buy your ram for crucial if your prepared to wait 2 weeks and pay more than you can elsewhere."

It has not been scanned by UPS once. I contacted Crucial last week and was told they wouldn't do anything until today. Contacted this morning and all they say it the will send to the \"concern\" team which may take 10 business days before they will consider resending or refunding the obviously lost order. It has been 11 days since i placed my order and not one bit of tracking has been logged by UPS. Clearly been shipped from Czechia but looks like it was never picked up by UPS. I used to use crucial for work purchases but they are now far too unreliable to use again. If i had realized it was coming from abroad i would never have used them for what is an urgent order. Telling me it will take upwards of 3 weeks all in to get my money back or send replacements is simply not good enough.#UPDATE: this morning i was promised an email back updating me on where my parcel was and i have had nothing. I phoned customer support again who repeated the same lines saying it has been escalated and they want a few days to look into it. This was meant to be shipped on a 3 - 5 day expediated delivery and the tracking still says it was never shipped. UPDATE2# crucial did contact me and all they have said is i have to wait up to 10 days before they will either consider refunding or replacing. I will be lucky if i get the memory i ordered within a month of ordering it. They seem to be doing as almost nothing to resolve this issue, they are just sitting on it and hoping it will turn up. # reposted here as i had linked to us site rather than uk.crucial.com. Issue still stand though"

          "Contenu": "A complaint from a customer in the UK who ordered from UK-CRUCIAL.COM, but as yet hasn't receive their goods despite the fact I was advised it was on 24 tracked delivery from RM. I ordered 2 x 32gb SSD for my PC from uk-crucial.com on the 17th May. On the 18th May, I was advised of the RM tracking number on Royal Mail 24. However the info on RM never updated, and by 22nd May, the tracking had not changed and there was no record of the goods being processed via RM.I contact RM who advised they hadn't received it and if they had, that it would be in their system in under 12 hrs. I contacted Crucial twice on Monday 22nd May and on both instances I was misfed information and it was not made clear. The first online support agent, told me that it was near a weekend and the system in RM had not had a chance to update - I needed to allow 10 days. - yeah right, it was not a Bank Holiday weekendThe second support agent again said was part of the Spring shipping (This was never explained to me), it could take 10 days and if i hadnt received it by 2nd June, to contact them again.Today I contacted them again by phone, this time it started to be clearer, the memory I ordered came from Prague, it is shipped by a courier company called SPRING, and travels from Prague to UK on their service and then when it arrives in UK, it is picked up by Royal Mail on a 24 hr delivery. They supplied me with the link to Spring, and I can see my goods were shipped on the 18th, and currently on the 23rd May its in Germany, I was advised it will hit the UK for delivery on 25th or 26th May, with the latest being Monday 29th May!So the information about 24hr Royal Mail is in effect not true, its only 24hr from when Royal Mail receive it, which will be 9/10 days from when it was \"posted\" in Prague. Be warned. NOT a good service and I would suggest using Amazon who will deliver on Prime in 24hrs! It would be helpful is UK Crucial advised their customers of the International part and that goods can take longer and not to rely on the RM Track 24 number!"

From what I can tell the items were sent from Germany, so normally with standard post would be 3 days (I've had normal post deliveries from Germany previously turn up next-day) so no excuse for 14 days. I'm guessing these were not posted for many days after the order was placed, or they were originally in China (or similar country). If not for this I would have given a FULL 5 STARS."

But trying to get some support for their faulty SSD software is impossible, the tech support are really clueless now.For 2 weeks, just been given the run around from the same 3 line script, reinstall, try another pc, check firmware. I've given up dealing with them and are worried if any other issues arise.The performance of both hardware ram + ssd are faultless and I've found to use command line tools that work from their website as a work around.Kinda pathetic considering their stature and technical capabilities previously."

The is that I used Paypal to pay, which meant that Crucial took the delivery address from Paypal, and somehow the first line of the address wasn't included. This meant that the courier couldn't deliver the package, although their system said it had been. I spoke to Crucial pointing out the problem and that they need to contact the courier, as that was the only route to resolve the issue. The Crucial staff member ignored that and told me to contact them instead. I don't know why the address line was missing as it was there in the Paypal account record. I've asked Paypal for a refund as I haven't received what I ordered and apparently Crucial aren't willing to help sort out why."

This fixed the issue almost immediately. It wasn't rocket science. Windows will only recognise and use up to 2TB. Anything above that has to be partioned as another drive. If you can't be bothered to consider a decent use case for cloning from Windows to a larger than 2TB hard drive (Costing \u00a3300+) and also, keep your support software and instructions up to date, then I don't think I can be bothered to shop with you again any time soon.

This tracking showed the items didn't ship for 13 days then suddenly did. Customer services were adamant they had shipped but chose not to address facts in black and white. I could have ordered the same goods from amazon with next day delivery for cheaper, even with the sale price and discount code so it was quite underwhelming. Eventually C.S refunded my carriage fee. Worth noting I had placed 2 orders at the same time. 1 normal free shipping,  1 express. Had the royal mail not mis sorted the normal one, it would have arrived a day before the express rather than the same day. Had Customer services said the goods will take 2 weeks to come from Thailand to Eastern Europe fulfilment Centre, or they are being built at the factory for example , I would not have panicked. They did not give any reassurances, ignored their own tracking information and it took multiple emails over 2 weeks to make zero progress. I love Crucial products.

I ordered 2 x 32gb SSD for my PC from uk-crucial.com on the 17th May. On the 18th May, I was advised of the RM tracking number on Royal Mail 24. However the info on RM never updated, and by 22nd May, the tracking had not changed and there was no record of the goods being processed via RM.I contact RM who advised they hadn't received it and if they had, that it would be in their system in under 12 hrs. I contacted Crucial twice on Monday 22nd May and on both instances I was misfed information and it was not made clear. The first online support agent, told me that it was near a weekend and the system in RM had not had a chance to update - I needed to allow 10 days. - yeah right, it was not a Bank Holiday weekendThe second support agent again said was part of the Spring shipping (This was never explained to me), it could take 10 days and if i hadnt received it by 2nd June, to contact them again.Today I contacted them again by phone, this time it started to be clearer, the memory I ordered came from Prague, it is shipped by a courier company called SPRING, and travels from Prague to UK on their service and then when it arrives in UK, it is picked up by Royal Mail on a 24 hr delivery. They supplied me with the link to Spring, and I can see my goods were shipped on the 18th, and currently on the 23rd May its in Germany, I was advised it will hit the UK for delivery on 25th or 26th May, with the latest being Monday 29th May!So the information about 24hr Royal Mail is in effect not true, its only 24hr from when Royal Mail receive it, which will be 9/10 days from when it was \"posted\" in Prague. Be warned. NOT a good service and I would suggest using Amazon who will deliver on Prime in 24hrs! It would be helpful is UK Crucial advised their customers of the International part and that goods can take longer and not to rely on the RM Track 24 number!"

What has become apparent is that Crucial simply do not work at weekends.

That shouldn't really be a problem - except that the item then took days to reach Holland (via Germany). It then, according to the tracking record, left Holland on 24th November. It is now 26th, and the item appears to have disappeared into the ether.

Regardless, having such limited means to contact the company means that I shall certainly hesitate before ever buying anything else from Crucial.I know that Crucial make good products. These difficulties with contacting them, however, make for poor advertising for the company as a whole.Update on 2nd December.I have now reduced my overall opinion of Crucial from two stars to one star.It is now eight days since my order left The Hague en route to the UK, having previously taken three days to reach Holland from The Czech Republic.It is clearly lost, but Crucial still insist - during the course of a long chat (and despite the advice that I could \"escalate\" the matter; see their response below) - that I wait the full ten business days before they will \"help\" me with a refund. Incidentally, ten business days does not count from the day that I submitted the order, but from the day that Crucial submitted the order to the courier. Since it is impossible to contact the company over the weekend I shall have waited well over two weeks for an order which, barring total miracles, will not arrive, and they know it will not arrive. I asked them three times whether there was any additional information they could provide which might lead me to believe otherwise. On each occasion they simply ignored the question.The suggestion in Crucial's previous response that Royal Mail strikes might be contributing to the delay is a complete red herring. The strikes would not have prevented the handover from Spring, the original carrier, to Royal Mail. RM, on their own website are quite clear that they are expecting the package, but have not so far received it.There is also, contrary to the information provided by Crucial in their response, no email contact listed on the link they cite.Final update - 6th DecemberAnother tedious 40 minutes on Crucial's Chat. They did finally agree to make an immediate refund; though no offer of compensation. What they offered me was ten per cent off my next order; as though I would even consider ordering anything else off them after this experience.I have upgraded this review to two stars. At least the refund did indeed come through within minutes."

Showed all kit was in stock at time of order.  3 days pass, order still showing as in progress, get on live chat to them, get told waiting on a part to come back into stock, give it 24 hours.  Check again 24 hours later, after seeing part is in stock on the website, then goes out of stock the morning after.  Contact support again, get told to wait a week until part comes in.  Ask how they can show the part as in stock on day of order but not allocate the stock to the customer that ordered it, and how stock can come back in and not be allocated for an already placed order (This was an 8GB stick of 2666 RAM, don't think that people were buying hundreds of these).  Get told that my order is a priority order and that I need to wait a week, delivery will be refunded, no response to my question on allocation of stock.  Contact support later in the day to arrange a cancellation as not wanting to wait another week for kit to be delivered, customer service tries to tell me that this is a priority order and that they are working on getting this kit out and that due to CoVID it may take some time, again completely ignoring my request.  Pushed for a cancellation, got a cancellation request number.Got a text on my phone at 6pm yesterday telling me that UPS have a parcel for me, after checking the origination country find out it is Crucial, so had to cancel my order to get them to send me the equipment that was ordered.  If this had been due to CoVID I wouldn't have minded (have some stuff ordered with another supplier that can't get it to me because of the lockdown), this is poor stock management and mis-allocation of purchases.Customer service only try and fob you off with excuses and time lines that mean they don't have to deal with you for a while."

There was no indication on their site about how long it would take to be delivered and, having found out that it was coming from Prague, there was no option to cancel the order and order from someone else.This is appalling service from a well-respected company which does nothing to enhance their reputation. I wish now that I had bought it from Amazon as it was available with next day delivery. I will never shop with Crucial again.Having seen Crucial\u2019s reply and other comments similar to mine, it seems that the information on shipping times is not clearly stated when people order from the site. Rather than simply repeating what they said to others, they should take steps to ensure that people are really clear about the shipping times for different delivery options."

I would never have purchased if I had known.There was a cheaper option from Amazon US which I did not take because I thought Crucial would have been quicker. The G.Skill product looked much better, was cheaper and would have got here much sooner.The order was for a laptop that I bought from Taiwan. That got here is 3 days so 12 days from the EU is disgraceful.I feel that not disclosing the location and delivery time is simply fraud. They hide behind UK contact details when they are not in the UK. This should be illegal.Update following comment from Crucial.All of my comments still stand. I should not have to read a shipping policy to clearly understand that you are not shipping from the UK. If you are merely an EU company you should make that very clear.Your response shows that you don't care and that you are hiding behind a shipping policy document.If I cannot clearly see the shipping details you are failing as a company and my review was to make it clear to any other customers in the UK that they woulld be better off purchasing elsewhere."

In the end he just hung up on  me, which was ABSOLUTELY POOR SERVICE.I managed to resolve the problem myself in the end.  I'm not really sure how, but by keeping trying, it eventually worked.I have however found that some software seems to think that the install is on a new machine and I have had to resolve activation code issues with software vendors.I'm not completely ignorant on PC matters and have done a similar upgrade on a laptop in the past without problems.I will think very carefully before going down this route again in future.My advice is always buy a bigger drive than you think you'll need in the first place."

The first issue I experiences was with the website it looked very insecure (it did not seem very professionally set up, it did was glitchy and did not render well) and took a couple of attempts to put my order through. Immediately after I submitted my order I realised that making a mistake on my order and attempted to cancel it, unfortunately, the 'order cancellation' option did not appear on the page despite me just placing my order (and customer service was not available). Once my item arrived I decide to return it as was my right only to be informed by crucial (via e-mail) that I (the buyer) would have to pay for the return postage (not stated on crucial's website return policy) and I would have to post it to the Czech Republic (I am based in the UK) so that would have been tracked international secured postage. Once I received the 'delivered' notification from the courier I contact crucial customer service to confirm delivery which they confirmed (that was 2.5 weeks ago) and I am still waiting for my refund."

Nowhere on the website, when i ordered, did i see it mentioned that in fact the external ssd will shipped from Czech Republic. It took 13 days to arrive! (partly due to uk customs) Had I know this, I would have ordered from amazon or curry's or any other place with local stock."

The issue is the Acronis software you can download to clone a HDD to the new SSD. Dropped 2 stars for the software. Gave up using Acronis after wasting 3 days and too many hours trying to get it to work, it\u2019s slow, it hangs and gets stuck at different times and could never provide estimated times left with the cloning process. In the end, purchased EaseUS ToDo Backup for \u00a333 and it completed the cloning process in 3hrs for a 3TB HDD to the 4TB SSD with no issues, or hangs, and it provides constant information on the process. I would say, you need to factor in purchasing the disk cloning software if that\u2019s your intention for the new SSD\u2026 or purchase from another manufacturer that provides better cloning software for you new SSD."

I contacted UPS and after some discussion, I was advised that UPS DON'T do delivery slots despite one being sent to me.  They also have a driver who seems to make up his own story regarding the closing time for the Establishment Mail Office which is, and has been for a long time, 1500m on a Friday.  I even offered to meet the driver such was the need for the drives that weekend.  Apparently wasn't achievable. He clearly had no intention of delivering your package on that day.  This resulted in the vital work that I needed to complete over the weekend, with the ordered drives, not being done.  I guess that when someone orders something from Crucial, you trust your Couriers to 'deliver' on your behalf.  This was EXTREMELY poor in this case.     The 3 stars are based upon the great deal that you offered - thank you"

So I paid for what is essentially a piece of bent metal that is designed for PC's NOT iMac so it's a bodge job to fit it.The installation instructions for the iMac are excellent and easy to follow but they refer to keeping the HDD thermal monitor cable available to connect to the SSD when there is no facility on the SSD that is specific to the iMac to refit this.Major downside as the fan in the iMac now runs as if it is trying to cool a blast furnace down because it is not getting data from a sensor. The fix - spend $44 on a third party cable or add some third party software to control the fan.Not good enough Crucial, if you sell drives that are certified 100% compatible by your own compatibility checker, make sure that this is correct otherwise you are misleading customers. Also make sure the HDD adapter is fit for purpose, make one that fits the iMac without having to bodge it in.You have lost any future business, I will seek alternatives for my other iMac's"

          "Titre": "Good hardware let down by poor instructions",
          "Contenu": "I bought a memory module and an SSD to upgrade my computer. I planned to keep the old hard drive for backup storage. Once I had finished, I ended up with everything I wanted and a PC with better performance than when it was brand new. Based on this, you may ask why I only awarded this 3 stars. The answer is in the instruction for upgrading, or mostly the information that is missing from them. Installing the hardware was fairly straight forward. The SSD only took a few seconds. The memory module did require more force than I would like to use to fully insert it but other than that was simple. The problem came when I started up the upgraded PC It instantly recognised the new memory but there was nothing on the new SSD and there was nothing on windows to indicate it was there. Nothing on the instructions about this other than to say to try re-inserting it which I did but nothing changed. It was only when going into the BIOS on the next restart that I could see it had been recognised but when I got back into windows it still showed nothing. At this point I decided to try the next step of downloading and running the software to copy the hard drive to SSD. This ran and did identify that there was a SSD present. The issue here is that it showed internal names for both the source and destination drive not the windows names. I could have just assumed they were correct and gone ahead but that appeared very dangerous so rebooted and back into the BIOS again where I could see the internal drive names before going back into windows again to run the clone software. This all worked fine so all I had to do was reboot and go back into the BIOS to change the boot drive and restart windows which also all worked fine. One final problem. The original hard disk and new SSD looked identical so I could not tell which one was using the C: and new E: drive letters. The drive properties did not show the internal names. The only way I could tell was by looking at the last updated date/time on windows files and seeing which ones had been updated after switching boot drives. I could have avoided all these issues if the instructions only mentioned that Windows would not initially see the new drive, how the drives would be seen by the cloning software and how windows would allocate drive letters."

Worked well and easy to unpack fit1 out of 5 for shipping time transparency.  Took 9 days to arrive so not for anyone in a hurry.  Main problem is that I just didn't realise what was going on.  Products are now shipped from Czech Republic rather than Glasgow - have bought loads from Crucial but nothing since Brexit.  Shortly after placing the order tracking info showing Royal Mail Tracked 24 appears with status waiting for supplier to hand over the goods so I though it was going to be quick.  A couple of days later I noticed that there was a more elaborate tracking link that showed Prague as the origin.  It only took a couple of days after that to reach Heathrow, but then it sat there for 5 more days (not clear if stuck in customs or simply awaiting Royal Mail to collect it from there - my guess the latter).  After RM collected it, it was delivered the next day, a total of 9 working days after the order.  The website does state \"clearly\" if you bother digging into the small print that free delivery is 9-10 working days so they met their SLA.  It's more that I didn't notice it wasn't coming from East Kilbride anymore as it used to.  My bad ?Anyway, it arrived, it works.  It was 25% cheaper than Amazon for what I bought,  so overall I'm happy and would use again for things I'm not in hurry for and which are dramatically cheaper than elsewhere.If Crucial had stressed that products are supplied from the EU and that 5-10 Business days for free delivery means 5-10 Business days for delivery I would have given 5*."
