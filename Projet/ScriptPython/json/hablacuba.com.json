I have no idea how can someone even give them 1 star?  I use Nobtel, and have better service with them.  Anyone interest try to using them you get 40 minutes for $20 calling Cuba.  This people respond back like if I am stupid, and forgot to add the area code.  They claim that they checked there system.  How could they respond so fast without even taking the time too check.  Another thing the calls keeps dropping in between, and when I have called they tell me it's my line.  How is that possible if I am using my land line, and calling a land line."

What was even more bothersome was hablacuba's refusal to accept responsibility for their error and their insistence that the issue had nothing to do with them and that I had to take my complaints to ETECSA. When I asserted that the transaction was between hablacuba and me and that ETECSA would not even recognize my complaint (technically, perhaps ETECSA was correct because it was hablacuba who had charged my credit card), hablacuba went silent on me. I thought, in that scenario, they were very evasive and irresponsible. AT THE END and inspite of all my efforts,  I WAS CHARGED FOR THE REDIT THAT WAS NEVER GIVEN! So I took my complaint to American Express and they credited my Amex account."

However, when I started to use it, I was doing a recharge per month and little by little the time was reduced and now we have to recharge every two weeks for the same price.I think you exaggerate a lot and I would like a return to reality for everyone !!! Paying 40 euros a month is just inadmissible. For the time being, I consider that you are abusing of the situation and you are stealing your clients.Let's see if you are going to publish my comment...."

          "Contenu": "The reason I did not give 5 stars is that I have written HablaCuba several times about mysterious shortages in the amount of credits received by my recipient of recharges I have paid for.  It has happened when I have purchased recharges during evening hours, weekends, and Sundays. I ask HablaC to investigate why my recharge amount was reduced. The replies are always the same form letter response. \"...the recharge was received...\" My recipient is a trusted family member that would not deceive me as to the amount they received. Consequently. I have learned to only send recharges during normal business hours and only Mon thru Frid. So far this has worked. I surmise some entity after hours is skimming off the recharge amounts or Cubatel cannot be trusted. HablaCuba seems powerless to correct the problem."

I have found them very honest and never had any problems getting minutes to my friend's cellphone.On the negative side, I did not understand how to purchase minutes and my translator could not explain beyond telling me others use this method.  The site seems to be mostly for Spanish speaking users, although it is translated into English for those that do not know Spanish.  There is just not much information to explain things.  For example, there are other things available on the site than cell minutes, but I do not understand what they are for.Thank you for your invaluable service to the continuing friendship between our two nations."
