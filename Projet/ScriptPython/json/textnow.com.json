You cant trust the service if they dont respect ot protect us the consumer.  I dont write reviews but a number I have circulated for years I now have lost access to including numbers and media."

They withhold showing users certain Area Codes so they can keep them to themselves and for customers using a different IP address. I would NOT use them.

I needed wifi access for just one week so paid the 4.99 and turned off auto renewal so I wouldn't be charged. One the wifi never worked so it was useless paying for that service and two, a month and a half in i kept getting charged once a week for this service for 4.99 which over drafts my account eveytime since I have no money in that account which is 15 dollars everytime. I still owe about 80 dollars of overdraft fees because of this company and they don't care. Can't call them, you can only message them. They don't say sorry or nothing but they do atleast refund my 4.99 fee and as I'm writing this I got a notification that they took out 4.99 once again and I have discontinued this service a week ago. And messaging them is a joke because you can't turn off your screen and sometimes you have to wait three hours for someone to come on. I let me screen go black for 5 mins and came back on and they got on and said sorry we didn't reach you and closed the chat. They have my number just text me atleast.

Then, they pull my number 306-718-5575, without any reason, nor warning. They must have wanted the number for someone else. Oddly enough, I was just going to contact the business to see if it would be possible to get a sim to use in my phone too. The company is out of Canada, and offers free text and calls in Canada and the USA. It offers very low cost calls internationally. But, what good is any of it, if you suddenly do not have any account or phone number to communicate. If this had not happened, I would probably have given the company a 5 star review because up until this sudden stripping of usage, I was always telling everyone about the great company. Now, I tell them to avoid it unless they want to wake up one morning to find they no longer can communicate with others due to a company that cares very little how they affect the users.  Mostly, it is heartless when they see the messages and know that people are dealing with loss."

It was the only way that I could stay in touch with them, because my data is useless in the country area I live in. I used it one day, then woke up the next day and it had logged me out of all of my devices. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and logging in again (per advice of their help article) and it still said \"Something went wrong try again later\" after two days I finally contacted the live chat. Which by the way is the ONLY way you can reach them. They informed me that my account had been permanently deleted and I cannot undo this. I cannot get any of my messages or call logs from within the account there is no access to it. They gave me no email warning or anything. Their excuse was I violated terms of use. I asked how because I only used it for basic calls and messages. I asked is calling doctors a violation of your policy? Like what a joke. He just gave me a link in the chat to read their terms of use and told me again I was in permanent violation. I told him I will just leave a bad review. Outside of that, it makes me uncomfortable that they're logging and reading through our conversations or phone calls. That's creepy. Don't use TextNow. They're a poor excuse for a app that's supposed to help people communicate."

I just paid the 4.99 to have my phone be able to accept sms code texts after signing up only 1 week ago. I have been flooded with your ads and the app would crash constantly, but  really did not have a choice of what to do right now because I just got off the street from being homeless 3 months. Your company was my bridge to my new phone with service from a local provider. Obvioulsy, you dont give a crap about people trying to get on their feet and  will be posting this on TrustPilot and Google Play as soon as I am done here. I did  violate any damn terms and I want my 4.99 returned to my card asap or the next step will be the . Your company is a scam. How many peope do you convince to upgrade to the sms ability which BTW, does NOT work 2/3 of the time and is seen as a VOip and not accepted. Then you harass people continuously to get the sim card or upgrade the plan. It is harassment. Once someone ignores your constant ads and pop ups to do the above, you disable their account. Say goodbye to your company and hello to a class action suit. The FCC will investigate your disabled accounts. How dare you!!This was my lifeline in between the \"rock bottom\" and getting on my own two feet and you decided to take it away for no reason. Why dont you share the information you feel is a problem with the user before disabling them?? Companies that I have applied to have this as my contact number. You are ANTI-AMERICAN and need to lose your abillity to do this to other ppeople struggling in this economy. Good luck jerks, you will need it!!!!"

Logging in to your acct can be a pain. and of course no refunds nor replacements are given and insurance is not available. the updated sim cards that they send you every year doesnt always work and that in itself is a process because your phone became locked and they have to get in touch with your carrier to unlock your phone. the good thing about it, is that you can download onto laptop, computer, tablet, any phone, so if yours breaks, theres still a way to access your messages if you have either of those electronic devices. The biggest issue is having to replace your phone every year because it will not last through the years. Thats where they are making their money. overpriced phones that dont even last a year. Ive used them for about 3 yrs now and for me personally, its been useful and helped alot but i dont like how im having to replace my phone about every 6 months. and i wish they would provide insurance"

I noticed a few \"glitches\" when making and/or receiving calls. Since the quarantine, I started using my phone more often.  This is when the \"glitches\" became more of an issue.The first week in June I contacted the on-line support and we spent several hours  trying to resolve the problem.  I was later told that the engineers found that the phone (which I bought from TextNow) was not compatible on the TextNow network.Jun 18th I went to Best Buy to find a new carrier.  I decided on ATT.  The tech inserted the new sim into the phone (from TextNow) and went through the activation process.  For some reason the phone that I was assured was unlocked was locked onto a Sprint tower.The phone was re-set to factory settings but still unable to activate it. After many calls I discovered that the phone was locked by Boost Mobile. I was forced to purchase a new phone.On June 19, 2020 I sent a letter to TextNow at your San Francisco office requesting guidance on return the phone that I could not use.  To date no reply.Today I received an email from TextNow saying that my phone number was going to be deleted unless I send a message to TextNow.  That is impossible to do since you don't have any direct phone line that can be used."

If your looking for a non existent phone bill and occasionally wifi outside your house then I recommend this app. Sometimes the audio can be choppy but just find that sweet spot and your good. I text 95% of the time so it works great. Just depends what type of phone user you are. BUT if you fall into my catagory then your straight. I'd recommend depending on what you use it for. Definitely will save you money."

Look no further than an online review sites comment section about a free app. In this world common sense and critical thinking don't matter and self entitlement levels are so high the people who are the most intentionally ignorant won't understand any of this.On to TextNow.It's a free app. It is able to afford to operate on T-Mobiles network thanks to an abundant amount of ads displayed on the app at all times, and from customers who pay to have said ads removed from their app. In order to send and receive free calls and texts, even with a TextNow sim, you must use the TextNow app to send and receive calls and texts. This means you will not use the default phone app or text message app that came pre-installed on your iphone or Android device.If you are having issues sending or receiving calls or texts while not connected to a wifi network and have their sim card, this is an issue with your signal strength on the T-Mobile network or incorrect APN settings. Both are clearly mentioned prior to setting up an account or paying for a sim.TextNow is a personal data harvesting, cheaply coded app loaded with trackers hell-bent on nothing more than profiting off selling every bit of personal and geographical location information they can get from you, but their app and services work as advertised. You should probably work on your critical thinking and google search skills if you're here calling them a scam."

The other service provider said that its me who should get it from TextNow. Its pity that TextNow is asking me to run around. Its simple they have my details and they should give it to me.New Post:Thanks for the support.. Got my Account number and Pin. Waiting for the port out."

          "Contenu": "It is not bad for what it is.We use the free service for our elderly neighbor who did not have a cell.  We had a 5-ish-year-old Android phone that was just a paperweight in our house, and we activated it with the $1 sim from the text now.  I also activated one of my old iphones, just to have a backup phone in my workbag.  I purchased the year-long phone number lock for $5 a year.  (I later noticed on my iPhone that it costs about 5$ a WEEK to have that service, so probably not worth it) For a basically free service, I really don't think it is a bad deal, but there are some things to note:-Set up isn't difficult, but does take some time.  I have activated 2 phones on this service, and I would say it took me about 30 mins each time to do so.-While you can pick your phone number (from a group of available numbers) your phone number is NOT LOCKED in unless you pay for an upgrade.  They say that you have to call or text once a day to keep from losing your numbers, but in practice, it is more like one every 3-4 weeks, and they send you a reminder text that you need to use your account.  (you can even log into the app on your personal or primary phone, and text from there to keep it active.)  For these reasons, TextNow is probably not a great business phone solution. Maybe go with Tello as a cheap paid service, or google voice is you have a phone number you can text from and link.    -Texting and Calling is through the TextNow App, NOT the default phone text of calling apps.  -There are ads in the App, but they do not bother me or my neighbor. Data is NOT included, and I believe starts at $10 a month.  This service is best used for someone who can use wifi to access the internet and just needs to talk and text otherwise.  -After using both, in my opinion, I think it works better with my old Android that my old iPhone.  Overall, I think this is a fine service that is probably getting a bad rep just because people do not understand what it is going in. I would rate it 85/100, but I am rounding up to give them some love as their service is great for my neighbor who needed it.   I hope this helps!"
