          "Contenu": "These are the absolute WORST earbuds I have ever owned, especially from Tranya. I have purchased their brand of headphones multiple times in the past and have always been satisfied up until this point. From the moment I took them out of the pack I had issues. First off, I hate the new touch sensitive pad they have on the T10s instead of an actual button to press for pause/play. Secondly, when I finally charged up the power box they come in I could only get the right earbud to even turn on. I looked up multiple solutions to try to get the left one working but nothing I tried worked for me.Lastly, the battery life on the earbuds and the charge box is absolutely TERRIBLE. As I mentioned earlier, I fully change box (and also the earbuds) and not even 24hrs later both the box and earbuds were completely dead. And I hadn't even used them! I only noticed they were dead when I went to try them out one more time before writing this review. SmhSo in conclusion, I am completely unsatisfied with this product and will probably never purchase anything from Tranya again. I'm in the process of trying to get a complete refund from them (if their customers service ever reaches back out after the multiple emails I have sent them) and send them back these trash headphones. (*PS. There is a small chance I just received an defective product and will be willing to hear out the reps if they honor my refund request. I still have a pair of the T1 buds that work but are slowly going out on me, which was the whole reason i decided to buy these to begin with.)"

After a month of waiting without an update, and a tracking number which came up as an \"error\", I began to contact the e-mail address provided in my confirmation. After a month of no reply I discovered this was an entirely incorrect e-mail address which they had given me. I then messaged the address from their site at which point they said they could find no evidence of my order (despite taking my money), once I stated that I could prove it through bank statements they offered to send a replacement package, I assumed this meant the first package got lost so I agreed. Again, no response. After a week I followed up, asking the status of the replacement, to which they responded that they could not send it to me until the first package had been returned to them. At this point I demanded a refund which I did eventually get, however, when I initially checked out I noticed an option for postal insurance claiming that Tranya wouldn't be liable for lost products otherwise. Judging by this transaction I would assume this is a common scam they pull to avoid actually sending any products out."

They then asked for photos or videos.  These are earbuds; photos and videos for earbuds that did not sync?  I asked them just what I was supposed to photo or video as they did not have any apparent physical damage or deformity.I then sent them an email explaining that two months was ridiculous and that I was going to start posting online about their apparent failed warranty process.  The email below from Tranya is apparently their attempt to get me to tell you how good everything was.  Well it wasn't and it is not worth it to me to misrepresent this experience to other potential buyers. I enjoyed the earbuds (for just over 6 months) but the non-existent warranty process would keep me from purchasing any product from Tranya in the future.

Otherwise those earphones are just not worth their price. To be more specific, I have bought Tranya T10, which was the most expensive product in their shop at that time. Bass is amazing, however they lack highs and mids. Bass is suppressing higher frequencies, so it is not what would you expect from the earphones which usually cost ~80$, but for 40$ - yeah, it is okay. Some rewievers say that highs and mids are very sharp, I can't believe them, maybe those reviews are just bought. I give 3 stars of 5 not because I have experienced something unpleasant with the website or shipping, but because I just want to let people know that their items are overpriced."

          "Contenu": "I have been using the M10 earbuds for the past year or so and I couldn't be happier with them. The sound quality from low bass to high treble is much better than any \"air pods\" style earbud I've ever tried. The only issue I have is that the Bluetooth audio codec is a slightly older style (AAC) that can't make full use of the more modern technologies like Qualcomm aptx audio (higher sample rate, more bits per sample), however they do still work just fine with my phone set to that audio codec. Having said that, the sound quality is still fantastic so I'm not sure if I'd know a difference even if I did switch it.Their customer support is also top notch with quick response times and favourable outcomes"

They were very helpful and offered to send a new one for me. They provided me quickly with the tracking number too so I can keep track of the parcel. So in case you don't get a response by email, then contact through Facebook messenger can help. The smart watch comes with a year guarantee if you register the product which my husband did. Let's hope I was just unlucky with the old one. Anyway the company didn't make a hassle and send a new one straight away, so you can rely on them."
