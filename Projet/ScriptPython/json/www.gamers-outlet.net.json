I asked for a refund, since the license did not function properly and the information on their website was misleading.Got an answer saying that i will not get a refund, because the license can no longer be sold to another customer.

The keys are priced good, but if you have to keep buying them, is it really worth it? Thus the 3 stars. If they would have supported the key I originally purchased and give me a replacement, this would have been a 5 star experience. One thing to be aware of, some of the cheaper keys require MS phone activation. Phone activation can be a real PITA and takes at least a half hour to complete. YMMV"

Just google \"The Witcher 3 RU OLD\" = name of the steam gift for more information.\r But still positive experience from the refund - too bad for majority of the people not realizing to ask it.\r *edit* rating increased to 3 stars based on apology from the store and swift communication via e-mail from their side. Also I can confirm that the description on the game in the store now better reflects the nature of the product. \r Just very carefully make sure you really get what you order by checking the name of the gift you receive and you should be good to go. If you decide to buy a RU game, be aware that there is some risk (does it work in the end, is there some content removed?) in buying those games if you do not live in Russia."

I sent a text copy of the chat to G.O., but they said they wanted the image, still trying to insist I had not proved the key was not valid.I found I still had the internet connection to Ubisoft, so sent G.O. the images of the chat, confirming the key is rubbish. I have now opened a dispute via Paypal. Edit: Support have come back to me now with an option of a full refund or a new key. I chose the new key and it is downloading now. Seems they needed the information I sent to get a refund themselves. It is a pity support did not make this clear in the first place, but perhaps they were busy, but as this is the first key I have bought, having spent a small fortune in the last 3 decades or so on software, and thought I could save some money, but at my age I could sure done without the hassle, and it seems it was a good job I was able to get the image of the chat with Ubisoft support!"

I felt I was mistreated whilst trying to purchase a game, but they have since contacted me and have done all they can to help remedy the situation.\r  I have since got my game from a different store, (in fact it was the same day), but seeing as a representative from Gamers Outlet has contacted me and has tried everything she can to sort the problems out, I have decided to edit my review for them.\r   It's inevitable that some customers will come across problems, such as I did, and will feel slighted by what happens and will leave a less-than-favourable review of the store.  As said, they have since contacted me and have been, in my opinion, pleasant to deal with, even through my scathing perception of them.  With this being said, I'm editing my review of them to 3 stars, acceptable but there was friction.  If there was a higher rating I could give that was truthful to the situation, (not on any part of the store's fault), then I would rate it that. I would even say it's \"4-Stars, but with some friction\".\r   I feel I am probably going to try this store again some time in the future.  The customer rep who emailed me was very friendly and polite, even offering a small amount of compensation for what happened. \r  In that light, I would suggest that others try this store,  hopefully to find that my problems were a one-off occurrence."

          "Contenu": "UPDATE: Support got back to me with a working Hellfighter pack key. Bumped my review up to 3* from 2. Many thanks to support for sticking with a customer till the very end.Decided to buy BF1 with the Hellfighter pack key from the site seeing the good reviews. However, little did I know that I would run into so much trouble.1) Paid with Paypal and redirected to main site, only to get a \"site down\" error from Cloudflare. Order was stuck on pending, had to email support for confirmation.2) An hour later, was asked to provide a photo of my ID and a handwritten note for verification. I don't see the need for this, and many others did not need to have to do this, so I was genuinely puzzled. This was not only a huge inconvenience, but also a risk of identity theft.3) Sent a photo of my ID for verification. Key was released near instantaneously (a plus). However, another problem surfaced: trying to download the scan of the game key on their website resulted in me getting an unopenable zero kb file. Tried with different browsers and even on my phone, nada. Had to email support AGAIN to get them to send me the game key.4) Days later, friend tried to use the Hellfighter DLC key (game was a gift for my friend), only to find out it has already been used. Contacted support, but a resolution seems unlikely since they seem to have run out of keys on the main site.  Basically, I was scammed out of a dollar. If you are thinking of purchasing from this site just to save a few bucks, my suggestion is don't. The only pleasant part of this experience (which prevented me from giving this a 1*) was the cordial and spontaneous support, but this does not excuse the trainwreck of a process of getting the game key; I would rather have a seamless experience without me having to contact support in the first place than this."

Turns out the transaction was made in Israel. I only found out after I used a legit credit card and got a warning from my bank about an international transaction and it stated it was coming from Israel. So they emailed me the keys, I downloaded the software from the \"official\" link they provided, installed the software and was able to license and register it with no problems. The description of what I was purchasing was accurate. Schit didn't hit the fan so I don't know how well the customer service is. I will use them again. I have already recommended them to many. If anything could be changed to better my experience to make it smooth transaction, it would be to have a US based transaction so I can use gift cards to purchase or at least a warning that they are not US based."
