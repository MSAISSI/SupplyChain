There were so many different issues coming from laggy transition, constant crashing and just so many problems that it was hard to see this as something I would use in the future. However, I will say the constant help from tech support was a major plus when it came to helping me fix \"some\" of the issues. But as of now I can't see myself continuing using this product as it left a very bad taste in my mouth."

We make sure to limit our farm sizes and everything to reduce lag. I will be switching to another hosting provider.UPDATE: It's now December and they upgraded my server to 6 gigs and installed some server plugin for \"free\" even though the billing started charging me +$10 extra for this shiiit. I'm done with this fuccking company and I'm just gonna start running servers off my spare PC. Dont buy from here."

It appears I had to notify them of that outage as well. Not open about issues with their equipment/network. It took several messages to even admit that there was a larger issue at play from the original tech. I've had to continually reach out for updates as there is no outage notification in the client.I have spent an entire day dealing with an excess of exclamation points and smiley faces while system admins apparently do nothing. It takes an hour max to change out a node but heaven forbid anyone actually do something that isn't remote. This problem could and should have been fixed in 2 to 3 hours max and there is still no end in sight.Bisect clearly is after quick cash and cares nothing for their customers. If they did, they would address issues with expediency and have redundancies in place to prevent such egregious failures on their part."

The first support staff member was able to help us, getting us from 300+ ticks  behind to about 30.  After another day we were back up to 200+ ticks behind so I logged another ticket.  I was once again told to send the server info via Spark commands, which I did.  I was then told it was the wrong information and to download Spark.  When I said I'd already downloaded Spark and had run the commands through /sparkc (/spark didn't register as a command), I was given a link to download Spark.  A few more \"you need to download Spark and run the /spark command\" messages later, and I just gave up and moved to a host that offered 12Gig for $30/month where my server has zero lag and zero crashing issues with more mods than we were using with Bisect as our host."

The server was in a loop where it was repeatedly running AutoCompaction over and over again and would kick everyone out of the server.Problem 2.When I contacted support, I was asked to login so they could see my services.  Ok no problem\u2026 only I was logged in on my end and informed the customer service rep.  When I attempted to log in again I began to receive odd messages from the server informing me that my email no longer existed in besecthostings records\u2026  I spent all weekend attempting to get this resolved being pasted from one tech to the next emails and live chat until I connected with Brendan G.  This tech not only got the issue resolved, they didn\u2019t pass me off to emails just to get rid of me.  Within about 15 mins the server issue was resolved and the website issues were fixed."

Now its just me and a buddy on the server but still figured id message support team and see what to do. All theyve said is to add a mod to the pack that i already had an tried to use. An then i asked it it could he set back a few hours. Yano just so i wasnt at the village anymore. Well you cant do hours at least not on this server. But all im told back is that id have to pay for a backup and it ranged from 1 day to a few days all different prices. Yes its only a dollar for a backup save but i deadass paid 30 or so for a server for two people.  Not paying anymore if you cant solve something so easy."

          "Contenu": "I had several issues playing Vault Hunters 1.16. The worst one was entering a vault, getting kicked for flying. After relogging I'd end up on the roof without being able to ever leave or enter a different vault. Iskall85 had promoted Bisecthosting and I know that they are planning to sponsor the dev team for Vault Hunters 1.18. I only hope that for their sake they make it so that it's playable. The second reason for the one star is the user interface for switching instances is confusing and complicated. I was only abler to successfully switch instances once without my vanilla world bugging out by forgetting userdata."

I feel a little less cared about right now which isn\u2019t great due to a lot of other things going on. So sadly I need to drop a few stars from my once happy review.

I tried the \"auto restore\" point to get back all of our data (The only data that should have been there); Lost. The next day on our new world it crashed twice and was accelerating in intervals of how frequent it crashed. I contacted support to see what was going on with the server. Was told it was a \"chunk tick\" issue, that it was processing too much data and was causing it to crash repeatedly. I was then informed that the support agent was going to max the limit to see if it stopped the crashing; it did not. After the third crash I contacted support again. This time they wanted to try to restore my initial world that was \"saved\" when I started the game. Still no luck and more crashing. I decided to give up and cancel my subscription to look elsewhere."

On the third day of the world, we started to receive lag spikes, which disappointed my experience with the server itself."

The dashboard provided is useful but there are no performance metrics at all. Due to this, when your server lags, you can't tell what the bottleneck actually is. (There is apparently a downloadable plugin for server stats as stated on their dashboard, but this didn't work when I downloaded it - again, this is a basic feature provided by other hosting services).If you aren't looking to load a lot of chunks at once then the server runs mostly fine. I wouldn't recommend for Vault Hunters as the mod does require chunk loading. I'd personally try another service next time."

          "Contenu": "I\u2019ve been with Bisect for less than a month and I\u2019ve had a mixed experience.One one hand, support is responsive and the server usually runs smoothly.Two big issues have come up though:1. My backup manager broke and permanently locked up one out of two manual backup slots offered on my plan. We\u2019re going on one week of this being an issue and it still isn\u2019t fixed (the ticket is open in my Support panel). The reason for this is that the automatic 7day backup process offered on the Premium plans totally broke (according to their System Admin) on my node. So\u2026 I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not a Premium subscriber? Sounds like a false sense of security.2. With the release of 1.20, server slowed down immensely, even with just a few players on the 4GB plan. When I asked support about it, it was due to high traffic. Aren\u2019t I paying for 4GB? Why does other server traffic affect mine? So they moved me to a different node to make it better. So I\u2019m happy it\u2019s fixed, but still a weird thing to have happen.Overall, I\u2019m doing my research again to see if other hosts offer a similarly robust admin panel (one of the great things about Bisect) but with a more reliable infrastructure."

I had issues with my mod list not reading because the html file got placed in its own sub folder and the server couldn\u2019t read it. I found this out when I used FTP that revealed that it was actually putting into a folder. Only way I could ensure my drag and drop was not being placed in a new sub folder was to use the FTP.

Having a dedicated tab for manual backups is awesome. Upgrading the modpack version when there was a new update was a little finicky, as access to server files is handled through menus rather than an actual folder you can just browse and drag through; altered files need to be reuploaded which can take some time, but that's really the only gripe I have\u2013and even then it's not a huge problem.

I did notice a plugin to view resource usage on your site but after installing the plugin my server continually crashed on startup and I had to restore it to an old backup.  We didn't lose any progress but I found the entire experience frustrating and wish usage stats were automatically tracked, not locked behind selectively functional plugins.Overall I am happy with my experience using Bisect, It is comparable to Apex in every way except the usage stat readouts.  However, since all else is equal this one issue does mean I would go back to Apex given the option.  I remain here because you have a wider offering of mod packs.  If/when we move to another pack that Apex does offer I would return unless the stats are added/fixed."

Please thank Thomas P for me, he is a GREAT operator for getting the attention of the plugin-creator for me so I could fix it with the creator himself!Thomas even told me about the Discord that I could watch for answers after he created a support tab in the Discord server of the plugin's creator, so the use of Discord is great with you guys it seems, which is very important these days, and it's nice to know that I'm not the only one that uses Discord, mainly to know that a company such as you guys use it, as it's not often i have seen that :DThank you SO much Thomas P, you are incredible for getting me the help i needed.Have a lovely christmas and new-year-Diamon"

          "Contenu": "I've been using different server services a while. I've had Minecraft since it was in Alpha 1.7.3 and still occasionally come back to it. I've run my own server out of an old machine I threw linux on, and had a lot more success there than with previous subscription servers so I stopped using them for a while. Me and my friends wanted to do a modded run this time, and after failing to build our own little vanilla+ pack for it, we quickly switched to BMC4, adding a couple mods. We found that BMC4, much like many other premade packs, simply doesn't work immediately when you drop it on a forge server. There's something the authors forgot, perhaps, or the version is out of date, or whatever the case, we quickly ran into headache, and this being short notice, I didn't have the time or medicine to suppress the inevitable migraine, so we went and purchased a server off BisectHosting. We weighed our options of servers and our pings and picked a budget server that fit what we needed better than available Permium servers.So far so good. The service gives full access to the files of the server without needing and FTP app open and connecting. You can simply drag and drop like most modern websites (I wanna guess React was used but I've not looked at any of the web code and likely won't bother to) and quickly situates the files correctly. Every mod pack you could want to run is preset and working, the service loads it all up and runs the server instantly, letting you get right to playing without any hassle. Whole packs and individual mods both are super easy to change and reinstall with different versions, right inside the gui of the website.It's a bit on the expensive side, even with a discount code on the first month, but the service is 100% worth it. I haven't had a single issue server side that wasn't user error. That's incredible, I remember a number of other services having server lag at weird intervals, and I can safely say I haven't seen anything of the sort running with 4 people on at once. We anticipated more and so have paid a little more for the extra power/space, but it likely isn't the only reason this service runs so smooth.The layout is a little wonky, but once I figured out everything was all set and I could manage the server with ease all while playing on it as well. 10/10 would recommend, they're hands down the best option for Minecraft gamers if any type."

The CurseForge modpack selection is far wider than many other server hosting websites. I would definitely recommend Bisect to anyone who asks what server hosting company to use."
