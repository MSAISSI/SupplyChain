          "Contenu": "Can you imagine dealing with a company where it's impossible to successfully do upgrades? In order to an upgrade you have to go on their web site that assumes what region of the world you're in. You can't change it! That means that if I live in England but ON1 thinks I live in Italy, I will be charged in Euros and not pound sterling. What could be stupider than that? Well, there's more. When I finally did an upgrade, I used a different email address than I used when I bought previous versions of their software. Because of that I was unable to use the software that I downloaded. There is no way of telling them to change the purchase to a different email. If I try to it, it says that the email is already being used. What about customer service? There is none. The only way of contacting them is through a \"Submit a request\" form. When I detailed my frustration including the invoice number, it responded by a bot that gave me an inane suggestion. There is no phone number and no way to speak to a human. I still am unable to use their software. If you have nothing else to with your time, buy their software otherwise don't bother.My update issue was finally resolved several days later! Now all they have to do is fix the region issue. They told me that when you get to the the pay for order page there is some way of changing the region. It is too late. It should be an immediate option like the language option."

And my pics are in JPEG .Also, although there are features improvements from the 2022 s/w that I already own, however herein are some areas that I hope ON1 can improve,1) the crop extension with the fill in the blanks, it not accurate, meaning I still need to touch it up there after.2) I like to have the focus stack & pano stitch functions3) the effects tab are generally antique, as in Luminar , the sun rays are moveable and Luminar Magiclight is able to capture multiple light points altogether , while in ON1 I have to individually add on those effects.Hopefully the June updates have justifiable improvements, otherwise I might have to get a refund and continue with Luminar NEO. Many thanks.RgdsOngToni"

Video tutorials are only partially helpful, as the videos don\u2019t actually show you how to edit an image from start to finish, the Keyword AI isn\u2019t helpful as it\u2019s not picking up anything in my 1000 images other than \u2018high key\u2019 and\u2026there\u2019s no face or people detection?

First, I didn't work at all, always crashed, etc. I divided the photos in to 10 Folder to edit them better, but to my surprise this doesn't really work either. If you want to sync your edits (and I only did small edits) it's gonna be impossible with more than 10 photos.If you want to edit not more than 100 Raw photos you're going to be satisfied, everything over 100 raws and the software is unusable (it's literally unusable I just want to point out what the limits of the software are) If I knew that I would've never bought it, but here we are..."

Make a purchase, use the software, everything was great. But over time they kept trying to do more.. They were never \"the best\" at anything, but they kept adding more tools and features and tried to be a replacement for Photoshop or Lightroom rather than just a plugin. This, over time, created a slower and less-performing program than the earlier releases (which I loved).Over time, they shut down their authentication servers (so no older versions of the software could be reactivated if you had a new computer or fresh install). They replaced these legacy versions with a newer version which again ran slower and worse than earlier versions. It also did not work at all on any Mac computers. The solution: Buy the new versionSo I did. And now rather than a base application and plugins, everything is split into multiple purchases. Buy twice. So I did. And again with updated, the plugins continue to run poorly even on a powerful editing desktop. Customer service has been terrible. I assume their response to this will be \"Submit a ticket!\", which is pointless. I've tried, I've purchased and re-purchased and then repurchased again (not learning my lesson) and nothing ever gets fixed.Despite buying, I constantly get bombarded with their \"Best sale.. EVER!\" emails every day. For someone who just bought the software, I don't need 3 emails a week telling me to purchase it. I've unsubscribed but continue to receive them.Don't bother. Look at Luminar, Topaz or even Nik instead."

Photo Raw Max will not allow imports from Lightroom to open as layers in On1 anymore and is the prime reason I leave Lightroom to go to ON1.  I find the interface is more complex than it needs to be.  AI masking really only handles the simplest of images and I nearly always have to go back to the brush. The brushing, if complex, hangs and becomes jerky after numerous brush strokes.  So, lots of room for improvement and Lightroom will remain at the heart of my workflow."

Before purchasing something of this liking I prefer to see real life examples of the software, including menus, tools, and how to.  There is not much on You tube (from you as a company) with these examples either. The one for noise is years old, and not informative.  It leaves a lot of your customers wondering and digging for information on how to get all the tools to show, the top menu is locked out when using in PS or LR, but yet no one explains this in the videos you have. Making a user dig for this information is not a plus. I have been in photography and graphic design for over 14 years, and found this confusing, I can bet there are more users feeling the same. There are other software providers that go more in depth and have that information up front and visible, hence my 3 stars instead of 5."

On1 is getting better,  but the interface is still a bit cumbersome,  especially when using brushes.  The effects module is a bit awkward and i usually don't use it. The perfect software would be Luminar Neo editing interface with On1 file management."

The reason I did not change to 5 stars is because of the experience I initially had with tech support and how they handled the situation with a \"too bad\" attitude.  The tech support rep didn't seem to care about resolving the actual issue to keep a long time customer.  A poor review shouldn't be the reason to make things right, when it could have been handled before a review was even posted.ORIGINAL REVIEW-Had started using ON1 Photo and ON1 Photo Raw in its beta days (2016).  Liked this software and decided to purchase it.  It had been great for me,  until the company decided to deactivate/expire my license in order to force me to upgrade to new version.  The version I was using met all of my photography needs, I did not see a need to upgrade.  Contacted support with absolutely no help, basically told me I qualify for a discounted upgrade price.   This is how they treat longtime customers."

ISSUES:  Speed of loading -- slow.  It takes too long to load.  It uses too much memory and too much of the CPU and using 4G memory.  Task Manager is pegged out!  And I have a Win10, I7 system.   Power usage Very High, Memory - 4G!  I think it is wasting time in scanning folders -- so what ever, make it only respond when I need it to.  Making a change in the picture and preview -- TOO SLOW.  I hit several buttons to change the photo and it takes forever!  And I actually locked it up. Had to try to close and reopen and it too forever to actually get the WIN 10 system to respond normally.   ALSO -- DAMN-- File Menu:  PLEASE ADD a simple CLOSE File and SAVE AS when I am done to conform with standard WIN menu.   I finished the editing and couldn't figure out how to simply save to a different folder -- I used \"EXPORT\" -- why can't I find the option \"SAVE AS\"?  And then CLOSE the file I was editing?  I was never able to actually close the file I was editing.  I like the capabilities, but..... incorporate some of the standard menu options.  In my opinion, you need to incorporate the usual expectations in the menu options and really improve on the speed.  I. e. don't make the program appear to be scanning my computer and wasting my time waiting for it to load and make it available for actually doing the work. Ass I learn the system, I am sure I will have more issues!"

          "Contenu": "I bought the Plug-in bundle.  However, I thought I was buying ON1's 2023 software BUNDLED with the Plug-ins.  In fact when I first contacted ON1's technical help, the helper (Stevie) did NOT advise me differently - He gave me instructions about how to get rid of the error -4.  He replied to my help request within 24hrs. However, when I replied to Stevie again (several times), he did not respond for 6 (six) days.  I had sent notes about my \"discoveries\" as I spent many hours trying to install it.  He finally replied (6 days later) and advised me that I had NOT purchased \"ON1 Photo Raw 2023.5\"!  Well, that solved the issue!  Since I could not use the plug-ins with my version of Photoshop, I requested a refund and it has been issued by ON1.  I quoted my contract # ID: ON1230801-4113-39716 on the first line of my first ask for help.  If Stevie had looked this up, the issue would have been immediately resolved.  However, why was I confused in the first place?  Well, I saw the word \"Bundle\" on ON1's \"sales\" promotion page and I thought, \"Great!  I can buy the whole package!\"  But, as the page told me, \"I gotta do it today to get the sale price.\"  So I did.  I recommend making the page less confusing unless the confusion is your intent.  I recommend a promotion that says, \"Download a free trial of ON1 2023 and IF you purchase the software within the trial period, you can purchase the Plug-in bundle for 50% off!\"   I also recommend that helpers check the customer's contract before proceeding with any help!!  I wish you success in your business.  I did try the ON1 Raw 2023 software in the free trial.  Unfortunately the file extensions were not recognized.  However, the main issue was that I could not figure our how to \"save\" my adjusted photos!  Why is that so difficult?  In Photoshop it is just under file/save or save as.  Thanks for the refund.

Recently the market picked up and I needed to put it to work. Keeping in mind that I already own 3 other pro-software editing packages, I like the navigation and the features and took the plunge for the most expensive editing software I ever paid for figuring for the beter... now wrong!That all said, for those in the real estate side know that photos, at least on the east coast, have to be uploaded by the real estate agents to MLS PIN, which is the lsiting service for at least 3 or 4 states in this area. They are not seen by the prospect if you don't.Bottom line, there is some sort of glitch in the software that MLS PIN catches and rejects the uploaded .JPG photos. The problem stems from the On1 Photo RAW output file. These images are in .JPG for this service. It makes no difference the title number of characters, the long edge pixel count or the dpi or any combination of! I almost lost several clients due to this. The kicker when I went back to my other software, I was able to load all the images to MLS specifications and even exceeded the limits 250% without any issue or rejection!There is no chat, no phone, and no answering emails. In other words, no customer or technical service. I sent two emails and marked them urgent...So what!  Lost over $250 for the stuff I bought including the 2022.1 version of their elite software. Suggestion: look somewhere else.As an update 04/05/2023, although I love the software otherwise, it is not conducive to the New England MLS for real estate which in itself is strange. However, using other software (three in all) for the same purpose has no issues. The problem continues to point to ON1 with no resolution to date."

          "Contenu": "I have used ON1 software as far back as ver. 10.5.  I usually upgrade every few years.  The last upgrade was to PhotoRaw 2021. Given all the advances, I decided to upgrade to 2024.  Since I have an older computer (2010, HP 170t), I tried the one month trial of  PhotoRaw 2023.  It worked well, so I decided to upgrade to 2024 hoping that it too would work on my old computer.  At the end of the install process, I received an error message saying that my version of DirectX 12 was not compatible.  Surprisingly, though, it appeared on my desktop and I tried it.  Although I really like the new interface, the Brilliant AI did not work, nor did some of the masking features.  Also, I noticed that my older processor was constantly ramping up to warp speed, as should be expected given some of the new features of AI.  So, I have installed 2023 and am going to use that version until I upgrade my computer, which I am dreading, not so much for the expense, but for the labor in transferring, installing, etc.  So, once I get established on the new computer, I will do a more thorough review.  I am an amateur photographer who enjoys editing digital photos, but who is also digitizing a large slide and color negative collection.  I would like to suggest that some information, or perhaps videos on how PhotoRaw could be utilized to accomplish this endeavor would be useful.  I believe ON1's emphasis on customers' needs is paramount in its growing base of users.  As a former resident of the Portland area (only about 5 miles from your office) I wish you well.Michael WallDavisburg, Michigan"

Images generated from RAW for editing on the screen looks not sharp (maybe because on1 wants to increase speed and responsiveness of user interface). Some Effects tools particularly double each other, like for example color adjustments. I would like to see mask intersection and subtraction options. I need possibly to create mask based on color and tone simultaneously in combination with gradient and brush tools. Album function, not as flexible as collections in Lightroom. So, as a conclusion, on1 should work on basic functionality and tools quality and consistency."

But is\u2019t not obvious, to do so, and the Portrait AI, doesn\u2019t seem to be dedicated for changing the background ;o(, until now, I\u2019m using Photoshop CS6 to do so.Also note that ON1 Photo Raw 2023 is compatible with Photoshop CS6, the plugins are all included in : PS6 File/Automate and also in PS6 Filter/ON1To conclude:- Hope that the Portrait AI would include and easy way to swap backgrounds and allow an easy way to keep the subject hair into a new background ;o)- ON1 Photo Raw 2023 plus the individual plugins is a great improvement, compared to the older versions, especially version 2021 ;o)- I propose to all ON1 Users to upgrade to the latest version, and include the six plugins.Keep on your great work ;o)SamQu\u00e9bec City"

          "Contenu": "After trying out ON1 Photo Raw on a couple of occasions, I finally purchased version 2023.5 in late July 2023. It's not the only piece of photo asset managing and editing software I have and it is a matter of choosing the preferred tool for a particular job. A Swiss Army Knife may have a lot of attachments but sometimes, say, a specific screwdriver is needed.A really good feature of Raw 2023.5 is the development of raw files. I have both Nikon & Sony cameras and the developed output from NEF and ARW files is great. It's very easy to adjust the tonal rendering and the AI settings are a good starting place - sometimes nothing else is needed. That being said, the AI noise adjustments, particularly on high ISO files from the small sensor on the Sony, are less good and I prefer the classic method. (Another bit of software I have does it better without saying it is \"AI\" but the colour rendidtion is less pleasing!)On some tests, the focus stacking feature gave quite good \"out of the box\" results despite being limited to 15 images. On macro subjects I would normally take over 40 images so I would have to have a multi-stage process.I am not bowled over by the AI keyword feature but the auto look-up of location names from the GPS stamp saves a little bit of time.In summary, I will use Raw 2023.5 for development of raw images including various adjustments and colour grading. I do not intend to use it for managing my photo assets nor for more intricate adjustments such as blending several photos.If I didn't have the other software, I would be happy to use most of Raw 2023.5's rich features. It is good value for money."

While it doesn't offer EVERY feature that lightroom or photoshop does it's an interesting combination of both that provides enough functionality for the vast majority of photo-editing, even including some layering and masking abilities. In my time working with ON1 I've cataloged or edited about 10,000 photos without a problem. I've used the last two versions of ON1 and have noted significant improvements in functions and abilities from one to the next. Also ON1 uses less resources than lightroom making it perfect for those of us who don't have an M1 or M2 MacBook. (yet)they also offer free tutorials on using their project which is similar enough to adobe in front-end accessibility to make the transition quick.The only complaint I have is that sometimes, and I mean just that, not always, but sometimes the company does fall behind on customer service issues. But they have always gotten back to me."

I waited for the best price before I upgraded. I will say I own a few versions. 2018,2019,2020,2022 now 2023. It is nice that you do not have the annual fee like light room but to get any improvement you have to buy the next version. I owned light rm 6 and I received updates for a few years. This is 1 thing I do not see with ON1 very few if any upgrades to older versions. I still have glitches with ON1. Like when I want to just whip through the thumbnails to pick the photos I want to edit, sometimes it will take time to load the photo other times the photos load real quickly. I shoot raw 25 meg.  I have it set for quick view. I still am waiting for a factory lens correction for my Mavic mini pro 3 drone, those are DNG files. I have 1 made but not perfect. So it takes time to correct them. The auto AI masking is OK. But there are times (many) that I go to manual selecting because the AI picks large areas. Exporting images seem to be faster as well. I am using a MAC book Pro."

Stayed with it because of the easy to use indexing system and photo editing tools.  Dylan\u2019s and Dans instruction videos have helped me keep up with the advancements and newest tools. On1 360 is an excellent program and example of your constant efforts to stay ahead of this ever changing photography world.Keep on keeping on, you are doing great.Tom"

Please don\u2019t go to monthly charging. I enjoy the concept of ownership of the version you sign up for. The continuous development throughout the year and major update annually provides incentive enough to renew each year."

The convenience of final photographs with so advantages that usually take an infinite amount of time and then post editing with PhotoShop to add a few extra; layers to layers and the final touches of a genuine photograph are astounding. I will say that I have a unique photographic skill, one is simple snap shots as a child with a $6.00 Kodak Camera that I bought working at .25 an hour. (Lot of money in those days) and then moving to California to document my journey. While in California I had a total loss of identity because of family. An arms length transaction. In the meantime, I was partially professionally photographing Playboy Style Photography and then getting some nice photographs. As they say, a photographer is recognized for maybe 50 photographs if it goes to a gallery. (1/125 of a second is 250 photos right?) in my life, I have hundreds of photos some miserable and some very well composed. The clarity of a good lens and a nice camera offer total post-production. At 70 years of age, Photography is as good as the \"Wasteland\" by T. S. Eliot, and as they say \"A photograph is worth 1,000 words\". In contract space and a contract dollar, I leave the middle ages of a plague and enter the light of the western hemisphere. Something of the feelings of the great photographers and their helpers in the 1840s. Anyway, this program answers it all. Love wins it all. \"Beautiful Mind\" Russel Crowe + AI (Albert Einstein)"

And I reached out on a Saturday over the weekend. Now that's customer service ! I've been an ON1 user for nearly 10 years now, or just about since the company came to market here in the US, and have watched their amazing evolution of their product lines and love their program having now switched over to ON1 from my beloved Aperture v. 3 ( remember those guys ? ). To be honest I was reluctant ( fearful ? ) to let Aperture go as I used it for so long for my business but the latest iterations of 0N1 have made me forget Apples A3 quickly. If you are looking for a processing program to switch over to like I was, look no further. Not only is ON1 \"Everything\" simply amazing on every level I can now vouch for their customer service as being top notch and super responsive and for me that speaks volumes about the company and where they are taking it to theprofessional consumers like me. Thanks ON1 and bring on ON1 2024 \"Max\", can't hardly wait ! - Richard Meseroll -"
