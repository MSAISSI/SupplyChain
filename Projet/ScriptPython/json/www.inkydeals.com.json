The instructions for downloading the package indicate that introduction of my email and the serial code that will be received after the purchase is completed. The purchase has been made and collected, and the serial code has not been sent to me. I've claimed it from InkyDeals four times and never answered my mails. It's not the first purchase I make at InkyDeals and it's always worked well, this time it's been a mess. I preside an association of over 1300 photographers and if this is not resolved I am free to make the misbehavior public in this association.AtentmentJos\u00e9 Luis Cuendia \u201cGuendy\u201d"

So, nice to have them there, but it would have been nice to have been given a heads up several weeks earlier!So, the experience was frustrating, but it looks as though I still ended up with the downloads for which I\u2019d payed."
