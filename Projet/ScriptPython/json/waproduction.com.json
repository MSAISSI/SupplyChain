Though my assumption puts me slightly at fault, since the software compatibility is listed on the website.I (and I suspect most people) would assume that a working demo, indicates a working, compatible piece of software. Otherwise, WHAT\u2019S THE POINT IN THE DEMO?! A COMPLETELY MISLEADING PIECE OF SOFTWARE IF IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY REPRESENT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE ACTUAL PLUGIN.This is really unacceptable. Misrepresentation of the product and clearly leads to enough confusion that there is a FAQ section on their own website about the issue. It\u2019s presumably related to the serial number authorisation not working correctly.Again though, if the demo works, it is absolutely unacceptable for the purchased software to not also work.I WOULD RECOMMEND AVOIDING ANY COMPANY THAT MISREPRESENTS THEIR SOFTWARE WITH DEMOS THAT DON\u2019T REPRESENT THE COMPATIBILITY OF FINAL PRODUCT."

Other than that, it was not really worth buying it. Future House 10 for 10 is much better than Bass House pack. It contains much more materials I can use in my projects. No bass house 10 for 10 tho. Nevertheless, thanks for providing us this service.p.s. I wasn't even able to get the pack right away due to the unknown error, so I mailed them, but needed to wait for their response for more than 2 days. Pretty inconvenient experience and thought I needed to mention this downside too."

It doesn't make my workflow easier/faster or the sound I'm applying it to better in any way. Very disappointing.

Can't fault them in that regard - you get what is advertised.What I don't like is the annoying copy protection - you get a total of 3 activations. No way to free up activations on your own. That's a very short lifespan if you have more than one machine and/or semi-regularly upgrade your rig. You need to send an email asking for more activations when you've used them up. Sure, they granted me additional activations, but it's a horrid system and really needs to be revised to allow you to free up activations without being beholden to the company. It'd also reduce support overheads, which would be win-win.Trying to download Halo 2 Lite for free was a convoluted nightmare. After completing the checkout process, you get a PDF that redirects you to another site where the lite version is hidden/buried and really hard to find (which isn't just W.A. Production's fault, but they could have linked you straight to the product). It shouldn't take 10 minutes to download a freebie.So the plugins themselves are fine, but the user experience regarding downloading, authorisation etc. is not good.Edit: As to the reply, if you really care that much about your ratings, then improve the copy protection in your existing products. Until then, all the issues still exist, so I'm not going to change the rating. A pleading reply does nothing to address the frustrations that this has caused and will continue to cause. As a *paying user*, I shouldn't be the one who has to deal with the hassle of copy protection. You've got this one backwards. Also, a rating of 3/5 is hardly terrible. It means, \"OK, but could do better\". Do better, and you'll get a better review, that's how reviews work!"

Hire a few and open yourself up to modern sound ie: soul, funk, deep gospel, blues, jazz, neo soul, and carribean sound sets. Hope this helps, will watch this space!Resp. Thanks for your reply, I hope in the future that you be open to broaden your horizons, and elevate your sound sets with the aforementioned genres.

Going through the presets is pretty slow as I'm not able to click up and toggle through the whole list at once. But overall, I think the purchase was worth it as this price and I'm looking forward to implement and experiment with several of the plugins in my future projects./Alex"

It's clear that many comments on TP are made up (you just have read some, pick a massively overpriced item and check the comments), and I have witnessed negative comments that were later deleted, which gives a very biased, completely unreliable, and untrustworthy service. It's a totally unreliable platform, so anyone using it is either aware that it's flakey and doesn't care about misleading people, or are so inept they don't realise TP cannot be trusted. My take away is if you use TP then I can't rate or recommend you - but you prob don't care, and this comment will prob get deleted.(edited because there's no option for me to respond to replies)"

Your UI needs an intuative upgrade.I also don't agree that it is CLEARLY described. It should appear as warning before purchase instead of small print to avoid confusion - because there clearly is a LOT of confusion. Secondly, the demo works fine on older updates, which leads me to believe that it is your security system that is not compatible, which I think is a poor priority as a customer. I understand that you are a for-profit company as you mention in other reviews - however you won't get any profit at all if your customers go to better services for their plugins.I also think that you should spend more time listening to your many complaints as I am sensing a passive aggressive tone throughout your replies here.If you ask for reviews, then you'll get honest reviews and your service has a lot of room for improvement. I ended up buying another plugin, which took me 20 seconds to purchase, download and install.Mutant delay looked great - shame I never got to try it - I recommend to all other customers that you instead opt to purchase Dynamic Delay from Initial Audio.second reply:So they ended up giving me a workaround for my computer, which worked. Still not a great experience, but atleast I got the plugin. Changed my rating from 2 to 3."

The easiest way for me to rate this is to make a list of pros/cons and features I would have liked because there are lots of very good qualities to this product but also many average and poor.  So here goes:ProsProbably the most important feature is the quality of the samples both in terms of useable content and audio purity.Reasonable subscription rates starting from about \u00a310 a month.A reasonable amount of free downloadable sample packs that just because they are free it doesn't mean they are of any lower quality.ConsIt is still very early days for W. A. Production's subscription plans so only a limited amount of their total sample catalogue is available as part of the subscription plan without having to pay further.No facility to view and preview samples from a particular product.  In the past we have all spent reasonable amounts of money buying sample CDs only to find that either very little is new or useable content, so a good preview is very important.Very little content outside of the EDM genre.ConclusionsThere are a number of competitors coming into this subscription service scheme, like Loopmasters and Splice to name but two so I think W. A. Productions will have to work very quick in order to not get swept away by these as these others offer previews of individual samples from products and the ability to purchase individual samples so you don't have to buy a whole sample pack just to get a couple of desired samples.With more development I think this could be a very good site, but they must be quick so as not to get left behind which would be a shame."

          "Contenu": "Website design: confusingProducts: Ideas are innovative and unique and stay up to date which is good but lacking enough presets.Value: Cheap products which can be good or bad if you're looking for premium quality in all their products. Kind of like Waves products. hit and missPros: Alot of good quality freebie sounds, serum patches, and the free Combear plugin (very nice plugin). Also its nice to have a company stay up to date and actually try to release new content even if its not the best. For example Omnisphere takes for ever to update new stuff and things like Trillian become outdated and imo Omnisphere is as well. Not to say WAproductions is replacing any premium suites like this but I would say WAP is EDM/Future Bass focused which is a good thing.Cons: Its easy to drop money on premium content you know that doesnt go on sale and will deliver quality sound like Serum/Omnisphere are quality purchases. These plugins are hit and miss and for regularly priced $60 plugins totally not worth it. Now for a sale of $5 probably is but until you learn more about the tool your using enough to make a Pro Upgrade Choice. I recently just reached out to them of a semi issue on my order and they didn't do anything to resolve the issue but just made sure I was aware of their policy. When a customer reaches out to a company they are not looking for policy they are looking for a reason to like the product. I see WAP is active in keeping replies to reviews which shows promise is customer satisfaction but falls short in my opinion of hitting their target market: hobbyists! So this is why they are 3 stars to me. Try their products. Their Demos are crippled making them very frustrating to try out but it might give you an idea if you like it or not. This BF I bought a ton of their plugins and have yet to find anything as useful as Combbear. Pumper 2 looks promising but wasn't on sale unfortunately. I'm rooting for this company. We need more competition and innovation and collaboration in this industry. But for as much Customer Feedback this company tries to please I'm not sure they are actually listening to their clientele. I think most businesses fall into this trap though not realizing investment is a two way street."

The loops can be interesting for a type of music, and they are very good loops with lots of variety.But at the end, it's with no doubt a very good product, for sure."

The only options are to purchase and install a plugin to manage midi routing such as Blue Cat's Patchwork, or to drag and drop the midi clips generated onto the individual tracks on the DAW.It could also do with a comprehensive written manual althughthere are some good viseos on You Tube.Having said this I will reiteate it generates some really good midi output."

Sometimes the giveaways are great and other times they are boring and just take up space. But can't complain about free, right? Their own plugins are hit or miss: some are not amazing, whereas others are so great you don't know how you did anything before them - depends on your needs I guess. Navigating the shop is confusing sometimes, but overall pretty organized. (I mainly just go for sales, anyway.) Overall, a solid good experience."

I found it a bit difficult to navigate and there are a several side tab like pop ups that require a mouse click to hide so you can properly see the information you are really trying to view.  There is a ton of content on the site which is great, I just wish it was perhaps a bit better organized and easier to navigate with fewer pop up menus that multiple layers deep.That's a minor complaint however and over all I'm really pleased with my purchase.

And from time to time they have very good sales when you can buy high quality samples, plugins, presets and templates at affordable prices. They are first in my thoughts when I\u2019m thinking about samples and presets. Also what I love about WA Plugins is that you don\u2019t have to install some plugin manager or license management tool and every plugin has a lot of presets to play with. Thanks WA Production! I\u2019ve learned a lot from FLP Templates and from video courses! But wait, there\u2019s more: Their YouTube and Facebook is full of awesome tips and tricks!"

The user interface is well laid out but you will need to read the quick guide a few times to get comfortable with it and to understand what it\u2019s doing.  What is offers is great to spark the idea.  In my workflow I use instacomposer to rough out some idea of melody rhythm pad bead etc. then dog drop them into my DAW as editing inside the plug-in is just too finicky. In the DAW I have better control and can play around with the sounds and notes.  If it doesn\u2019t flesh out then I jump back into instaccomposer and try a different combo.   It\u2019s not the most elegant or efficient but it works and we are in this to make music."
