          "Contenu": "Our company used Bangert to implement Sage software about 8 years ago before I took over my current position in the company. One of the responsibilities I have now is to manage our software, and I am not an IT professional at all. We were recently having an issue with Sage Paperless working correctly. I had contacted Sage about this, and we figured out that our license had expired. This had happened before I had taken over. I fortunately remembered that Bangert had helped us implement Sage software and reached out to them. Hillary and Brett in the support department got involved and figured out what was needed, and who I needed to contact to get everything working correctly. They spent time and effort on this even though ultimately there was no fee involved in it for Bangert. They did this because it seems that they are dedicated to making sure customers (even ones from years ago) have a good experience with the software that they purchase through them. Without them we would still be having issues with our software, and no idea how to fix it. I could not recommend Bangert more highly for this, and will continue to recommend them to anyone who is looking to implement new software for their company."
