          "Contenu": "Inadvertently ordered two of the wrong toner cartridges.  Per the return policy, I emailed Tonerprice to let them know that I had opened one of the packages and that I only learned of my mistake when the cartridge wouldn't fit in my printer.  The response I received from the company was that they would only accept the unopened package back for return and that I was stuck with the opened package because I had \"cut the seal\" on the box.  First, there was no seal on the box - you think they'd know their own product.  And second, the cartridge remains brand new and only needs to have the inner plastic resealed.  Given the nature of a service business like Tonerprice, you think they'd take the risk of accepting back the cartridge I opened in order to maintain me as a customer.  Well, I'm not going to return the cartridges, I'll try to sell them on ebay.  While they kept the proceeds of these 2 cartridge sales, they lost my business forever.  I think they're out more than the roughly $40 the two cartridges cost in lost sales.  Great job, guys - way to cut customer service in the name of really-short-term cost savings.  It will be great never doing business with you again."

          "Contenu": "My Ricoh printer broke and I had to buy a new model, so I checked the Returns Page for tonerprice.com, followed all the requirements, and returned the Color PCU's I had purchased for $464.95. I returned an unopened product. In the product box. Within the timeframe. WITH a return authorization code. Now they are trying to tell me that because I did not have the FACTORY box (what the heck is that?) the best they can do is hold it for a very long time on consignment to try to resell for half price, and then give me half of that.  Which of course means 25% of what I paid. They even sent me a picture of what they received which SHOWS the product box! They later tried to tell me they didn't have the product box. They told me it was clear to them the product was unopened. They later tried to tell me it was \"damaged.\" So now they have lied twice about what they received, and the condition it was in, and the last I heard from \"Jody\" was that he or she had to leave for the day at 3 p.m. PST. Great. Will have to dispute with the credit card company. (When I first received the product, I wrote on the outside of the box what it was, i.e. \"color pcu for Ricoh....\" before I stored it in my closet. Now they are saying that \"damages\" the product.  Wow.) On another note, I had a full set+ of toner that I bought from Ink Technologies that was worth almost $300 that I returned to them. NOT. ONE. PROBLEM. They didn't even ding me for a \"restocking fee!\"  On to the next review for Ink Technologies (that will be 5 star!). Wow.  Just read their reply and they could not be more wrong in their description. Just another example of how deceitful and greedy they are.  I tried to put as much extra packaging around the unopened color PCU units as possible so they would not get damaged in shipping; those are the white bags he is referring to and the additional cardboard Box that I placed them in for protection.  The actual item is sealed shut, un opened, fully functional as well as brand new.  I guess if I was the only person to give them a one star review there might be some question as to the legitimacy."

          "Contenu": "I ordered toner 4 cartridges for my Samsung laser printer, \rModel #SCX-4623FW, 3 compatible non OEMs, Model # SA-MLT-D105L, and one Samsung OEM, Model #105L. The Samsung OEM came from the same location but in a separate shipment. While all of the non-OEMs were sealed in such a way that indicated the boxes they were in had never been opened, not so with the OEM. Not only was the box taped to hold it together after the zipper-like strip opener had obviously been \"unzipped\" and tossed by someone before me. And the interior air-filled protector had also been opened. While I can see no evidence on the cartridge itself that anyone had either used or attempted to load it into a printer, it was still apparently a restocked item. Nothing was said on the website about restocked items, information quite common to such entities as Crutchfield, Best Buy, and Office Max/Depot. Though this item was discounted online and I was able to use a coupon code to further reduce the cost of the items, I would suggest that the least that could have done by Tonerprice when the OEM was returned to them would have been to reseal the interior air-filled protector to ensure the cartridge wouldn't be adversely affected by exposure to the air; after that, a simple disclaimer that these products might be restocked items would be a fine addition to the description. I'm just installing the cartridge today, as the one currently installed is indicating that it's almost empty, so at this point I cannot say for sure that there's anything wrong with this product; time will tell rather quickly, I assume.\r I must say, though, that the prices I paid were quite reasonable, even compared to other internet sites I've used before to purchase ink, the added discount was and the shipping time was really fast; I placed my order on the evening of 12/31/15  and received the non OEMs the following Wednesday, 1/6/15, the OEM the following day. And the shipping was FREE! Thank you, Tonerprice, for that, but you need to practice a more transparent \"truth-in-sales\". I've been an online ink purchaser for over 8 years, this was the first time I've ordered from Tonerprice. I plan to order from you again in the future."

The drop-down menus on the website made it easy to find the toner that I needed without having a whole lot of information about the copier that I needed it for. That is super helpful. Shipping was super fast. Love that! I can\u2019t speak to the integrity of the toner or the link that it last just yet as this is my first order from this company but I will post an updated review when we are to that point. As of right now, I will definitely be purchasing again from this company."

We ordered a complete \"aftermarket\" toner package for our copier Unfortunately the toner cartridges wouldn't work with our copier. They sent us two more different cartridges for free and they didn't work either. I didn't want to spend the money on factory toner for our older machine so we opted to purchase a newer copier. The upside is that Jody at Tonerprice.com was AWESOME in her attempts to help us in every way possible. Tonerprice.com will be my first stop the next time we need toner."

While I was ordering there was a $ 10 promotion and if your order is more than $125 then the shipping will be free. So order two toners because I want to make sure to have other color spare toners in back stock.  Since I never used tonerprice.com, I was not sure if I will even get the stuff I am ordering.  BUT..\r As soon as I order completed, I received a confirmations through email for my order and  payments, since i placed the order on Saturday, I received fedex shipment information on Monday, on Thursday I received a big box with my two toners.\r When I open the black toner, one of the lever is broken, when I instal the toner in the toner comportment it fixed well and I did a test printing and printed ok.  Instead of returning or even to call them to let them know I started to work on it ad it is printing well.  If I have any problem because of the broken lever then this will be my last order otherwise I will keep tonerprice .com as my toner supplier.  I am satisfied with the entire process and I am recommending toner service to my other business friends as well.   Thank you tonerprice team."
