I noticed that Verizon and Nomad used the same local carrier, so I have no clue why Nomad\u2019s eSIM didn\u2019t work. I followed the recommendations to turn Airplane mode on and off, reboot my phone, etc., and finally gave up and just stayed with my Verizon plan. I landed in Hong Kong yesterday and the same thing happened. I got service for about five minutes, then completely failed, so it looks like my experiment with Nomad is a one-and-done."

Have wasted so much time trying to use very basic functions on the internet with this terrible reception. Would not recommend. Even if you get a relatively large data pack (20GB in my case) there is just no way you could ever use it up with these slow speeds and bad reception."

We couldn\u2019t use TikTok, prices would show up in Hong Kong Yuen, several sites wouldn\u2019t provide us access saying they were not providing access to Hong Kong. While the data was working relatively consistently in major cities, as soon as we exited a major metropolitan area the speed and quality of the connection dropped drastically, sometimes not working at all. For about 80% of the trip our iMessage was not working. Unsure why but it seemed to be related to the Hong Kong aspect mentioned above. We were also unable to message each other with iMessage the entire time after we left NYC (21 days) and had to use other solutions. Lastly, and this is simply a reminder to myself and word of caution to other travelers, we opted to only get a data plan without a phone number to save money and that was a mistake. We NEEDED to call places several times and simply couldn\u2019t, which caused delays and complications on our trip. So, unfortunately I cannot recommend this service."

They never mentioned anything about a refund in an email to me.  (They have given me a refund now).  Hard for me to respond for a refund when they didn't offer.2. Nomad had asked me to email the support with my order number to investigate, that is what I did, so that is sending a ticket in my opinion.  If there was some other way for me to submit a ticket, nomad never provided that information to me in the reply.It seems nomad is trying to make it look like I didn't contact them correctly, and that I didn't respond to a question when in fact, I did what they asked in emailing about the issue, and they never asked me about getting a refund when they sent me the $3 off next purchase email.Pretty poor customer service in my opinion."

          "Contenu": "I used Nomad for a recent trip to the UK (London) and El Salvador. In the UK, everything worked great \u2013\u00a0I had no problems with my UK plan and a solid connection everywhere you would expect to.Things were very different in El Salvador. The plan details for this eSIM clearly said I could expect \"4G/LTE\" speeds. However, once I activated the plan, the plan details in the Nomad app said \"Speed: 3G\". Sure enough, I could only get a 3G network connection, which was next to unusable. I also had my existing Verizon plan active on the phone, and had LTE coverage on that SIM almost everywhere in El Salvador, on the exact same network (Movistar) as the Nomad eSIM. It is clear that I was sold a 3G only plan by Nomad, since their eSIM would not connect at anything over 3G while I had full bars of LTE on another SIM on the same phone at the same time in the same location. I can see from other reviews here that I am not the first person to experience this exact issue using a Nomad eSIM in El Salvador.But the real problem here? Nomad's support. I outlined all this to Nomad via the app multiple times, and the support team was like a broken record. There were constant requests to update my data settings, screenshot my data settings, reboot my phone (even when I had already just done all of this multiple times), and an insistence that I was receiving 3G speeds because of the geographical location I was in and that it must be because the location only had 3G coverage (clearly not the case, given I had 4G on my Verizon SIM on the same phone). Every time I contacted support to let them know I still wasn't connected to 4G, they would message me something like \"we see that your usage has gone up 50MB so it looks like your data is working\", to which I repeatedly had to explain that I had never said I didn't have working 3G data, just that I could not connect to the 4G network as promised.I lost count of the times I had to repeat myself, change my settings, restart my phone \u2013 eventually I gave up, because 3 days into my 5-day trip I had spent more than enough time and energy trying to get my Nomad eSIM working as advertised. Horrendously frustrating experience, and at literally no point during my many, many messages with support did I feel like they could understand the problem or help me with it. They seemed completely incapable of going off-script, and frustratingly their script had very little to do with the problem I was experiencing.I ended up buying another travel eSIM from Maya, which worked perfectly, was significantly cheaper, and gave me the 4G speeds I was expecting (on the same phone and same network as the Nomad eSIM, nonetheless).Ultimately, I paid for a 4G plan and not once was connected to 4G, and there was nothing resembling an offer of a refund (even a pro-rated one, given that I did use SOME data on 3G).5 stars for the flawless service in London.1 star for the service in El Salvador.1 star for the support."

However during certain times on our trips, we would run into slow speeds from the connectivity to a point where nothing loads on our phones. This has caused frustration as we rely on apps such as Google Maps for navigation and other apps for Parking. One thing to point is that this doesn't happen all the time but at random times during the day and it would be consistent with all of the other phones that are using Nomad within our group. I really hope Nomad will work on maintaining the stability of their network speeds as this app is too useful to be malfunctioning."

Be sure to ask for the country specific networks in advance and know you may need to reset up the APN as you travel between countries."

Video calls connect ok, but freeze every few seconds. Downloads are slow and in some cases they just stop as if they don't work. Even with this SIM card I was constantly looking for wifi. I would happily pay more for a faster more stable connection, but this is the only option. It's disappointing given everything else about my experience with NOMAD is positive."

We followed the instructions on the Nomad app to resolve it, but nothing worked.2) Otherwise, there were a few instances of performance issues (poor responsiveness), but those were resolved when I turned off my phone and turned it back on.3) No warning from Nomad that we were about to run out of data so we could buy more - which they acknowledge, but this needs to change. In our example, the only option was to pay our primary provider\u2019s ridiculous roaming fees to get back online since we were driving and nowhere near wifi).None of the issues we had outweighed how much money we saved avoiding Bell\u2019s outrageously expensive daily roaming fees - so as I said, I\u2019d use them again."

We both have Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G smart phones.I do not know much about esims so it did take me more time than necessary, even though I followed instructions. I was able to work out what the instructions meant in the end. The instructions could have been a little clearer with regard to turning on esim for mobile data. I had to read in between the lines a bit.The activation step could also have been clearer. I turned on the esim just before I left home (while I had access to wifi. Very important to have wifi). When I landed in Japan the esim connected to the Internet and I was able use social media apps, WhatsApp and Messenger  use Google Maps etc.Coverage was excellent. Internet speed was very good. Two more days left in our 20-day trip we both each still have 8GB of data available. We got the 10GB plan to be on the safe side. It was the smallest plan. Nomad was recommended to me by my daughter. I have no hesitation recommending this esim (for Japan at least)."
