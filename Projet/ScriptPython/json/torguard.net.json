          "Titre": "Shady billing & support - Effe' Torguard!",
          "Contenu": "I had the service for nearly 10 years and found that recently that I had been double billed.  Jordan was helping (here's the ticket I was working from:  Ticket ID: 28956) and had promised to talk with mgmt to see what he could do about merging the accounts & possibly working out some kind of deal... Someone named Thomas from another shift got involved, refused to advocate to mgmt, refused to merge my accounts, offered me a $10 discount on 2 years of additional service on top of the year I was already paid thru, and when I said I'd pass, he cut my access the day before it was even supposed to expire.   All of my devices that were connected hit a brick wall which shutdown my house.  I still had another year of paid service on the other contract, but he also blocked my IP (which I assume also is working to block my MAC address when coming from another IP address).... To conclude, I have an account that's paid thru Decemeber of 2024 but i can't use it because this wanna-be-marketer-know-it-all-control-freak has taken over my account.  I'm posting about it on social media and gamer forums.  Effe' Torguard!"

During that extended period of time, I had multiple torrents running...Now guess who has my IP. Why? Because TorGuard decided to just disconnect.Lucky I'm in Canada, and the worst outcome is my internet provider refuses me service. This would still be fatal, as I own a business in a rural community with only one option for the internet (other than Starlink). But if this happened in the USA, I would literally be excreting cement blocks knowing that now my IP address had been captured. Why? Because TorGuard glitched."

This diminished the value of the service to me.-1 star for the wild fluctuations in speed across various sites and inability to maintain a connection to some.  I'm not talking about extremes like US vs Asia, I'm talking regional US sites like TX, GA, FL, NY and NJ.+1 for connection software, easy to use, lots of features+1 for offering access to so many sites worldwide and the cost if the service when everything works properly My overall impression however is that I'm going to try other services to see if I find one that is a better fit for me rather than continue with this one."

I ended up signing up with another service just to stream videos and my iptv service. My ISP provides me with a steady 400 down the Tor Guard nodes slow me down into the teens and low 20's while other vpn's consistently have me in the 50 to 150 range.

If ever the app is open but not active, all internet traffic is stopped. Sometimes after closing TorGuard my WiFi adapter craps itself completely, wont reconnect to wifi unless system reboot. After using for 4 years I would say TorGuard is slow, but does a good job overall for the discounted price of $30 USD/ year. Not terrible but not amazing either."

My one beef would be that the service seems aimed at the technically sophisticated. I am reasonably knowledgeable about the technology in general terms but lack ready understanding of some of the details. Some lower level documents in the help area explaining in general how TorGuard vpn works with explanations of some of the technical terms would be useful for me."

I do not have any experience with other VPN companies other than Torguard and can only rely on reviews on the Web and Youtube most of which are usually affiliates getting kick-backs from the respective companies that get the most favorable reviews. VPN service is very difficult to qualify as absolutely required. I use it exclusively for torrenting."

I prefer Wireguard, but I have also tried OpenConnect and both types of OpenVPN, and no matter the connection type or location, Torguard Always lags well behind the others in both download/upload speeds and ping (3 or 4 and occasionally 5 times longer ping times than the other Vpn's with the same server locations).  I use VPN connections on three very different Windows computers - Asus, Dell, & H.P. - all with hard-wired connections to my gigabit router. Torguard is just plain slow compared to some of the competition."

Cons: Log in interface (you have to click that round thing to log in) - it just is so confusing when I log in the first time and subsequent uses makes me disdain it. While browsing MSN feeds, it still showed stuff from my residing country instead of the country (a different) I had sign on to. There are problems with Kill Switch (Torguard auto expire due to inactivity but website and internet is still running). That log in interface is the straw that broke the camels back - so am changing provider."

I will say that over the years their tech support has proven to be far better then most. They are responsive and do their best to address issues very quickly. (Their answer to the slow speed was to try switching between openvpn and wireguard, however it made little difference).Nevertheless, they are much, much better then most and I will be continuing with them indefinitely."

The website can be confusing (although it has been made better since I've started using it, it's still not ideal.)2. Pricing is completely dependent on the use of 50% off coupon codes, while these codes are abundant and reusable, and they automatically apply for every renewal period, they shouldn't exist. This definitely negatively affects it on comparisons lists, and makes it annoying to recommend to other people, but it doesn't have any effect on me as a user after purchase."

          "Contenu": "I've been using TorGuard for about seven years and am very pleased with the service. It's not as easy to use as some other VPN services I've tried, but it works, and it works with torrents! The other services I used were easier because they don't support port forwarding, which I need for torrenting. Getting port forwarding up and keeping it running can be a chore now and then. Every year or two, I have had to switch VPN servers and reconfigure port forwarding, but the great thing is that TorGuard's tech support personnel have always been there for me. They've helped me with port forwarding configuration and even with torrent client configuration. They really know what they're doing, and I appreciate that. Thanks! Have a happy holiday!"
