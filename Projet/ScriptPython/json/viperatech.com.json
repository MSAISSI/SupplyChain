          "Contenu": "If I could give zero stars I would. We ordered a miner from this company and the manufacture was delayed - completely understand that is outside of their control. However, the way they handled that delay is unreal to me. I spent hours trying to get ahold of someone for updates across multiple days. When I would get updates it would be to tell me to be patient and that they couldn't give me a refund even though the item was delayed by almost a year. Finally, I found out they had the item, but hadn't bothered to ship it. Then arranging shipping took another 2 weeks of me calling. Their employees are rude and unhelpful and there is zero accountability if something goes wrong. Buy from a more reputable dealer. I also noticed that they like to claim bad reviews were paid for by a competitor or not actual customers. That's a cute trick."

I gave an honest review, you can rest assuredUpdate:The company claims that the parcel is at customs, but 3 weeks have already passed.

I was even proposed to replace the units that I have ordered (AMD-BC160) with lower grade units overpriced. For small orders you can gamble.Overall I lost money waiting instead of purchasing these from other suppliers."

Instead of refund I got a proposal for receiving lower grade units overpriced which I have declined. Finally I got the BC-160 but these are heavily used. Also I have asked for the warranty terms and still got no answer on that.Please consider these aspects on your next Viperatech purchase."

          "Contenu": "Is Viperatech a scam website?? I hope not. To the Vipera guy reading this here - my Order #7602 for an Nvidia GPU CMP170HX was placed on January 4, 2022, and until now, March 1, 2022, still undelivered. Nvidia CMP170HX seems to be a problem; they offered a swap at their website. I agreed to swap the Nvidia GPU with 3 AMD BC-160; am still waiting for the delivery.  I am crossing my fingers that they are not scammers.Update:  At the Viperatech website, as of today, March 5th, 2022: \"AMD XFX BC-160 74MH/s 150W1272 in stock\"Now, they are supposed to ship only 3X BC-160s to me to swap for the unfulfilled order of Nvidia 170HX GPU. And they have over a thousand of these AMD GPUs \"in stock\"!!Well, their latest promise through this Trustpilot.com website is March 9th delivery to me \"before noon\". Let's wait and see. And then I will amend further this review.Update #2:Vipera, through DHL, delivered the 3x AMD BC-160 last Monday, March 7th, 2 days ahead of the March 9th schedule. I appreciate it. The GPUs have been under test for a couple of days now and seem to be performing within my expectation. So, I'd say they are acceptable. Only one minor issue left - how they will handle the refund of the small difference between what I paid for my original order of Nvidia CMP-170HX and the current price of the AMD BC-160.Conclusion: Viperatech is a legitimate online commerce business. They just sorely need an improvement in their after-sale customer support and communication - better responsiveness and transparency."

          "Contenu": "I ordered an Intel i9-10980XE which Vipertech listed as in stock. The funds were deducted from my account right away and the problems pretty much started right away. I was told product would ship in 7 days days after order was placed, one said shipped DDP and another said I have to deal with customs. I did not receive my order until 22Aug23.I was told \" It is enroute but no tracking until it lands in your country.\" When I went to chat after 8 days I was told it was not shipped. Now bear it mind it more often than not took Viperatech days to reply to my questions regarding this order, asking for delivery status. After days of no replies I made a review explaining what my experience with Viperatech was like so far.Within and hour or 2 I started getting messages from Vipertech, here is the exchange:V: \"Management has informed us your order is being cancelled unless you change your 1 star trustpilot review.\"15/8/23 7:41Me;\" And how do I know if I delete my review my order will actually be shipped?\" 15/8/23 7:41V: \"Change it now, manager says, or they are cancelling the order is what we are told.VIPERA - 15/8/2023, 7:42Manager says this cpu was hard to find, we have paid for it from our partner in advanceWe will not fulfill your order if that review stands.Funds will be returned to you if it is not rectified.Furthermore, it was bought at a loss, $1300.Change it, or we cancel.You have 2 hours to rectify manager says. You can always put your review back up if it doesnt shipbut as it stands, they will not ship anything with that review up.\"Viperatech 15/8/23 7:43Now the thing about that exchange. I made the review on a Google account that is not registered with Viperatech. Another thing I would like to point out is where Viperatech in the above exchange said they paid more for the CPU and sold it to me at a loss. I checked Viperatech website for the CPU after that claim and the price went from $1,050 to $1,398. I checked the site again and it was back down to $1,050.Viperatech is not honest on what they have in stock, when/if it was shipped and are very, very slow to respond to customer questions/concerns. How would I describe my experience with Viperatech? Something between a dumpster fire and a nightmare."

Instead of the NEW blower style RTX 3090s that we ordered, we received REFURBISHED triple fan RTX 3090s. Again, we needed a specific form factor for our project, so these were useless to us. The weird thing was our order was placed for Gigabyte GPUs and our shipment came directly from MSI.1/11/2023 - Email informing Vipera of their mistake. Website shows they still have 7 units in stock of the GPU that we ordered. We asked them to ship out the correct GPUs and send a return label for the GPUs we received. - No response1/26/2023 - 2nd email informing them of the mistake and trying to rectify1/31/2023 - Finally get a response, they are now out of stock of the GPU that we originally ordered and it is discontinued. They \"recommended\" that we \"upgrade\" to a to a Quadro RTX A5000 and they would only charge us the difference in cost, and additional ~$2000. How generous.No way I would offer this company any more business. Now the real question is: how long will it take to get a return label and actually get a refund?This place is a joke. They are error prone and unresponsive. Shipping takes forever. I made the mistake of selecting this as a vendor for some critical parts of an engineering project. If you are a business or large corporation looking to source hardware, stay far away from this company.If you're okay waiting 76 days for delivery, with no tracking information, and needing to email them 3-4 times before you get an unhelpful response, then go ahead and order from them."

I sent an email to them asking for an update December 15th and received a quick response saying it would take a 2 business day delay from when you place the order until you receive tracking, and then it is scanned shortly afterwards by DHL. Also noted that they are shipping from Hong Kong, which I can understand since thats probably where they are made. As of Dec 18th I have not received a tracking ID or any updates. I will give them the benefit of the doubt that they are busy because of the holidays but I am still expecting a shipping label to be given to me for tracking today or tomorrow, or I will begin to be worried. I will update my review once I receive a tracking ID on my order, and will update once again if/once I have received my package.Edit 1.) Dec 19th still no update, shipping label or tracking id provided.Edit 2.) Dec 20th Got an email that tracking label will be scanned shortly and got the tracking label itself.Edit 3.)

My one grievance is that the quantities they show in stock don't seem to be accurate. They showed in stock on 10/18 but didn't actually end up getting stock for my order until 11/1. Overall, solid purchase experience. There isn't a lot of 3rd party info online about this company, but I hope this review helps convince people they are legit."

          "Contenu": "Update 2:Vipera credited $1,500 to the next order. I got a new tracking of the parts today (Apr 10) and it seems to be arriving this week. Update 1:Vipera agreed on $1,500 credit for the next purchase. There is a problem with the promo code they provided.Original Review:This review is for order #12992 brand new Bitmain Antminer 110t. I used $500 credit that I received from a previous order. I paid for a brand new price miner and received a used miner. I have been trying to resolve the issues with Vipera for over a month. They did not want to accept return/refund and kept twisting things around like a car salesman. I have been holding off writing a review, giving them enough chances. Viepra's dishonesty forced me to file an Amazon A-z claim and write this review. Vipera told me a few days after the order was placed that the brand new 110t was discontinued and would \"upgrade\" me to a cheaper 122t without refunding the difference. Even though the 122t is newer and more powerful, I refused it because the 122t's voltage is not compatible with my electricity. I asked them to cancel the order and refund. Vipera insisted that they would sort out a new 110t for me. At that time, there was refurbished 110t miners came out to the market. I asked them what they were sending. They confirmed that the one on the way was a brand new one. After waiting for 3 weeks, a badly used miner arrived. The shipping box had no Bitmain tape on it. I was shocked when I opened and tested it. The PSU is rusted everywhere that they had to sand it out. The SD card slot does not work. And, the worst was the longer shell with a fake 110t serial number sticker. The shell is an inch longer than the normal 110t and it wouldn't fit on my cooling rack. The miner is sitting there doing nothing for weeks while resolving issues with Viepra. I have lost the opportunity to mine for several hundred dollars. The used miner probably costs no more than $1,700 and I paid $3,200 for it -- a $1,500 difference.After letting Vipera know about the defects, they said they would send parts (I had to replace them myself). I did not get a confirmation of what they would send or any tracking number. There was no response from Vipera when I asked if they would send a replacement PSU. I had to go through Amazon to get a reply from them. On March 28, they said, \"A new PSU, control board and shell has already been dispatched to you\". Today, March 30, they gave me a DHL tracking. The tracking status is just \"Shipment information received on March 30\".I asked Vipera many times for a return/refund. I'm not going to pay a brand new price for a used miner even if everything is working with 1 year warranty. This used miner is about 2-3 years old and probably has only 1-2 years of life left. I still have to spend hours replacing and troubleshooting the broken parts. I gave them another option for a credit to keep the used miner and I would continue to do business with them with 2 more miners (brand new different model), but no response from Viepra. They only replied after I filed an A-z Amazon claim. They offered $1,000 credit, which means I would be paying $2,200 for a used machine and I have to buy more miners at full price in order to use the credit. I told them I wouldn't buy a used one for more than $1,800. If Viepra thinks the used machine is worth more than that, by all means, please take it and give me a refund.Today, they sent me another email asking me to withdraw the claim. They insisted on giving me $1,000 credit and told me that the cost of the parts plus shipping is $703 as if the parts were brand new and I was responsible for the defects. I'm pretty sure the parts they are sending are used and cost them almost nothing except the shipping, and I'm obviously not going to be responsible for them. I might as well claim a thousand dollars on the replacing parts labor and loss of mining opportunity.I own a business and the last thing I want to do is to ruin a business with a negative review. But I have spent enough time trying to resolve issues with them. All I got was shady car salesman bait-and-switch responses from Vipera."

Separate shipments due to some customs delays in the US (2 got stuck in LA for a few days) but nevertheless they all arrived via DHL while I tracked the delays. They are currently up and running as advertised. Expect to receive a Purchasing Agreement from them. Initially had some issues with PayPal (likely on my end since it was a new account), so I ended up wiring the payment with no issue. Reckless? Perhaps...however, the fact that they have an active PayPal account and offer that as a payment method assured me that they are legit - and they are. Suzanne, Maggie and Mark were all very helpful whether it was over the phone or via email during the process. I'm not sure why there are 1 star reviews with people claiming they're scammers. They aren't. I'm planning to make another order with them, and recommend for anyone that might be skeptical of some of the competitors out there."

          "Contenu": "On 10/19/2022 I ordered a Gigabyte RTX 4090 gpu from this company as it was the only retailer that allowed me to order at a decent price. I was worried about this website at first because I\u2019d never heard of it before and I saw 1 or 2 negative reviews online. So I was wondering when I would get my $2000 GPU after a week of not receiving it. After some back and forth with customer service. I was told it would be shipped a week later as their supply was less than they anticipated. Again after another week I still hadn\u2019t received any shipping info for my product. After a final call they told me they still hadn\u2019t received enough Gigabyte GPUs so they offered to send me a Zotac AMP Extreme Airo GPU for the same price which is a slight upgrade. Sure enough 5 days later I got my GPU on 11/14/2022. Everything seems to be running great and I\u2019m super relieved and happy! This website is definitely legit, just keep in mind it\u2019s probably a smaller tech company and you may need to use their customer service and be patient."

The two brand-new units came in the original Bitmain boxes from HK. The Bitmain boxes were delivered dented but the units were not damaged due to thick foam insulation. I wish they put the Bitmain box in another box to conceal the content. Overall, I'm satisfied with the purchase from Viperatech. The pricing at Viperatech is probably the best out there.   You do not need to worry about import duties and taxes. The shipping takes time but it will come. Update 1:I'm updating this review with 3 stars since they have responded and are trying to resolve the issues.Viperatech responded on Jan 19 and offered to replace the two miners with brand-new ones. The shipments are being delayed because of the Chinese New Year. They said, \"freight forwarders will return to work on Jan 29th.\" I will update the review again once I receive the shipment confirmation.Original Review:The product was described as \"Used - Canada Stock\" but it was shipped from Hong Kong. Viperatech refused to cancel the shipment. The items came in bad condition and one of them is not working. They have not responded to my messages."

          "Contenu": "I\u2019ve read some negative reviews for Viperatech on other review sites, and I made an account here just to set the record straight and say those are probably all shills trying to take business away from Vipera! So yes, it doesn\u2019t matter if I only have 1 review. I don\u2019t do reviews on trust pilot, except this one. Not sure if I\u2019ll do more.Anyway, I ordered 2 crypto mining ASICs for a total of about $8000. Vipera is listed as a trusted retailer on ASIC Miner Value, so I decided to ignore the bad reviews and give them a shot. The ASICs arrived in 7 days from the time I submitted the order! I did pay for expedited shipping, but that\u2019s still pretty fast from Hong Kong, taking into account customs. Which was all included in the price of the ASICs, by the way. And yes, I guess they do drop ship direct from the source sometimes, which is fine by me. It means a lower price and the assurance that the product is brand spanking new, which they were. I was able to set the miners up that day and they work flawlessly. Some reviews state that they don\u2019t reply to emails often, but that\u2019s understandable if you take into account that it seems like they are a large distributor moving a lot of tech for a lot of clients. If you research Viperatech, they have stores all over the world, and they all look extremely high tech. Unless you think AI or CGI has advanced to ridiculous levels, I have no idea why some people are even considering Vipera a scam. All of their addresses for all their stores and contact info is listed on their site, including phone numbers. It\u2019s easy enough to verify their legitimacy. You can see for yourself with a little googling that they are a multinational operation, so replying to emails from individuals may be a little difficult. But, rest assured, when they do reply, it\u2019s honest, and to the point. You don\u2019t have to worry, you\u2019ll get your stuff. I got a text from DHL with tracking, and they even arrived a day early!Time is money with crypto mining, so thank you very much James, and Viperatech, for the excellent service and lightning fast processing and shipping!"

So In my experience, i bought an L7 Antminer from them, i paid with credit card on 10.29.2022, expecting it would ship in a few days, when it didn't i got worried, I messaged their customer support on 11.10.2022 who replied really quickly and said there would be a delay because they sold out the day i placed the order due to a recent Doge/LTC rally, which was odd to me because there was no mention of that when i placed my order, but they did give me an option to cancel my order and get a refund but i decided to stick with it so I waited.(I did feel like they should have messaged their customers directly to let them know of any delays for high value items, i had to message them to find out about the delay after 10 days of already making the purchase, but that is just my opinion)   Then on 11.19.2022 i recieved my tracking number and the package was delivered safely on 12.01.2022in secure packaging and in brand new condition.   Their customer service was a little strange but helpful. Overall i had a positive experience with them and will be coming back."
