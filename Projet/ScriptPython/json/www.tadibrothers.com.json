          "Contenu": "I ordered a backup camera for my F150 Truck with the expectation of easy and quick installation, as assured by the salesman. However, upon receiving the package, the only thing that proved easy was installing the rearview mirror. Despite seeking assistance from TadiBrothers, I found minimal support. Consequently, I had to resort to a mechanic for installation, incurring additional costs of over $300, bringing the total expense to over $600.Unfortunately, the camera's performance fell short, offering a subpar view compared to any stock backup camera I've used before. Additionally, the camera malfunctioned after only about a month of use. It remains unclear whether the issue lies with the installation or the camera itself, leaving me dissatisfied and back at square one.In hindsight, I regret not opting for Ford's installation services. If you're considering a backup camera, I strongly recommend going through a dealer. I've learned from this experience and won't make the same mistake again."

          "Contenu": "Update 2/6/23 These people are the total worst. After posting the initial review they literally called me and texted me up to 4 times a day claiming they wanted to \"make me happy\". I do not agree with their claim. They dont care about making me happy, they just wanted this 1 star review taken down. The only way they were going to send me a replacement camera was if I took this review off. A camera by the way should have been replaced right away due to warranty.  Gabe with Tadi Brothers would absolutely not send a replacement camera unless I took this review off.I double down on my review. These guys sell cheap cameras you can get on amazon for 50 bucks then slap a Tadi Brothers sticker on it. On top of that they dont cover their warranty. You guys are sleezy, pushy and strong arm people for minimal amounts of money.So i still dont have a replacement camera that should be covered under warranty and doubt ill get one because this review is staying up. What a great company right?Original review: 1/18/23 Camera got water in it after 4 months. Sent it back and they claimed i tried to switch cameras. They claimed the serial numbers didnt not match from the order. There wasnt a single serial number on any of the equipment. Lying cheap company that sells chinese basic cameras with their stickers on them. Stay away unless you want to waste money."

          "Contenu": "Update: I was again forced to change my review so it could be published. Apparently Trustpilot believes in double standards for the use of peoples names on reviews. As long as you are praising them it is ok but if you have bad review trustpilot will remove it for the company. I now know how they have so many great reviews.Got an email wanting more info. Not much more info to give it is all spelled out right here. CS Guy was extremely rude, lied and called coworkers really ugly names. It started out good but went down hill in a hurry. First CS Guy refused to ship my part they owed me period until I removed the bad review I had put here. Claims his boss made him do it. If this is the way they do business stay away. This is mafia style business. They sent me two side cameras instead of a side and rearview. First customer service guy said they couldn't replace my the camera without them first having the wrong camera in hand. So then I was put in touch with CS Guy. Boy is this guy a joke. He would climb highest tree in the land to tell you a lie before he would stand on level ground and tell the truth. Talked to him on July 3 he swore to me my package would be sent 2nd day mail on July 5. so it would be here before we left on vacation. That was a lie it wasn't shipped until July 7 standard shipping which already guarantied it would not be here for our 3000 mile trip. Then USPS sent it to Maryland and it got lost and didn't show up for 5 days after we left on vacation. Also unless you have absolute line of site the wireless is a waste of money. Had a guy that had a $50.00 camera on a 32' trailer that the wireless worked like a champ. CS Guy need not see this and call me. If anyone calls one of the owners he claims made him make me removes the review needs to all. Ohhh yeah boss he also said your useless nephew was what started all of the problems and he doesn't deserve a job. I can't repeat here all the nasty dirty names he called him"

          "Contenu": "I purchased a backup camera from this seller, and it was one of the most unpleasant experiences I have had in recent memory.  The monitor and camera I purchased came with no instructions, and I had to pay someone to install.  The seller advised me that the product was wireless and would have all of the necessary components needed to install as a wireless system.  As it was, the installer told me that the wireless devices they provided were not adequate and they ended up having to install as a wired device, which added to the cost of the installation.  It appears that the sales reps at Tadi are not very well versed in their products.   In this case, buying on the internet was a very unpleasant experience.  I also had difficulty getting a list of installers from the seller (Tadi)."

They said my mechanic must be stupid because apparently a baboon can install these cameras. I had just paid $200 to have it installed and a hole had to be drilled into the bumper to accommodate the camera so needless to say, I was incredibly disappointed with their attitude. All-in-all, a $385 kick in the head: $200 to have it installed, $80 to have it uninstalled and $40 to ship it back plus the $65. they charged me for the wire that was left in the car (otherwise it would have cost double to take that out too and apparently this is a standard wire that can be purchased for around $20) Very rude guys who blow a gasket without provocation. I hope they lose business because of this review; They deserve it."

          "Contenu": "Purchased a backup camera a couple months ago. Didn't end up needing it so it was never opened and returned in original box. A few weeks later, a partial refund posts (even though they have a 100% hassle free refund policy). I chatted and called - chat person couldn't help and said to call. On the phone, they said not all the parts were returned which obviously a lie because the box was never opened. Now seeing other reviews, it's clear they've tried to defraud other customers this way. They said to email them and they will help sort it out, but they haven't responded to any emails. Had the chat -> phone -> email run around then radio silence. Had to dispute with the credit card company.Not sure how their products may be because we didn't use ours but if there's a chance you may have to return a product, either don't order from them or take pics of the items being returns and set aside 2-3 hours of your time fighting them on the partial refund they will offer at first (as it seems that's their policy of doing business).Edit: 7/14/22 1:40pm. Just received a call from them and from one of their customer service agents saying we should have been refunded the full amount. They then said they will refund it as soon as I take down this review. After telling them I wouldn't, they transferred me to another supervisor lying about the dates of delivery and return. I have all the proof and he further threatened to give me the refund only if I take down the review. I have the entire call recorded and will post the link here shortly for everyone to listen to how they do business if they do not do what is right and approve the refund by EOD today.Edit: 7/14/22 Shortly after. Tadi Brothers flagged my review and reported it a violation of Trustpilot policies (which it isn't). I email the phone recordings of them threatening me to remove the review and sent it into Trustpilot and they unblocked the review.Edit: Late Afternoon 7/14/22. After telling Tadi Brothers I was filing a complaint with the California Attorney General and them coming to their senses that they were completely in the wrong and continually lied to me, they gave me another call back and finally said they would refund the order. They said no strings attached but then said \"wouldn't the review be false now that they refunded me?\" I told them all the facts in this review occurred and it doesn't negate their previous actions but thanked them for finally issuing the refund I was owed. They asked to reconsider the review and maybe increase to 2 or 3 stars and said reviews like this hurt their business. I explained that they wouldn't receive reviews like this if they don't try to defraud their customers and treat people fairly and honestly.Overall, be very careful dealing with this company. I hope they take these actions to heart and start to operate their business in an ethical way."

The specifications sheet that came in the box stated it is :                               Effective pixels PAL 628x586, NTSC 510x496Horizontal resolution as 480TVLLens angle 170 degreesIP68 not 69\u201cHD refers to cameras with a standardized resolution of 720p or 1080p. The numbers 720 and 1080 refer to the horizontal resolution. Therefore, 720p HD camera resolution provides images that are 1280 x 720 pixels that adds up to 921,600 pixels, which means a 720p HD camera is not technically a megapixel camera, and 1080p HD cameras provide 1920 x 1080-pixel resolution, or 2.1 megapixels\u201d628 x 586 vs CCD HD I paid extra for.170 degree viewable angle vs 130 I paid extra for.Grid lines were fixed vs movable I paid extra for.Furrion bracket and adapter1-95\u2019 transmitter vs the 70\u2019 I was expectingBench tested and the monitor went to black & white after 3 minutes of being on. Called Tadi and find where you can talk to the sales department anytime service is \u201cleave a message\u201dResponse:1) CCD HD Camera \u201c It is an HD camera, the specifications sheet is out dated\u201d Really a manufacturer is going to include a specifications sheet that makes their product look like a lower grade than it is? NO\t  No mention to refund the $49.99.The picture in the monitor was MUCH worst than the back up camera in my car.2) 130 degree view \u201cThey do not offer 130 only 120, 150 or 170 degree\u201dThey never asked what angle I would like and the specifications sheet calls out 170 degree field of view\u201d                                      \tNo mention to refund the $19.99.3) They supply a cable to mount the transmitter remotely BUT you must supply a cable to power the transmitter.As for the 95\u201d  \u201c It is what we supply to all our customers to give them the best reception.4) Movable grid lines. \u201cThey do not offer moving grid lines, only fixed\u201d \t\t\t\t\t\t\tNO mention to refund the $52.995) As it was only showing black & white I asked for a return authorization number. They sent me an email with the address to return it. Sent a reply to their email stating, as the unit was defective out of the box THEY should pay for the return shipping.They did email me a UPS label to print and attach to box.Took a picture off all components I was returning in the box. Sealed and sent it back.1-28-22I get a phone call from Tadi \u201cThey want to review a few things I did wrong\u201dYA THAT WENT OVER WELLAs for Black & white \u201cmust be a bad solder joint\u201d. Field of view \u201cI got 150 degree\u201d even though the specifications sheet called out 170 degree field of view\u201d and they missed the WHOLE point I ordered 130 degrees. No comment on not being HD or moving grid line.Next they tell me the Furrion adaptor kit is not in the box, \u201csometimes people miss returning it and so they will be deducting that from my refund\u201d The fact I took a picture of the contents of the box I returned to them back them up. I emailed the photo, which clearly shows the Furrion package in the box, to everyone I had an email for.Full refund was posted to my card.In closing a few more things to know other that items mention above:1) The cigarette lighter power adaptor is extra. This is mentioned in one of their videos.2) EVERYTHING you get is made in China.   FYI3) Caveat emptor"

I had to pay \u00bd of three-day air so I would have monitor in time for next leg of journey.Installation of system took one full day.Total of four phone calls and ten texts with the customer service manager. Last two texts 4/17 and 4/28 requesting refund have gone unanswered. Shipping has not been refunded as of today, 5/2/23! Monitor seems fine but problems with Camera:Image is not HD, image is spasmodic and jerky, blanks out for three to five seconds after passing under overpass, signal drops out intermittently for several seconds, has a one to two second delay to display on monitor. Finally received a $368.29 refund on May 24. A partial refund of the incorrect $451 order, according to the Tadi Bros website for my account.  The actual order was for $426.24, including the three-day shipping that didn\u2019t happen. I calculate that I am still owed $57.95.Absolutely a horrible experience. I recommend that you look somewhere else. Buyer beware.Updated Sept 7. \"I have received a full refund for the system. Thank you, gentleman who I think was an owner (no one wants personal information, especially names, to be included in these reviews).I have upgraded this review to two stars, only because one and a half is not possible. The experience I has has not changed\u2014it was and will always be a nightmare experience.The gent who arranged the full refund seemed to be more interested in the number of stars in the review than the actual customer experience. As a matter of fact he asked, if I understood him correctly during an extended phone call in late July, that I either remove the One Star review or change it to a Five Star review because I have received the full refund. As I have said, the experience was what it was and that will never change. I told him that I would make my decision about changing the review once I had proof of the refund. The account is my wife\u2019s card and she only informed me of the refund about a week ago. I apologize for the delay in responding to the refund. My personal integrity demands that I stand by the truth."

They reluctently swapped out my system after a few months, and it had problem too.  It was always crashing, rebooting, cycling on and off.. ect.  I just became burned out with dealing with it... I wanted the DVR function to work reliably.. but it was very inconsitant.  I just lived with it because in my RV I really need it to be a side view monitor so I can see in the blind spot.. which it did do that 90% of the time.  Fast forward to 2022 and I damaged my side camera.  I called Tadi bros and they looked up my account, I gave them my credit card number, and they sent me camera for $90.  I set it aside for a couple months until I had time to install it, and when I opened the box, I realized they sent me the wrong camera.  I contacted them and asked for a return label, and they told me they don't issue them, and since it has been over 30 days I can't return it.  They offered me a \"discount\" on the right camera as a solution.  I finally found the camera I need on Amazon for $70.. the exact same camera they have marked up to $200.  I purchased the camera and hooked it up..it works fine.  The problem is the DVR function had stopped working altogether .. and the unit itself barely works now days.  I am going to just tear that piece of crap out and replace it with a MUCH better one I purchased on ebay for less that half the price...  I would avoid these folks because you are paying a premium mark-up for poor quality items, and poor quality service...EVEN WORSE.. Tadi Bro called me within MINITUES of posting this review offering a refund if I \"remove the review\".. I declined because they should do what's right, and THEN allow me to make a decision.. not bribe  or bully me into anything.  The then went to Trust Pilot to contest the review as if I was not a real customer in hope I would not respond, and thus silence me that way.. well guess what.. I AM a real customer, and I will respond with Proof to trust-pilot... Quit trying to silence the truth and do the right thing in the first place TadiBrothers!!!"

          "Contenu": "I purchased the TadiBrothers backup camera system:   Pickup truck wireless seven inch mirror monitor and license plate/frame camera.  All was delivered in about 10 days.  The installation was reasonably intuitive.\r The instructions are plentiful, but are \u201cone size fits all!\u201d  In other words, none of my backup system components looked like the pictures shown in the graphic instructions; you have to know how to \u201cread between the lines.\u201d\r The 7\u201d mirror backup camera system functioned, but it was woefully useless in my circumstances.  I have a small pickup truck and during daylight hours, the light flooding into the cab was so bright, it was totally impossible to see the transmitted image in the mirror monitor.  The angle of view for the backup camera was 90\u00b0, not the 120\u00b0 angle advertised on the TadiBrothers\u2019 website.  I checked the angle by triangulation. \r I emailed TadiBrothers who responded by suggesting replacement of the \u201cdefective\u201d 90\u00b0 camera and swapping the mirror for a seven inch monitor.  They even offered to pay for shipping of the returned components.  I accepted.\r The replacement license plate camera still has the 90\u00b0 viewing angle, not the 120\u00b0 advertised.  I found the 90\u00b0 to be sufficient for my purposes, so I accepted it.  I have the new monitor mounted under the dash out of the light.   It works adequately, but the colors are not reproduced faithfully.  No amount of adjustments of color, hue, brightness, or contrast could improve the color.\r CONCLUSION:  My TadiBrothers backup camera system is acceptable for viewing low and behind.   They did come through with something that works for me.  My only suggestions are that TadiBrothers should make their instructions more system specific and investigate why they sold me a 90\u00b0 camera instead of the 120\u00b0 camera advertised.  Also, they need to warn customers of the inadequacy of the mirror type monitor.  I feel TadiBrothers\u2019 intentions are good, but I think their backup camera systems need serious company scrutiny."

          "Contenu": "Rose in sales chat argues with you and gives answers that are not truly straight forward and the whole process was difficult to get answers to exactly what we needed.This is a very high-pressure sales business. After a supervisor called me directly and requested this review to be taken down and promised me the moon to do so, I stood firm on my promise to edit the review after he did his part.  That's part of the way you review things after following through, and I will continue to stand by this review if the product or promises do not happen. I was also promised that he would make sure everything worked before it shipped, I hope this is not the way they get rid of the bad, open box, or returned stock. Now I have to prepare to find a place to store the moon if the supervisor does in fact make this happen.Update, the sales experience obviously has not changed that's history. Yes the supervisor did give me his direct phone number and when the product did not work he pointed out where to look for a small red light. It was not working so 3 hrs later I was able to locate a replacement fuse and the system started working. While Rose kept insisting the cameras would work from 150 feet I have enough experience and common sense to know the 150 feet is strictly in open areas, not 150 feet or even 35 feet through a camper behind my truck. The signal and picture does not refresh fast enough to keep from hitting something if you are using it to backup. This is not the companies issue but a fact of how wireless works still something I was told would not be a problem.As of 7/21 I am updating the review from the original 1 star to 3 stars because it at least works some of the time."

          "Contenu": "UPDATE: I had a manager call me after initial review and he was very helpfull, He personally gets 5 stars *****. He imediately refunded the 15 dollar handling charge and offered a discount on a different system he thought would work, most importantly, he understood and knows about the monitor problems. I updated my rating from 1 to 3 for his efforts. The company still has its issues, as for all the hoops they had me jumping through for months. I chose a different brand on the system, although at the end they were helpful, I have trust concerns with TadiBrothers as a whole. ORIGINAL reveiw: Had problems with the system out of the box. I called, sent emails and pics to which they ignored. I continued to have problems and they asked me to sent it back, at my expense, they plugged it in and it worked. I talked with them at that time and told them I could do that to, but doesn't work in real world conditions. I asked them to put it in freezer and try it, which they did not.  They returned bad system to me, and I did the trouble shooting to prove that the monitor fails below freezing. I just wanted a monitor that worked. They treat every call as a new complaint, even though there is a long record of emails, pictures, videos and phone calls on record, very frustrating. Finally after 3 months of stress, 20 plus hours of my time, they asked me to return the product for a full refund. So, i sent it back, again, at my expense. Finally get refund 18 days after they receive it, for $260.04, but the purchase price was $274.99. So I have lost the $30 in shipping, and then they take take an extra $15 from me for good measure. At 52 this has been the worst customer service I have received, dishonest and disgusting."

          "Contenu": "After ordering online, promptly received products. Bought system that required drilling hole in rear door of vehicle for camera. To do installation of camera, wiring and wireless transmitter obviously had to remove paneling for inside access. Installed all the system  paying attention that there is no orientation mark on camera and nothing in instructions to tell that camera is required to be rotated to a certain point for it to see the world as it is. Put all the paneling back on and installed monitor system up front. Turned on system to find that the camera needed rotated about 1/4 turn because it was seeing the world sideways. Because of this had to retake paneling and dirt barrier back off hatch door, rotate camera then reassemble. Would it not be a huge customer service to put an orientation mark, an \"UP' or \"TOP\" marking or something on camera or at least mention it in the instructions. Removal and installation of the access panels and dirt barrier were no fun to remove and install the first time, let alone the second time. This is surely not the first time that an installer has encountered this and mentioned it to the seller. The jury is still out on the dependability and durability of the product but getting a good set of installation instructions would be huge. Might want to mention also that there is very gray areas of presentation of product on their prepared presentation. 7\" mirror monitor is good representation of its width but would be nice to know the height of it because it takes up so much room it is vision infringing looking out the windshield and is maybe even unsafe. Don't feel like I have been lied to but just feel like  the problems I have encountered are probably things other  customers have encountered but the seller is not as concerned about good service as good sales."

The man on the phone this time confirmed my order would be sent out that day by 2pm from the California warehouse as the Midwest warehouse was out of stock of some of the parts. I wasn\u2019t thrilled as they were shipping ground from California to Michigan, a week late. I then called two days later and spoke with a man named Hans who informed me the order had STILL not been shipped and went out of his way to make sure the order was shipped for me. I appreciate his help immensely as I cannot leave for my winter work plans until my camera is installed on my trailer. Thank you Hans."

I relented and paid $18 to send my side camera back to them.  They repaired it under warranty and sent it back within 7 days.  I started out with my monitor on the console and the sun light canceled that out.  I made a magnetic mount on the dash and that was the ticket.  I bought a battery pack for the fourth camera,  after the fact and use that as a portable camera showing,  in part, the side of the rv that I am running up on the ramps,  etc. Works fabulously.  Easy as can be.  What a terrific resource.   The other cameras were mounted to our fifth wheel and provide excellent situational awareness while driving."

          "Contenu": "Josan has just helped remedy a situation which has gone on far too long.  The 5 star rating is for her help in (maybe) resolving this issue, not the quality of what I bought.  The basic problem I had is that the wireless unit I first bought (349 dollars) was a piece of cheap, worthless, junk\u2026. I\u2019ve spoken to at least 3 people about the fact that this thing never worked correctly, didn\u2019t work correctly after I sent it back for repairs, and what little picture I did get on occasion was delayed and totally useless for any type of decision making, backing up, or lane changing.  We made a 5-month bucket-list trip this summer back and forth across the US and Canada.  The camera was turned off and put in storage because it was useless.  Granted, not everything made in China is perfect.  The way the antenna attached to the back of the camera and screen  ( a melted plastic retainer) set a new low in cheapness.  Despite words of assurances that all bench checks were \u201cgood\u201d, the unit was returned with the antenna wire separated from the antenna.  But, what really added insult to injury in this situation was the attitude from your company in that \u201cthis is normal and good, how can you not like it?\u201d  Words of platitude did us no good.  I do, however, appreciate the 200 dollar trade-in value towards what I hope will be a better unit.  I also paid an extra 100 dollars for a \u201cnew\u201d warranty, plus the difference in the upgrade.  So, in answer to what I felt about paying an extra 110 dollars, plus twice shipping back a bad unit which began this whole fiasco in the first place; I\u2019m positively \u201coverjoyed\u201d\u2014sarcasm intended.  Overall, I rate your company as a \u201c2\u201d."

Sherwin was very courteous, precise in his explanations, and very knowledgeable.If I have any friends or family that are interested in doing what I\u2019ve done, I will not hesitate to not only tell them about Tadi Brothers, but I will tell them to ask for Sherwin, by name, that\u2019s how impressed I was."

Secondly he was very personal and patient in making sure I understood the direction and proper wiring practice he was giving me on how to make this unit compatible with my trailer.  To ensure satisfactory customer service I was left with a phone number - not a usual practice in my experience with other companies and very much appreciated by myself. Thanks very much"

          "Contenu": "Every business likes to claim they have great customer service but the reality is for most, once they get your money you are left on your own.  My experience started shortly after placing my order when I got a call that they had just shipped the last one of that model and I could either wait for the next shipment or possibly consider a new model that had just arrived.  They supplied me a link to look at the new system and I decided to switch to it.  They expedited the shipping and I received it a couple of days later.  Already a pleasant experience with the company.Once I installed the screen and camera in my van I realized the screen was upside down.  The cameras rotated but not the screen.  I called customer service and spoke to Josan.  Since the system was new she asked me to video the problem and send her the video.  I sent it and a few hours later I received an email from Josan saying they had received the video and were looking for a fix.  The next day I got a call from her with instructions on how to fix it.After following the instruction everything worked perfectly.  I sent her an email with thanks for the prompt replies.  I was surprised the following day to get a followup call from Josan just to check that everything was okay.Believe you won\u2019t get that kind of service from most businesses.A real pleasurable experience."

When I received my cameras I could not wait to install them .The install went very well I did have a few questions so I called Tadi Brothers and spoke with Gabe he was very helpful in answering all my questions and even gave me some good pointers .After using the cameras on 2 trips I noticed my passenger side camera was blurry .So I call Gabe and he asked for picture to help him identify the problem .Gabe asked for me to send back that camera for further review so I did .A few day later Gabe called me and said the camera had a piece of glue on the inside lens .They fixed it like new and sent it back works perfect until I turned the system off and tried to power it back up all screens said no signal .So I tried pairing all cameras and nothing worked .I contacted Tadi Brothers and had the opportunity to talk with Tamir one of the owners and after I spoke with him I learned that this system works a lot  better with having the power direct to it's own fuse block a very simple fix to a problem I had. It is great to have such good support when something goes wrong and my system is unbelievable the clarity of the cameras are the best.I recommend this system it is very easy to install and use ."
