So basically 0 of requests were succesfull because of that. I've asked what is the issue and they said that YOU HAVE TO BE APPROVED FOR SPECIFIC WEBSITES. That is their answer \" \"websitename\" is blocked by us so it does not get abused.Can you please provide us with your specifc use case?Based on that we can unblock it.\"I gave them all the info and said that I am currently using 450$ monthly subscription on another proxy service and I'm testing new ones (to show them that I may become their customer with monthly up to 500$ payments)However thats their reply: \"Unfortunately I was unable to get your account approved for this domain. Let us know if we can help you with anything else.\" So that's basically it. There is extremely high chance thats your target website is blocked by them. There is NO PAGE ON THEIR WEBSITE that says that some websites are unavailable to connect via their proxies. Hence thats a scam. I am currently in contact with paddle.com in order to show them how they scam their customers by not providing true information."

          "Titre": "DO NOT RECOMMEND (AVOID)",
          "Contenu": "Okay, so I will try to be as detailed about why I have given this a negative rating and review. When you signup for ProxyRack, you initially are NOT required to provide identity verification. The ONLY way you have to verify identity with ID is if you choose Paddle as the payment processor when purchasing a subscription to their proxies. Now, the issue that I was having is that when I selected to use Payssion which allows me to use Crypto to pay for a subscription and DOES NOT require identity verification since using Payssion. Apparently, they updated the terms and made it so that now, new accounts are required to verify identity using a 3rd party website regardless if you would like to purchase a subscription via crypto currency. I absolutely understand requiring ID verification if someone would like to use a credit card, bank card, or even a bank account. But virtual currency that\u2019s irreversible should not have to verify ID. Another HUGE ISSUE is the response time it took to get any response from support. So this took over 3-4 days for me to get a final answer on this situation because 2 days ago I was told by Ariana, \u201c If you pay through Payssion, you do not need to undergo the verification process\u201d.And Today, which is over 2 days since I was told that I received a message back from Ariana that says, \u201cUnfortunately, the terms and conditions of the said payment method have been updated recently and now includes verification requirements for added security measures.\u201dSo, this is absolutely ridiculous. Again, I am trying to pay with crypto so you either need to add a crypto payment processor like Coinbase or something to allow those that do not want to submit ID documents online an alternative to be able to purchase a subscription. You are only going to lose more and more customers. Im going to spread the word unless this changes either back to the way it was before this change was made or another crypto payment option so we don\u2019t have to verify ID. And also it\u2019s a shame it takes support over 1-2 days to respond to both email or messenger on the website. DO NOT RECOMMENDED PURCHASING FROM PROXYRACK very bad business practices."

          "Contenu": "I have bought their 100 Shared Datacenter Proxies but there was threads limit. I asked their support how to increase the limit, they answered upgrade your proxy. So I checked the web there is no option for upgrading the plan. What you can do is cancel(get refund) on your previous plan and purchase a new, more expensive one.Therefore I bought the 1,000 Shared Datacenter Proxies according to their support's suggestion, but it didn't work well. So I asked for a refund. Then they refused to do and told me I am not eligible for refund because there was a refund happened. I told them the previous refund was for upgrading the proxy, but they ignored. They say\"Money Back Guarantee\" on their page but I never receive a refund.----------- reply to ProxyRack -----------Like I said, the previous refund was for upgrading/downgrading the plan, I never asked for a real refund. Your website doesn't have upgrading options for customer and now you are blaming customer have too many refunds? The refunds are caused by you, not the customer.Last time I used the service, it was great and I was happy. But this time, you have changed your product without noticing your customers. For example, the thread limit. There is no page that indicates your shared datacenter proxies have the thread limit, not even on the product detail page. I purchased the same plan like I did last time, but found out it is completely different thing I have used before and you refused to issue a refund. Thus, I regard your product as a serious deception.You also mentioned that I heavily using the service for nearly half a year? I suggest you look at your logs closely and learn how to do math. I have used your service for one month and did I use it for free? I paid the full price and I believe the price already cover all the maintenance fees. I have purchased the service on Sep 4th and asked a refund on Sep 5th. I did used some of the bandwidth for testing therefore I asked for a pro-rata refund.And I also received an email states \"ProxyRack: Transaction Refunded\" but I never get the money. Is this another deception? If you can not issue the refund why you have sent the confirmation email? And you never contact me about the this until I found out there is no refund."

I wanted to purchase a subscription, however the verification this business tries to force you to comply to when purchasing a subscription is ridiculous. I shouldn\u2019t have to verify my identity when using crypto to purchase a subscription. I have seen others have the same exact issues. So previously you wasn\u2019t required to verify ID using Payssion. It even stated this in their terms of service and their FAQ section. Now I can\u2019t purchase a subscription to the proxies unless I verify my identification although I am using Bitcoin to purchase.. Well this is going to cause you to only lose more and more customers. FIX THIS AND MAYBE ILL COME BACKEDIT: I posted my original review on August 11th and it\u2019s now August 21st and you are just now responding to my review. Hence why I said it\u2019s horrible support. Took over 10 days to get even a response on trustpilot. Also my name is John, not Mark. So I\u2019m. It sure where in the world you got that name from but I\u2019m not the other person that left a negative review. I am a separate individual reviewing your service which was proven when providing the documents to trustpilot so that they can verify my review."

It took several days because the problem was not simple. After solving the problems, support extended the service life of the proxy for free. I've been using their proxies for 8 months, and the support has always responded politely and helped (of course, I always had to wait).In general, proxies work stably; if any problem arises, support will definitely help you and will not leave you offended. I can only rely on my experience with this service, and it has been mostly positive. There were quite a few problems over the course of 8 months, since I use proxies in UNIQUE conditions (an ordinary user is unlikely to encounter them), but the problems were always solved by specialists. Always."

          "Contenu": "I give 5 stars due to the team always being happy to help, service was once superb, as in the proxies were impeccable, recent times proxy rack gained more attention I think that the residential needs to be checked for uptime more regularly, so like at least 10 second intervals, and if they replaced all non working say, 10-20% every 12-25 hours, it would be excellent. But for most cases the proxies will suit every need, the affiliate program is a great bonus, and there are some coupon codes, that don't expire which give a great bang for buck 50% off. They recently discovered that threading wasn't performing as it was supposed to, and that we could easily make our threads say 1000, when our connection was what 100, and we could easily bypass that. This has dropped tasks per minute on certain tools, but regardless it's the same quality give or take. So overall this brings my rating to a 5 regardless of the downsides."

On any proxy-service proxy ips get banned, you get recaptcha, you have to rotate it etc. With proxyrack I DONT THING ABOUT proxies and recatcha anymore! i set up them one time and now with EVERY request i have new ip. No captchas, no bans, no lags. Isn't that a dream? Sometimes i need ips for longer time for parsing pictures. ( i can setup 20 mins for ip change, and have one static ip!)I am very satisfied with the service and support they have. Response in 12 hours before the NY?) Yep. Happy upcoming new year, glad i found these guys and have already referred 6 friends here( they are long-term users now too).Hope my opinion helps. Best regards,Bogdan."
