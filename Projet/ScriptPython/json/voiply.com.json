I asked on the sales support chat if this is possible with a residential/home plan. The bot said: yes. I signed up and paid almost $300 for a yearly plan and some hardware, and instantly wanted to find out how to configure my Cisco phones. It turns out - they don't support it. Now I wasted 2 hours of my life and possibly a lot more, because they have not confirmed the cancellation of my order yet."

Also, I indicated that we had Starlink and would like to use the Starlink router-I was told that wouldn't be a problem but it was. We had to purchase another router to make it work.

We live in an area code where that is not required per the FCC. We are not used to having to dial the area code, and others here wouldn't know they have to do that to reach our particular phone. I think this would be a good thing for your company to work out, since there are other areas around the country like ours, and I would think this needs to be resolved not just for us but for others like us. In the short time we have had this system, we have found sometimes one must dial the area code to reach our land line, and sometimes not. Conversely, sometimes calling out from the landline, we must include the area code and sometimes not. We are still trying to figure all that out."
