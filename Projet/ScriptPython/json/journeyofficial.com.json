When I reached out to the company, the representative told me that they do not offer next day delivery on their products.  So either the company is falsely advertising on their website or the representative is clueless.  Needless to say, once I do receive the product I will be returning it because of this fraudulent act, and I will no longer consider them for any future purchases.  I would advise you to do the same."

Their response was what phone am I using, does your phone have a magnetic protector on it, and can you please send a video of the stand not working....if it has a 1 year warranty and its only 3 weeks old, it seems odd that I have to prove it doesn't work. As a new company, I would think you would just accept my issues as valid and send me a new immediately. I can send the non-working one back and issue resolved."

          "Contenu": "Looks really nice on my desk. Feels nice, charges well. For the price I paid, I feel there is really nothing better about it then the $30-$45 on other online retailers. On day one, I spilled a cup of water on the non-charging side. 1/3 got soaked and it took 2 days to fully dry hanging on the felted seam on a clothes line. The water resistant vegan leather part dried in one day, and the Felt part took 2. I don't think that a desk mat should be \"water resistant\" and for the price they want, it should be water REPELLANT. Spills are common and a consumer should not have to wait a min of 1-2 days for it to line dry. Luckily it was water. I feel if its any other liquid, the product will soak it permanently. Also, I had some documents stored inside the mat which got completely soaked because of the rapidness of the Felt absorbing the spill. To charge $130 for a mat just because it looks pretty and has a charger, is ridiculous and there should be more \"life proof\" features at this price point...Like magnets around the vegan leather and felt to help seal the documents that are stowed and make all the material water repellant.In Conclusion, I was really upset about the fact that my documents were ruined, its not life proof, and soaks liquids like a towel, and you cant easily dry it and cannot use it while you wait days for it to dry."

Ultimately, so long the product has not been damaged then the seller probably would just repackage this and sell again anyway. This policy is solely designed to discourage quick returns and the choice of adopting this policy would make me hesitant to recommend this company and has honestly discouraged me from purchasing from them. Not to mention the extortionate charge for P&P - I paid \u00a37.99 for the charger to arrive in a plastic postal bag and paid for RM Tracked 24 which costs \u00a36 anyway, \u00a31.49 additional charge for someone to click and drop via RM website. While this was late (though more the fault of RM strikes rather than Journey). The reason I am so infuriated with these practices is these are NOT consumer friendly and do not put the customer at heart of what they do."

          "Contenu": "Mount is very expensive for its category and frankly doesn't work very well. The stabilizing arm works okay for keeping it steady with normal use but it doesn't work too well if you want to make any adjustments, e.g. rotation to landscape. It's also pretty easy to pull it out of the vent because the magnetic connection is stronger than the grip holding it on the vent.The charging is pretty weak on an iPhone 13 Pro; I find that it tends to keep the battery level wherever it is when it starts, but the charge level doesn't seem to go up. Granted, this is a problem with all wireless charging and not specifically the mount.On the plus side, it looks pretty nice, but overall you're probably better off getting something for half the cost on Amazon."

          "Contenu": "I purchased their iPhone 14 Pro leather case which I must admit looks great however, its design lets it down massively. The buttons simply do not function - by this I mean they either hold down the power/volume buttons completely (so it consistently activated Siri or takes screenshots) or they just don\u2019t function at all. Journey customer service responded very quickly and dispatched a second case\u2026 unfortunately, this one has the exact same issue so it\u2019s definitely a design fault. For the price of the case, you\u2019d expect this fault to not be present. In addition, I believe for at least one of the cases, they had sent me a \u201creturned\u201d case as the packaging showed signs of \u201cfirst use\u201d. The other case had a great scratch deep in the leather on the back, so it was surprising to see how this passed their Quality Checks.Finally, when asked for an update from the second case, they didn\u2019t seem to want to work out why I was sent two dodgy cases and took me up immediately on my suggestion of a refund. It would have been nice to see what could have been done to resolve the fault but at least a refund was promptly issued. Unfortunately, I would not buy from this company again."

It's easy to straighten out, but annoying to do so constantly. There's very little grip on the bottom so it slid around a lot on my wood surface desk. And the flap was not as useful as I thought it would be. I would have liked to have an even larger size than the largest they offer. I ended up swapping for something larger and thinner with no flap that I like much better."

They both look so elegant with one on my nightstand and the other in my office. I don\u2019t notice any speed difference with charge time between the two at all. One negative is that they both charge way slower than just plugging it into my standard USB-C wall charger, especially for the Apple Watch. I\u2019m not sure whether it\u2019s affected the battery life yet. I hoping I can write an updated review after a couple of months.Also you definitely need both hands to remove your phone even though it claims you can use one hand. The base  isn\u2019t heavy enough. Will probably have to use double sided tape to mount it."

I've gone through many in my years, including fancy Vitra ones. All have had issues but this one is just right. I'll leave the details to reviews elsewhere but they are all right - the thing is lovely.I had one issue with the charging pad but, having contacted Journey to raise the issue, they replaced this immediately and for free. The replacement worked like a charm. What was particularly exceptional was the speed, efficiency, friendliness, and knowledge of the support/sales staff. It really was a breath of fresh air and something I'd almost forgotten is possible!I don't generally leave reviews but the quality of product and service meant I felt I should here. Thoroughly recommend."
