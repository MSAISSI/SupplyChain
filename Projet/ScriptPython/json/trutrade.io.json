          "Contenu": "There is still no information available about these bots. I left a review before and they had it removed. When I complained that YouTube has no info whatsoever about this bot ANYWHERE except by trutrade themselves, they find a guy named Guiellmo to start putting them up there, but he's the only one. Once again, no mention of price, trial runs, etc. If you know your bot works, let us try it out. If we don't like it, fine. Someone in the comments below mentioned $500 a month - and that's fair - especially considering they wanted 10 GRAND AT ONE POINT. I get they can possibly have a winning combination here, but all these steps we have to go through just to give an ounce of info is ridiculous.Edit: so the last time I left a review, you all took it down. I asked you for information, and you refuse to give it to me. I looked for information on my own, I couldn't find any. I complained that YouTube did not have any videos from anywhere by anyone except your company and then you found one single solitary person to put videos up on youtube.Now that you all have had that one taken down, you want to change the narrative and say that I'm mad because I can't get the robot for free. Nobody knows how much it cost! Say how much it cost right here in the review and all of this will be killed. If there's nothing wrong with your company, we should not have to do such stringent investigations to get more information about you. This is childish and this is why nobody is leaving you high reviews and the ones who are aren't giving any information about the price either because they are your employees."

Customer Support takes 2-3 days to respond and then they just make up an excuse not to help and then take another 2-3 days to respond by complaint about the customer. There is no management in place to take care of issues. I guess I have to file suit in AZ Superior Court to get help or a refund. They say they support a  Navy Seal Foundation but they won\u2019t even help a 100% disabled veteran  get the software they purchased up and running. AI Ripper purchase is not hands off and no VPS included despite sales videos stating such. This comes after I was to receive the Ripper AI with 5 nodes but due to a family emergency despite being told my package was on hold - I was downgraded to 2 nodes because the sale was over and my package being on hold was apparently not true.   I would love to leave an awesome review- especially if this software works like they claim but I have  been abandoned after signing up for $30K."

The reason provided for no pricing on the site is quoted as \u2018based on individual requirements'. They are offering products to retail traders, the fact they don\u2019t even have a baseline cost for an initial product should be concerning and would not be surprised if the cost varies for each individual for the same product during the initial call and getting a view of how much one is willing to give. Its astonishing they are charging $25k + for one of the products and the concept of the \u2018DRAMM\u2019 is nothing unique, its essentially a martingale approach with an ATM and that\u2019s worse, recipe for blowing up an account.All you need to do is look at the videos posted, no track record, likely trading demo and at points trading 25-30 contracts\u2026."

          "Contenu": "I purchased the Market Ripper bot from Trutrade.io last year after being allured by the YouTube videos of the bots winning trade after trade. I ended up paying thousands of dollars and it is a complete rip-off. It turns out that those videos only show the bot during rare and unpredictable market conditions. There is nothing special about their bots/strategies which have a terrible win rate in live markets. The actual automation trades like a drunk person. There is no real way to back test the strategy because it uses Renko bars (these bars trick the software into registering all trades as winning trades). I gave this company the benefit of the doubt and followed all of their instructions and quickly got ghosted by their customer support. After wasting several months trading (and losing) with the bot and following their instructions, it is clear that this is just a cash grab and all of the positive reviews are likely paid for. After doing even a small amount of research, it is obvious that automation is much more complicated than just buying a pre-made system. Unless you can properly back test the strategy yourself (using walk forward and monte carlo analysis), stay away."

Their customer service is great and they will help you one-on-one with their product so you can become successful with it.
