I have already BOUGHT THE PRO!!!are you people really that bad!   It appears so!Your support  portal,,, you know the one,, the one where you offer priority support  throws back another  cannot login due to invalid email or password lol...and it is also impossible to logout of your site and i have tried this on six different browsers and all the same!"
