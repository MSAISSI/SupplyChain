To make matters worse, the support team has been unresponsive, providing no explanation or assistance whatsoever. This situation has left me feeling cheated as they have not only cancelled my domain without justification but also kept my money. I initially chose this registrar because they offered the cheapest .me domain prices, but I will never use their services again, nor would I recommend them to anyone. Beware of Spaceship registrar, as they appear to be engaging in dishonest practices.I highly believe they want the domain for themselves because it was a very good name which related to the \"Threads\", the new popular social network. They cancelled mine to get it for themselves."

Their Transfer feature is not working yet, thats a big NO for me. I have to resell these Domains after 2 months.2. As Reported They Cancel your account and de register your domain. Even if my domains get unsold for an year, this thing would definitly make me to think that may be domain was of high value and they were the scammers."

I'm not yet a customer solely because there remains a small gap in trust. Who are these people? \"About Us\" would improve with a handful of real faces. I want a measure of stability -- hopefully this business will survive a few years at least; is there adequate funding & resolve? This is a tough field, with tight margins, can they survive? It is troublesome to migrate websites and email if their effort can't be sustained. Finally, I see (with a bit of research, though the extent of linkage is not clear) that Namecheap shut-down their Russian clients rather summarily. We live in volatile times. Will politics or a (foreign) government's policies disrupt my relationship with this firm? The imagery of a spaceship is borderless, but do they have any commitment to operating in a borderless manner?"

I had some reservations, but transferred a couple at first. I found initiating the transfer wasn't intuitive. I installed the transfer manager but no link to start a transfer. I couldn't find a help link inside launchpad so I went to the home page chat. Within a minute a nice tech was there to help me find where to start the transfer (which is from the home page). Those two transfers went well so the next day I initiated 13 more transfers, but had problem with the auth code being accepted (gave an error). I jumped on chat and again, a tech was with me in a minute and we worked it out. Everything has gone smoothly since. Now that my first batch has completed I navigated around and found the interface to be my favorite out of any registrar I have ever managed domains. I'm really liking spaceship.com and can't wait to have all my domains moved over. I highly recommend!"

          "Contenu": "Best Domain Management Site I've Ever Used, I used to be with Google Domains, now they were great.. Except they are now in an agreement with Squarespace and I can't promise myself that the price of my Domain won't go up significantly after the 1 year same domain price promise that they accepted, after going back and forth with the team over at Spaceship, I can say for certainty that I've no idea what the negative reviews are on about, if I have to give my honest opinion, don't let the bad reviews put you off at all because I've not experienced any issues ever since I made the jump to Spaceship, sure there\u2019s a few hitches here and there but nothing that can\u2019t be worked around and they are working on consistently adding new features and fixing bugs, for which you should check their Roadmap to see what might be coming next! Another thing I can say is that even if you haven't quite made the flight to the Spaceship yet and are worried about some things and have some questions, don't be scared to ask the support team over at Spaceship, I had a bunch of questions over a bunch of days before I transferred my domain, I asked a lot and ended up opening at least 5 tickets because I'd have a new question every 2 - 3 days, their support team always got back to me really quickly and were very nice, all of them are absolutely amazing and the hard effort is really paying off. Another thing I like about Spaceship is how open they are to the community, I never really see anyone such as Google or Microsoft365 Admin etc mention what features they are adding but Spaceship have a subpage for what's coming next ( Go to their website, scroll to the bottom, under \u201cAbout Spaceship\u201d press \u201cRoadmap\u201d ) and you as a consumer are able to select and vote which one you want to be implemented / worked on next and it's amazing. Honestly coming from Google Domains and moving to Spaceship has been an amazing experience. Now would I stay with them long term? Yes I would I feel like what they are doing now, they are becoming a mainstream Domain Management site and with their intuitive UX Site and always happy to help 24/7 support I can say for certainty that I won't ever move from them because simply I wouldn't get a better experience anywhere else, thank you Spaceship for existing, and thank you for your well curated customer support, you're all absolutely amazing and I simply couldn't ask for more other than keep working hard on those features and bug fixes, you\u2019re awesome and keep on at it :)"
