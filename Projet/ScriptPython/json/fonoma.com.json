The current exchange rate is 76% although I know no one ever sees the exact exchange. The exchange I received was 72%. For the 20CUC recarga, instead of costing approximately $26.30 + Service Fee, I was charged $36+ CAD by the time it comes to my account. In my opinion, that's very high. If I can find a more affordable, yet equally reliable service, I will be sure to change my habit of using Fonoma."
