          "Contenu": "DO NOT USE THIS WEBSITE! Site123 has been a colossal waste of money. They billed my credit card after I had cancelled my auto-renew. This is a practice a lot of dodgy providers use and is called \u201cnegative option marketing\u201d. They agreed to a partial refund after I made a dispute on PayPal. After the dispute was closed they did not issue a refund and ceased contact. I have had to reopen the dispute. Shameful and unethical practice. There are so many more affordable, easy to use and ethical website creators. Save your time and your money and don\u2019t use SITE123."

In my opinion this is dodgy and is how they make their money as they refuse to refund you. Honestly I would say spend your money elsewhere, their services are hardly worth the money you pay. There are plenty of user friendly affordable website platforms out there that are better than site123."

They keep saying that they are trying to solve this bug asap but so far there are no real solutions. Meanwhile, I'm being commercially damaged for not being able to publish the website properly and receiving pressure from my colleagues. Site123 support team replies fast, but solves nothing. So far, according to my experience, I strongly recommend people to find another website builder."

Cannot get a live person on the phone AT ALL for any reason. Also cannot speak to a supervisor, but you can send an email, which will not help me right now.

Compared to say Podia where I also host websites this is a huge huge weakness.Biggest downer is that I've had an issue with my mailing list (emails not sending) and they won't actually look at it on an individual basis - I was told if it's affecting other people they'll fix it, otherwise it's at the back of the list for them.Pretty disappointing when you pay them a lot of money and now I don't have a mailing list for my company!UPDATE:I emailed the company as they suggested below - 'ifno' is (hilariously) a typo which can't accept emails, so I also emailed 'info@' instead which did work. (They have since updated their comment to correct their typo)They haven't responded to my email - I have downgraded my review therefore to one star because this is more of the terrible service that I've been experiencing.Update.I can confirm that after this update they have responded now."

A customer trying to create an order has just contacted me and I am getting the run around again. My website can currently be viewed on some platforms (MAC, iPad, Samsung phone) but when I try to view it on my iPhone or my customer tried on her tablet or phone it won't load. This is not the first time this has happened. I have lost so many sales because of SITE123"

I was given a discount of 40% to upgrade professional or Gold . I picked professional package to use which was 40% of $16 a month original price without discount, which totol came to 108, so the time was passed I never say time was up. I reach out same day and person say can give me 10% discount but wait the original price went from $16 to $26 for professional. So now I got jacked up price with discount of joke if I never screen shot it time I saw it I would think I'm crazy. I send to them they need write someone so I delete account and use back a referred link but now account is blocked because they save you information , I was told 24-72 hours but time well passed they still have my email stored though I deleted account and not getting response from anyone. Customer support send me to write someone else that never replies lol . The bad start shows me what bad terrible customer service they have no joke. It's terrible they really slow and don't care. I even check reviews just before I write this and it's like once you have a problem that need support you are done for just go to a different company. \ud83d\ude05"

          "Contenu": "I had to change my review once again because dealing with Benjamin the technical support online, I am finding they do not know how to assist with technical issues in transferring of a web domain nor are they interested in keeping customers with SITE123. After speaking with Thomas for the past week, I thought I had my issue of domain transfer resolved. However, I still cannot pull up my website through Site123 like I thought. I noticed my webpage did not pull up online. Therefore, I reached out to my old provider to ensure they deactivated my domain. In doing so, they instructed me that SITE 123 needs to reset the DNS so that my website could go live with their web platform. However, Benjamin explained that it was live and could be seen online and that there was nothing SITE 123 needed to do. I explained I would have to get a return of my money since my site was not going live. He chatted that the email address and gave me the number to call to deactivate my account. Therefore, SITE 123 will be losing business today because the online chat team does not know how to assist. You can only reach SITE123 technical team via online chat. This is a terrible way to do business when it comes to IT support. Although the sites platform is easy to set up, you get no technical support from this company because everything is done online. You never get a live voice and if the person you are working with is not available you will get a terrible representative like Benjamin that cannot assist, is very rude, and does not have interest in promptly assisting customers. At the end of the day, this situation has caused me to lose business because I cannot get my domain transferred. Very upset!"

Further, the refund was issued via PayPal after I contacted them and filed a complaint regarding the charges. The refund was from PayPal, not Site123. My opinion of Site123 remains unchanged. Anyone looking for a website builder would do well to look elsewhere. There are plenty of options. Do your homework. ORIGINAL POST - This site is based in Israel and do not follow the laws of US or Canada and take advantage of their location with respect to unauthorized charges. My account was auto charged despite my advising Site123 that I did not wish to Rene and despite my account settings have their \u201cauto-renew\u201d option set to \u201cdisabled\u201d. They charged my card anyway then refuse to refund the money. I now have to try to get the credit card co/paypal to reverse charges. Avoid this service. They are a scam and will take your money."

In charging a sales tax, I discovered that the tax didn't show up as a detail line along with the cost of each book and shipping, so the calculated total did not include the tax. Then, on the payment page, the charged amount included the tax. Surprise!!!! I reported this problem and was assigned a trouble ticket number LPvsg2wm. On follow-up inquiries to see where my issue stood, I was told that my issue was thrown in with all other projects and developments. I couldn't get a commitment as to how long it would take. I suggested two days, two weeks, two months, two years. They had no idea. There seemed to be a much stronger effort to develop new templates and support getting new business than to support the business they already had. I gave up and requested a refund.Supplemental Review:I would like to buy back in, but you still haven't addressed the issue of leaving customers hanging and wondering if their issue will ever be addressed. Communicate, communicate, communicate. When you address this communication issue positively, I'll change my 2 stars to 5 stars and my review title to \"Great Company with Super Customer Support.\""

Suddenly today, a long time later, I try to update my website and it won't allow it unless I pay for an upgrade. They tell me I'm way over, and they don't know why it would have allowed me to add so much content. Well, I have an idea. Because now that I have business cards printed and the website all made it's going to be a lot harder to change to another service. But they underestimate my stubbornness and my cheapness."

I have spent hours with their agents and more that half of the time spent has been highly unsatisfactory leaving my issues unresolved.

Moreover, there are several other platforms on the Internet that  switch off the subscription if the user doesn't manually pay for the subscription to continue.

This problem is of utmost importance to me, as it directly affects the ability of my customers to view and purchase my products.The specific concern is related to the zooming functionality for digital images on mobile devices. As an essential part of my product offering, it is crucial that customers are able to zoom in and examine the details of the digital images before making a purchase. Unfortunately, I have noticed that on mobile devices, the zooming feature does not seem to be functioning as intended. This limitation is concerning because it prevents potential customers from being able to read and understand the content contained within the digital packs.I would greatly appreciate it if you could allocate some time to investigate and resolve this issue as soon as possible. waiting for your response"

Adding pictures, text boxes and other elements on the site is very limited and has to be done only in the framework of the existing templates. If there's no template for your idea of the site it's not really possible to have enough creative freedom to drag things where you want them to be. Great and quick customer support.Overall: An easy choice and a good option for a starter online shop or other small business. But the lack of freedom makes me want to look at other alternatives for the future."

Cannot upload videos while sending email on a new message. We need to be able to upload you tube videos or copy embedded code and insert into our content to attract visitors.2. Maximum emails can be sent a month is only 10000 email. Need to increase this to 20,000 emails as a minimum.3. I need to be able to edit my website not through site123 tagging.These are the improvements required for now in my opinion."

I have to dig around to find what I need or hunt thru the website to locate how to do something.  Personally I wish that I could change the color of the texts in areas that I want it to pop out for my customers. Haven't been able to find that if it's even supported."

And the sharing of some snips/screenshots both ways helped me a lot bringing domain-website and emails together! KRGert"

Was told it would take 48 hours. Unfortunately, it took 240 hours (no joke) before someone on the other end finally said it will be fixed in 40 minutes -- and it was. I had already posted a negative review, and someone  from Site123 reached to make sure everything was ok (but only after negative review - I wish they had been more proactive earlier). I ran into a second issue which they checked immediately for me and it caused me to realize the situation was on my end. So, I appreciate their follow up and the matter was resolved. The only reason they don't get 5 stars is because of how long it took to get to the bottom of things."

This was to be my first web site. I found SITE123 to be different to anywhere else. There web based app was very intuitive and free which was very attractive. Sure it's not perfect but my skills aren't either. Being an older person (approaching 80) my short term memory isn't what  it used to be but I found that what I needed to do in compiling a website was easy to follow. As I got into it more ideas started happening. The result turned out to be better than I expected it to be. The cost factor was very important as I was compiling the website for my  small local Presbyterian Church without a budget. Using my own limited resources I opted for the 5 year Professional deal which was surprisingly cost affective.Nothings perfect hence the 4 star review and some of the staff need to get a few more lessons on customer relation but I generally ignored that having been in sales myself for many years. We all have bad days. I was to use a domain that I had previously purchased wanting to get a site in the new .au TLD. I had no Idea how to transfer it but I was talked through it in an efficient manner.  Yes, I would rate SITE123 as a candidate for your short, It came out tops for me it could well be the same for you."
