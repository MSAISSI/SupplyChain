It buzzed more than a bee hive and that's because it had high and uneven frets from fret 12 to 24. Something that would have been noticed if a basic setup was done, because low E to G buzzed on the open notes. You would think that they would check that an $1100 guitar was playable before shipping it out, but unfortunately for me they did not. The back-plate was scratched up a good bit as well, but to be fair, this could of been caused during shipping. Also the finish had what felt like grains of sand underneath it. I did get a full refund and the service rep I dealt with was responsive, but the entire process was painfully slow. This was a bad experience for me & I will not buy from here again."

I left a message with my order and phone number. An hour later I left a second message. The messages were DO Not ship till you talk to me. No one returned my call. Later that day I received an email my guitar had shipped, in spite of my instructions not to. I emailed Music Store Live to retrieve the guitar which they did. When they finally responded about the delay and no communications they made all types of excuses for their poor business practices. I ordered the same guitar at a better price from Kraft Music and had it in 3 days with outstanding customer service."

It was not. Also, the 5 way switch was not even functional. I find it hard to believe it quit working during shipment but it was never checked. Also the set up was almost unplayable. I had to take the guitar to my own repair shop to have the switch changed and set up. They did however tell me they would refund the cost of having the switch repaired but who wants to take a brand new $1K guitar to get fixed before it can even be played. The guys were polite and nice enough but I don\u2019t think their \u201cin house tech\u201d is doing exactly what he says he\u2019s doing. This is my third purchase from them but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll take another chance or not. Maybe, time will tell. Again Ben was polite and wanted to make it right.

Phone call with them before purchase was good, would like to have a few more interactions before I can rate 5 stars."

I'll have to wait until I change the strings to change the tape. It's minor but I feel like this should have been caught in the set up and inspection before it was packed and shipped. It's not worth a full point rating, I would rate 4&1/2 stars if I could."

Wish they had posted several different wood grains and noted that it would be at random.  Instead they had every possible angle of the gorgeous guitar, but that's not what I received at all.  My bad I guess.  But shame on you for not being transparent about that.  Oh well.  Company did great otherwise.  :)"

The return/tech people were stubborn and hard headed.However, Fernando Fajardo, who was the head of this, was great and so understanding, and sent a replacement without question.Sometimes, as the customer you need to speak up when you're not being treated fairly.

I wanted to go with a vender in California near me so that I could get my drums sooner than later. I made an offer to Ben and he was willing to go for it and send the drums out immediately. I had them within 3 days.. Next  I ordered more goodies for my drum kit and the same great service ensued. I couldn't be more pleased."

YMMV, but my personal experience was flawless. I've remotely purchased a number of guitars from Sweetwater and this purchase interaction with musicstorelive.com was easily on par with Sweetwater. The guitar: Intonation of the guitar out of the box was spot on. Customer rep said they do a \"setup\" prior to purchase and the guitar plays perfectly in tune, frets are silky smooth. Great guitar, great seller."
