There are many warnings about buying Handshake domain names and how there are no refunds, there is nothing scammy or \"disgusting\" about it.-- Many warning??? No, you design to cheat, that is your bad.What's disgusting is leaving a one star review due to your own inability to pay attention to clear warnings while checking out.--I am able to understand what domain means in common sense. You sell blockchain nonsense at no cost to cheat your customers."

I am taking all of my business elsewhere because your mail service deleted emails and your employees (Philip) don't want to do their jobs to recover the emails. They are making me repeat myself while blaming other carriers which I don't use as they've been told repeatedly. I told him I want a refund for the URLs I paid for before they were set to expire but he blew that off and just sent me a link to move my URLs elsewhere. So much for your self proclaimed great customer care. >:-(UPDATE:18 days after reporting the problem and 7 days after their response to my negative Trust review, ABSOLUTELY NO ONE from the Admin Team ever contacted me after repeated requests and NOTHING was done to find the emails that disappeared from the email service I was paying for Porkbun to provide! A customer should not be asked 4 different times by 4 different employees that are not in the admin team, the same questions over and over, just to be blown off at the end. I stated that I'd be taking my business elsewhere if the missing email issue wasn't resolved. Instead of resolving it, Philip the head support manager sent me a link to transfer my business elsewhere. I will be reporting this to the BBB as well as the Attorney General Consumer Affairs as this is a paid service I paid for and your employees don't want to do the tedious work of recouping the emails that disappeared.UPDATE: Spoke with India and told her my issue and that I needed to talk to someone above Philip the Support Manager as my complaint was about him. She called me back a few minutes later after she reached out to other members in her group and said they weren't going to be able to do anything about the emails their company lost AND that I could NOT speak to anyone above Philip to complain about his poor customer service.She also stated that they would NOT refund my money for 4 of my domain names that I was going to transfer from their service WHICH were paid for a week ago, and haven't expired before needing to be renewed. I have almost $200 of domain URLs and email service I was paying yearly for which they are losing because of the poor service.TOTALLY FALSE ADVERTISEMENT ABOUT MIND BLOWING CUSTOMER SERVICE! I'm reporting this company to the BBB and the Attorney General's Consumer Affairs department."

At the same time, you complain to trustpilot about bad and truthful reviews, and apparently you write positive ones to yourself. If you go to other popular sites like reddit or just Google, it's obvious that many people don't like you there. So piece reviews here from several people are a drop in the bucket. I'm sure there are a lot more such reviews, you're just trying to delete them.I will be extremely surprised if this review is not deleted. Simply because you are trying to play against the generally accepted norms of morality. However, the result of your actions is dust in the eyes of potential consumers.

I own a web design company so they'll lose all my business and I won't be referring anyone or any clients to them any longer. dan at bestwebdesignlasvegas.com>>>Response: I have a partnership with kohls that allows me to sell their product. And offer customers of kohls to use their rewards, kohls card etc. Kohls is aware of the site and if they had a problem they would let me know. Your suspension is not acceptable. I will be transferring my domain and will continue my partnership with kohls elsewhere."

Therefore your policy of one credit card per account is useless. Do not store or link credit cards to one account. Allow to pay through any card or process. In India, any credit card has a two factor authentication (e.g. OTP to phone). So one can't use anyone else's card and comit fraud."

I am unable to check out.I already verified my email, phone number and credit card, so i contacted Support again. Same as before they replied after 24hours, they want me to verify my identification with Veriff.com. So i did! After verification i sent message to support and waited another 24 hours for reply.Finally i can click checkout button.Guess what? i still can not pay with my already verified credit card, can not add my bank details ( because my account must be older than 36500days to link bank ?) even can pay with crypto because i`m not VERIFIED. actually i just did verification, and waited for days to reply.Just give up porkbun. and purchased that domain from another registrar but with 1 cent additional price"

This is how the industry works today and this is how to makes business today. Nobody care about the founder of the domain... because today everything is business and profits like they said your loss is my win, \"Your death is my Life\". So I have the right for my own opinion for the beautiful world of business of domain name industry and how works today. Have a nice day !!!"

That was my case. Why do I have to pay for the third-party plugin to migrate to Porkbun? It doesn't make sense... Also, the support staff was rather irritated than supportive. I decided to stay with my current hosting company which is more customer centerd and has support available 24/7. If you want just a simple domain name provider, it does the job but if you face problems the support is email only and worse than the others."

Unfortunately, they have recently added a feature which is very distasteful - automatic enrollment in auto-pay on domain registrations. You simply cannot complete a payment without enrolling in auto-pay. Yes, they say (in the fine print) that they provide a method to later opt-out of auto-pay, but this has things exactly backwards. It should not require a customer to opt-out of automatic payment without having first consciously opted-in.I understand the benefits of auto-pay for vendors, but it should still remain as an opt-in option, not an \"opt-out (if you even knew we opted you in) deal\"Now, I'm going to have to re-evaluate my choice of registrars. The shine on my otherwise five-stars opinion has faded..A better option on their part would have been to offer a positive incentive for folks to enroll in auto-pay. They have numerous incentive deals already. They should just put a positive incentive on auto-pay, too"

This happened to me in the past where google detected a false positive and Porkbun suspended the domain. It was clearly a false positive since I didn't modify the website whatsoever and submitted it back to google and it was approved as being clean with nothing wrong; this took maybe a few hours to 1 day for google to verify. Porkbun left the domain suspended for days and wasn't very informative at the time because it was the weekend and abuse department was only monday to friday. This I found to just be a terrible business practise, i understand the need to remove abuse but the steps in place at the time of it happening to me need to be changed as it seems like there was no human intervention or double check and my domain was disabled just because of an automated google warning.

I know how to manage domains.After reading glowing reviews, Porkbun had me sold, I was just about to transfer all my domains to Porkbun, but when I happen to discover that catch-all email forwarding was not provided I stopped. Catch-all forwarding is a very important facility that most email users would find useful and many power users will eventually require.Porkbun's excuse is that is stresses their servers, so I was reluctant to believe that. I've had no problem with previous registrars, and I've managed to stop spam after it arises. It's a lot of hassle setting up email address and preventing spam without a catch-all forwarding facility.Porkbun's solution is to disable that altogether, for the benefit of their own servers, which makes me think they don't have very good infrastructure, or are on the cheap with low grade AWS hosting. Really, their reason for not offering catch-all's is lame and i transferred my domains elswhere.One thing I am upset about is that Porkbun never makes it clear on their promotionals or signup pages that catch-all is not provided, I had to find out from Reddit forums. Gotta love reddit."

I was assured it was because of how quickly they're growing, and it doesn't impact their hosting at all. Super. Load. Of. Crap. My site's not even done yet, has less than 4 products on it, css is minified, everything is compressed and it is still taking 5 seconds before the FIRST ping! I work on sites daily (SEO) and I have never experienced such a slow site. (Hello, 1997?) I sent it to my web dev and he won't even touch it until I switch hosting providers, because he says there's nothing he can do until I get new hosting (it's not worth it to try, apparently, it's that bad.)When I emailed in today, I was told that the 'hosting isn't for everyone' and is a 'one size fits all.' Uhh. That would have been nice to mention before I bought my 4 domains through PorkBun, especially when I specifically asked. Cannot recommend. And I'm locked into their hosting for 2 months apparently. So I guess I can launch my new site (with the products i've worked tirelessly on for 8 months) in 2 more months... after I switch hosting.

After I disclosed my IP address they ghosted me! I send them another email the next day but they didn't answer again. Very unprofessional!I managed to successfully create an account after three days from another computer at home. I think I got the reason why it wasn't working in the first place: It was because of the password which contained Extended ASCII characters! At least give the user a message that they should pick a password without them instead of just throwing \"403 Forbidden\" on a blank page!But it doesn't end here. After I purchased my domain for two years I logged out for a while and then tried to log back in. Password didn't work! My intuition tells me it's because it starts with a single quotation mark (it was generated randomly by the password manager). Not even regular ASCII is handled properly in the backend! I did manage to change my password and it went ok from there on, but it took me 3 days of tinkering just to register an account. You shouldn't need to pick a simpler (and thus more crackable) password just to please a dysfunctional form backend.Other bad things: The website is mess. The \"Contact Us\" link in the footer is just a blank javascript. That's just laughable (in a sad way).Good things: Although they ditched me after a short correspondence, the initial response was pretty quick. Sadly, this and the competitive pricing are pretty much the only good things about Porkbun. It does have a lot of potential but I'm going to rate it for what it is and not for what it could be.Honestly the review should've been one star but I'm trying as hard as I can to be objective."

We love porkbun, however, Eddie didn\u2019t understand.See below Hi. re sos.goldYouwhen going to www. sos.goldEddie joined the chatEddieHelloYouIt says 404 (006)pixie proxy, no wildcard URL forwarding configured. Can you tell me how to fix this, please?EddieIt looks like you setup a URL forwarder and have a previous wildcard record set, however the Wildcard option is setup for the current forward you have setupEddieYou'll want to resetup the forwarder and select the \" Use wildcard URL forwarding\" as wellYouSo, it loads when you go to sos.gold but when you go to www. sos.gold it fails? Please can you fix it? ThanksEddieAs I said, you'll need to recreate the URL forwarder and make sure \"Use wildcard URL forwarding\" is checked if you want it to work for any subdomains.YouAs I said, I\u2019ve done it before. But is still not working. Can you fix it for me, please?EddieUnfortunately it's not created correctly, you need to create it again but making sure that. checkbox is checked so that it will work on any subdomainsYouPlease kindly create it for me. Thanks.YouIf I do that, the images don\u2019t load.EddieThe images don't load?YouYes if I do as you say, it doesn\u2019t load images. That\u2019s why please kindly assist and try to fix it. ThanksEddieWhat images are you referring to? I'm not understanding.YouWebsite imagesEddieThe URL forwarder shouldn't have any impact on your website's images, you'll just want to recreate the URL forwarder and make sure that box is checked so that any subdomains will forward on as well as the root domainYouPlease see myYoumy above replies, you\u2019ll see that I\u2019ve done that but the website images don\u2019t load in that case. Kindly fix the issues for me. Thank you.EddieAgain, the forwarder doesn't have any control over what is loaded at the destination URL. The issue is you do not have Wildcard forwarding enabled for the forwarder you setup, you just need to recreate it and then it will load correctly for WWW so long as you check the \"Use wildcard URL forwarding\" option as I have said aboveYouAgain, I\u2019ve done that before and it impacts on the images not being displayed.EddieUnfortunately you will need to do it againEddieIf you setup the URL forwarder again, making sure the \"use wildcard\" option is checked, it will probably forward for your www subdomain and any other subdomainsYouUnfortunately, I have already said, I\u2019ve done that and it doesn\u2019t load the images.EddieI'm not seeing that you've recreated the forward, please try recreating the forward as I have instructedYouPlease read my historical replies above \u23cf\ufe0fEddie ended the chatReview edit:Thank you for your reply.We find part of your reply as a weak excuse.The employee with highest reviews should be monitored more. Also, it\u2019s not just about us, make sure at all times Eddie is performing to highest standards.Thank you."

Like most other companies in the registrar space, unfortunately Pork Bun is just meh. I am sure the networking stuff behind the scenes works great...I hope, but coming from Google, this UI/UX is just a sad disappointment and downgrade.  - Streamlined domain search, Google Domains was much better at giving suggestions and presenting the myriad of domain results to the user. Pork Bun feels unintuitive and endless scrolling of the same results. - \"Refresh the page\" in 2023 should not be a thing. The UI should refresh the page when it knows transactions and updates are complete. -  The user's list of purchased domains looks like a clone of 90s Hosting control panels. - The DNS management loads in a modal and has horrible UX. This might seem like nitpicking, but this is what made Google Domains so attractive, they did one thing and did it extremely well. I hope one of these days somebody comes along and just does domain management for software engineers the right way."

While yes, Porkbun still offers I'd say some of if not the best first year prices, things have changed. Companies have better after first year pricing. But I must say for the price, the quality of the domain management is some of the best. However, I'm kind of disappointed that they do not offer live chat, if they do I can never seem to find them online. E-Mail is fast. But other registrars even cheap ones offer live chat. I like the Cloudflare DNS thing they do in domain management. DNS records are smooth sailing too. Nameservers change fast too. So I'd say price, and support is where Porkbun can do better.Edit feel its annoying and dumb that they just auto renew your mail plans with no option to turn off auto renewal."

So there is about a month when other global Whois servers show your domain as expired. The only Whois server that will show it in date is their one. That is what I mean by faking the renewal.No matter how much I insist they process the renewal they refuse. The only option is to get a transfer code and transfer the domain to keep it safe.And then they give a refund because the transfer is for that year and not for the next year. Because it was not actually renewed.And there is no option to manually renew it on their website in this \"Autorenewal Period\" because the website pretends it has already been renewed. Hence me calling it a fake renewal."

I inquired about paying with ACH (bank account) to get a lower price for each domain. Again, have to contact support. I wait for them to verify my bank account, which takes 2 days. Then, instead of just having a button for ACH at checkout, I have to buy credits in advance and wait for them to be made available, which took five days. In the meantime, I wanted to register a new domain. I could add it to my cart, but I had to wait until the credits were available before I could pay. I could not charge my credit card unless I canceled the ACH-only setting, which requires that I ... yeah ... contact support. It was Sunday evening, so had to wait another day. They do respond quickly during business hours, but I tend to do things outside business hours. So, very inconvenient. I wish things were more automatic. Sadly, they are raising prices again, but it's apparently industry-wide. The prices are still much better than my last registrar."

          "Contenu": "I purchased a domain from them due to the cheap price. UI isn't as polished as other domain providers out there but it was manageable and functional.When I was setting up Zoho mail on my domain, I found a bug where it doesn't save MX records when the host is set to \"@\". Their documentation claims that it should support it, but actually throws an error when you add MX records with an \"@\" host. I expected the MX record to be added as \"@.mydomain.com\", but instead only shows \"mydomain.com\". After 2 hours, I couldn't set up my Zoho mail properly so I looked for alternatives.I thought that this \"bug\" was a ploy to get me to purchase their email hosting service... so I bought it for $24 AUD / year (they only do bulk billing). I set up their email hosting as specified in their documentation... and everything worked except for the automated acknowledgement email I send whenever my support inbox receives an email.When an email is sent to my support inbox, the automated response only comes in if the webmail UI is opened. When the automated email is sent to the customer, it goes to the spam folder instead of their inbox. I sent an email to Porkbun's customer support to talk about this. They said that my email hosting is set up correctly in my domain. I gave information about where the issue is but they never got back to me. It's been 2 weeks!TLDR; If you're purchasing a domain and you don't need to support email hosting in the future, use Porkbun. If not, don't use this service due to inaccurate documentation and buggy email hosting."

Last week I had a request to submit ID - no problem and it was done using their automated system within 24 hours. Yesterday I had a mail to say they hadn't heard back and the account was at risk of suspension. Again, I've no problem with that and immediately mailed back to say it had in fact been completed.Today I've gone to register more domains for my clients and received a message to say the account was now suspended. No investigation or mails to me to say it hadn't actually been received - just a straight suspension of the profile. To treat a client who has put through so much business this way is beyond belief. I'm hoping that this piece of feedback may speed up a response to the 2 mails that I'm yet to hear back on...Edit updated to 3 stars - I love the simplicity of the site and prices but this experience leaves a bitter taste. I resolved the issue myself by contacting livechat who undid the suspension but throughout the conversation offered no apology."

          "Contenu": "So far I have really liked porkbun, its has come with a lot of high praise from people I trust. However there are areas I really want to improve. Namely around discovery.I am part of the google domains diaspora, and on their platform discovery was fantastic. The better your discovery gets the more domains I will buy :)One thing that would be nice is when searching if you had a big list of ~100-200 of the top selling domains as suggestions for the query.Currently it feels like I have to wade through so many crappy ones. Every search I make starts with .boston. I am not from boston, dont live in boston, never want to. I am never ever ever going to buy a .boston domain.It would also be nicer if the visual queues for what is available and what isn't were made clearer and easier to browse. Its feels like that information should be directly next to the domain name so that when the reader browses their eyes don't have to scan as much."

It had been a while since I worked on anything so I didn't know. I had a really hard time telling if I was even in my account. It was just weird. In fact it looked like I was signed out. I should not have to wonder. I really don't like the way their site functions. It also got hung up with a spinning pig tail but that could be a browser issue."

When domain order started coming in with many name requests things got out of control pretty quick. That was just a service we offered, and no charge, it seemed a little absurd the amount of requests. I can imagine my old team when I see you guys if we had stuck with it. You run a clean, performance gui and I have never experienced an error. Prices are reasonable and often the best. The personal edge says a lot. I appreciate your team and will continue to pass the word."

You will also easily be able know how much you'll pay and how to avoid having to pay a fee.On a more technical note, Porkbun supports DNSSEC, CAA records and the ALIAS record too.ALIAS isn't really a DNS record type, but rather a \"reverse-proxy\" for another DNS record - cans be any record type."
