          "Contenu": "While customer service was A+, the drive sent reports 100% usage at less than a MB/s transfer rate. By far the worst drive I have ever used. 1/600th of the max possible speed is sad. I understand that 600Mbps is sequential perfect world performance, but I get better results on any other drive, and this is an SSHD! Dissapointed to say the leastUpdate* drive solutions emailed me begging for a better review, and tried to justify selling bad drives. If I bought a lemon car from a car dealership, I wouldn't blame the manufacturer I would blame the company that chose to sell faulty hardware.Then, they decided to publicly say my hardware is the problem, not the drive they sent. Even if I had a hardware problem, this drive does not perform. You are a STORAGE company. If the STORAGE you sell is faulty, it's your fault. My review originally reflected on both the drive and the company, and I said the company is solid. I change my mind. Any company this desperate for good reviews on failing performance is sad. I do not recommend this company, and I will not return the drive because I'm confident they would just sell it again to another buyer while claiming it is functional. Overall, stop begging for better reviews, it makes you look bad and has convinced me to never recommend them again to anyone.The reply from the company implied that the products they sell have nothing to do with their company. I disagree. For another comparison, imagine ordering a pizza and it's delivered burnt to a crisp, and the pizza place says \"Well... Really you should be reviewing the flour from the company we bought from, it's not our fault it's bad!\" I really don't care if your company doesn't have perfect reviews, you obviously are begging/possibly bribing for good reviews and that's a you problem. Stop bothering me. Tired of companies desperate to look good at any cost. Just check their reply(if they don't change it). They believe that they are independent of the services they provide, but that's not how the world works.Once again, you selling bad product DOES reflect badly on you, and it's really not my problem to make you look better than you are."

I did and put it on disc. I tried that and have now lost all my files on my hard drive. When I called back and spoke to  someone in sales they agreed that the disc should not have been included with the kit and forwarded me to tech support. They advised me to retry the system but by then everything was already lost and there was no advice on what to do. The computer reads: operating system not found. I am now out the $55.00 for purchase and shipping of the kit and now need to purchase windows 7 professional to reinstate my computer and then deal with lost files. I have installed hard drives to my other computers with no problems, so to say I am completely disappointed is an understatement. I would strongly NOT recommend this product to anyone!!"

I let the customer service girl know that their website needed to be updated, since it showed a 9.5 mm size. \r I let the girl know about some other problems with the order and from the way she responded to me, I could tell she thought my concerns were silly! \r The other concerns were: \r 1. On the part of the invoice that was on the package and showed my mailing address - right under my name was my e-mail address and right under my mailing address, was my phone number! I don't appreciate my e-mail address and phone number being right there where the whole world can see them!!! It makes me think that this company is not being careful with my banking info either!!! I've never in my 56 years - had a company put my e-mail address and phone number right there on the package - where anybody can see them!!! (and I've ordered online a lot!)\r 2. The bubble wrap that my hard drive was in, was NOT taped at the ends!!!\r 3. Their phone number was NOT on the packing slip!!!\r Talk about NOT paying attention to detail! Well, these details have made up my mind to NOT order from them ever again! This was my FIRST AND LAST order with this company!!!"

Had to call the HD manufacturer directly to realize there was no way around the issue. Now I am too far down the line to return the unit. Got stuck with it and am yet to figure out a solution.

          "Contenu": "I ordered a 2 TB SATA drive \"compatible\" with my wife's Dell Laptop when there were signs of imminent disk failure on December 21, 2014.  It arrived promptly a few days later.  Drive Solutions' FAQs told me that there was likely to be a small interposer between most laptops' drives and their disk interface itself.  That was a great help when I saw that it needed to be taken off the old drive and put onto the new one before installing the new drive.\r I had many questions about their software offering to help in migrating the data to the new drive, so I e-mailed Drive Solutions with them, but I immediately got a reply that advised me to phone them because it would take several days to get a response from their technical support team by e-mail.  It is now 16 days later and I STILL have not gotten an answer to my e-mail. That's not very good customer service.\r Also, their phone system SUCKS big-time! I could not get through after 3 work days of trying (about 50 times), so I started looking elsewhere for answers.  Eventually, I found the manufacturer of the gadget that Drive Solutions offered, and then found a number of choices from Apricorn including the full manuals for the Apricorn software and a hardware gadget which I eventually bought (one of the Apricorn offerings) and tried using it to migrate the data.  Nobody and nothing ever told me that the Apricorn product (interface, software and enclosure) could NOT handle a situation where even ONE bad sector existed on the source drive.  At least Apricorn DID answer their phone (on my FIRST try) and I got the lowdown on that problem but only after wasting 3 full days trying to make the product do what it was NOT going to ever do.\r I did eventually got all the content onto the replacement drive (another WEEK of time, gone) but only because I had a recent Windows \"System Save\" on an external hard drive, a Dell Recovery disk, an installable DVD with Dell's OEM version of Windows/7 and an up-to-date backup of ALL the data files on separate external hard drives.\r This is not for the faint-of-heart, but a data recovery vendor may not have the patience I did and, if they tried at all, would have cost MUCH more money that I eventually spent or just have said \"too bad\"."

A diagram; an explanation of setting up the drive - or any drive for that matter; a resource to go to for more in-depth help. Fortunately I had enough experience to install and set up the drive myself. And as I said, the drive is working just fine."

My only suggestion is really to the manufacturer of the data transfer part...should either answer their help line quickly or state on package that transferring data from a damaged hard drive is not recommended. This may seem elementary to most, but a movie like myself wanted confirmation."

They called me within a couple of hours and provided an answer. It just so happened that they did not have in stock the entry-level hard drive in stock so they UPGRADED the order to a pro-level AT THE SAME PRICE. The amazing aspect of this is they resolved the issue the same day. I only wish that other mail-order companies would learn from this fantastic example of really outstanding service."
