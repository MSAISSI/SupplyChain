          "Contenu": "They logged in my BDO account and the runner sold 160 mil in crons off my account and sold a leyton's 99 mil necklace. When I asked where they stored it, they said they needed it for the runs but there was no transaction history. They said they would pay me back after the runs were over. Now when confronted the runner said it was only 500, I showed a screenshot of the 1500 crons and the manager changed it to 1200-1500. Then I said I gave a screenshot of it 2080 crons and the manager was like \"I only know what I'm told\". Their solution was that I sell the items they got from the run to pay myself back lol.. To pay myself back with the promotional in the package that said \"all items are yours\". They don't tell you they will empy you out before they pay you back with the gear. The deceptive part is that they will avoid the question \"do you use my items to level?\" then they will make it seem like it takes 160 mil to level, as if killing monsters costs 160mil silver to repair your gear. Don't trust these runners without having pictures in advance. I've been a vip on my main for 2 years and their eso service is great, but their BDO service is deceptive, aswell as the gall of the worker to tell me to pay myself back with the items dropped."

          "Contenu": "Current date: 3/3/2023Armada is now accusing me of either posting a fake review or lying about my experience. Hope everyone reading this avoids this \"company\" like the plague; your response speaks volumes, Armada.Current date: 3/1/2023 Nearly 2 years after this review I got an email saying that the review may be taken down for undisclosed reasons. This action has to be initiated from Armada's end. 2 years later they still want to scrub my experience from the internet lol. Screw you guys, I gave you 3 stars before but this petty nonsense is taking you down two more.Note: Bottom section added upon compensation given for poor serviceBought a power leveling boost for 2 hours. Their website said that their boost starts within 15-30 minutes. 2 hours of waiting later, I decided to reach out on discord and check my order status. They told me that they needed my server and faction to begin but never reached out for that information and never asked for it when I purchased the service. I gave them the missing information, and I was told there was no ETA on when my boost would start, only that it would be \"hours\". Another 7 hours go by and I'm told they're ready for me and want my login info. Nowhere on their site does it say that they needed this. When I went to buy 2 hours worth of boosting, I assumed that I'd be buying 2 hours of a dungeon-spammer's time to run me through some dungeons. Nope, they don't allow self-pilots under any circumstance. I eventually gave in and sent them my account info under the condition that they stream the boost for me. Good lord was this stream hard to watch. He did not do ZG boosting like any sane person would. He just started questing right where I had left off. He was using the wrong paladin seal, aura, blessing, and clearly did not understand how to play a paladin efficiently.  I honestly felt bad for the guy, no joke. That is until he started using the consumables I had stockpiled in my bags for TBC launch while questing. I watched him for the full 2 hours and he finished with an extra 60% xp into lvl 59Note: After writing this review I was contacted by someone from Armada who apologized about the poor service. I was refunded the money I spent, was told that they'd change their service description on the website, and compensated with a respectable amount of gold due to the booster using my consumables."

They sometimes will book stuff with teams that are \"to tired.\" i.e. Currently on day 3 of ilvl boost because team is to tired to do more then 3 runs a day for M+. I was told it would be done 3 days ago, and here we are waiting again for them to be ready. Armada has several agents i believe and some are just ready to book for the money and not the customer."

I also ordered a carry through a veteran dungeon that I had trouble finding a group for otherwise and the team was incredibly professional, though also quite friendly.  They actually did my carry a bit earlier than anticipated, which was a pleasant surprise!  Like I said, my biggest concern going in was security- I was very skeptical about the legitimacy of this service, but I am very happy to say that the service is quite secure, reliable, and professional!"

Probably one of the best booting sites out they show men and women equal service quality and don\u2019t try to rip you off by over charging or anything"
