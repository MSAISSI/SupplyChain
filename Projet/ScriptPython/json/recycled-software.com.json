The costs I paid for the product key here are identical as if purchase officially at Microsoft online.Same with Win Pro product key, try to upgrade from Home but key isn't approved for upgrade to Win Pro, hence all b*llsh*t.I also contact them and ask for help or alternative measures, their support doesn't response at all.Very disappointing and huge waste of time and money here and do not buy!!

The money needs to be returned and we have reported to Microsoft that you are a scam site ripping people off. i paid $50 odd dollars only to be told the key is false and in use. I have told loads of people via digital marketing to not use you guys at all and the reasons why and not to buy off you at all. We have reported your business to the right people. I am taking a screen shot of what is written here and posting it everywhere. I want my money back  and I will be writing to you directly.no not complain and the laptop did not die it needed a reinstall and the key from a a IT  guy who has 30 years experience said the key was false and in use when he uploaded and logged in the key, it came back as in use already. You have messed with the wrong person,  I WANT MY MONEY BACK YOU SCAMMERHA WENT TO SCAM DETECTOR WEBSITE AND POSTED THERE, I SEE YOUR SITE IS ON THERE AND HAS A HIGH RANKING FOR BEING A SCAM SITE AND I HAVE JUST ADDED TO IT. YOU SENT A FALSE KEY AND MY IT GUY HAS ALREADY DONE A FULL REINSTALL ON MY LAPTOP THAT WAS NOT DEAD, LIKE YOU CLAIM FALSELY. TODAY MY IT DIGITAL MARKETING TEAM WILL BE HARD AT WORK DEALING WITH YOUR SCAM SITE."

I now feel comfortable in purchasing other software from them.Old Review Update Above:  I am one of the few looks like that had a problem installing the software.  Followed instructions provided by support, but not successful.  Not able to get a refund because of the download and the acquiring of the key which is not usable.  A waste of money for me.  Remote access by the company to help with install would be nice.  I now have a product that I can't use.  Bought because of loss of access to a prior license.  I learned an expensive hard lesson."

You dl office product from the microsoft website & the product key will come from B.R-S.I really didn't know what to expect and got the dreaded \"product key has already been used\" message when trying to activate. This is where my anxiety kicked in, as I did wait 24hrs for a response from support, but they do send you a couple of emails on what to do.  Ultimately, it requires a phone activation, which they were willing to do through email, but I activated it myself.Overall, definitely not your traditional software purchase and it's all good to go, but it is an authentic product key as my office'19 is activated. 4.5 stars"

I was not sure if everything was OK or if they just did me a favor (although this won't be the MS style).I plan to come back and buy again, but I need to understand how the \"recycling\" process works.Also, from the technical perspective, let's assume I have to replace teh HDD or reinstall the entire OS on the same machine, would I be able to reactivate the SW?

While their online You Tube videos are very helpful and easy to follow, my machine was so old that my computer kept giving me error messages, even when I burned a flash drive for direct installation. It took a few sessions with the technical support team to finally resolve all of my problems.  They easily spent 2 plus hours on the phone with me and ultimately Tom, an excellent and very competent support team member, took control of my computer and installed a digital copy of Windows 10.  The only hiccup is I had to purchase a $17 driver from Amazon   in order to replace my Linksys driver which was not compatible with 10.  So bottom line, for just over $50 I now have an but totally refurbished machine which is totally satisfactory for the business work I do with it.  And did I mention, the support team is terrific!"
