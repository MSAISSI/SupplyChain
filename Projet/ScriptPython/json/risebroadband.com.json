So far the experience hasn't been pleasant. We finally had a tech show up and do the install but it only worked for an hour and now we are having to wait for another service call so hopefully they will actually show and fix it. If they can get it resolved then I will be happy to change my review. I can say the tech support people are very friendly and courteous."

We sit down to watch TV, no internet, middle of the day we go to do some banking, no internet. At first tried leaving it a while to see if it came back on but it never did. When it didn't we called the company, they'd say there was nothing wrong and there were no outages and everything looked to be working OK their end and suddenly, as if by magic, while they're talking it comes back up. This has happened multiple times now.I don't want to have to spend an hour on the phone 3 times per week because they have diverted service somewhere else.Also, at the best if times, the service they are giving us is less than 75% of the speed we're paying for.We changed to Rise from Hughes because we despised Hughes honestly they were never as bad as this!"

We pay $100 a month and have been unable to completely utilize what we pay for. For the last two days, I\u2019ve attempted to speak with someone who can help me. The first phone call resulted in being hung up on before I could even speak to anyone, yet I was still able to do a review. Poor ratings from me obviously. Today, I called again and was greeted by an impatient and condescending customer service rep. He informed me that my signal was fine (he must think I enjoy making phone calls when apparently not needed). He then proceeds to tell me we need a new router. So, we go out and buy one. Now, we have sat here for over two hours trying to get the Rise modem to connect to our router without dropping every two minutes. I have now been on hold for over 30 minutes and their call center is about to close. The second we are able to switch internet providers, we will 100% be doing just that.

I called got a person that told me to change my password and run malware and let them know or she could forward me to cancellation department, what??? I have never had a late bill with this company ever! To act like my years of this company means nothing? You can pound sand Rise Broadband if you treat your customers like that I'm looking for a provider that I can get good help, not a simple change your password and run malware and let us know. No one has hacked into my connection, all the users connected are listed from my router. I'll be leaving this company after this many years. Customer Care sucks!"

For several months I had been getting 50-55mbps reliably, even during peak hours, but they sent out one of their \"We'll be doing network maintenance\" emails for 1/25/22, then shortly after that my download speeds dropped to what they are now. Strangely my upload was running at 20mbps for several days, which was nice. A couple days ago I called them to find out what was wrong, and the support person told me I was actually supposed to only be getting 5mbps for the $75+ I was paying at the time, and that if I wanted the 50mbps that I had already been getting for the past several months, I needed to pay $90. Spectrum is now installed less than half a mile away; if Rise expects to keep ANY of the 350 to 400 households in this area as customers they need to get their service fixed and start engendering some customer loyalty."

As an avid competitive gamer, it has effectively nullified my past month and a half  or more of online gaming. At the time of writing this review, it is 730pm on august 8th. i have had intermittent to no connectivity since mid June! Completely Unsatisfactory. Ive always had connection issues, dropped connection, slower than usable speeds, etc. but never so bad that i cant sign on at all. ive actually received a temporary ban for the overbearing latency on a rust server. citing \"Your ping is so high the server cant tell what youre doing.\" It literally thought i was hacking it was so bad. Would NOT recommend unless its the absolute very last option. I'm considering switching to satellite or some other alternative. I'm down to using my phones hotspot for YouTube as it wont even load a YouTube video further than 5 seconds before buffering for 10 seconds or more. Its Infuriating!! I've made multiple calls over the course of the past few weeks. Received the same explanations and the same response each time, \"You're network issues and connectivity problems are cause by congestion on a tower upstream. Our engineers are aware of the issue, but there is no time listed as to when it will be fixed.\" <-- Actual quote from more than 2 Actual 'internet troubleshooting' agents. What a joke. I wil be suspending my service very soon if this doesnt get fixed. I will be exploring my other options for internet and will likely choose the first one able to guarantee no intermittency. I was credited for $80 out of $96 of my bill although it was completely unusable. Im still going to have to pay $16 a month for a service I have absolutely no use of. I will be surprised if it even lets me submit this review at this point. -Unsatisfied Customer"

Because of their limited support hours, two of those events I could not report real time, or find out what was going on.WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE from my perspective.RISE has not built a fault tolerant resilient network.  Rise is quick to blame a fiber break on an upstream path, but fails to have a second provider to failover too on their backhaul.   A Level 1 tech has never once provided real assistance.  Level 1 will not get me too Level 2 support.Level 1 support lacks sufficient training, and access to resources.Sometimes Level 1 can confirm there is an outage.  I have informed them at times when there was an outage.  Sure they can ping you inside their IP domain, but that only test one thing.  They need to learn how to use tracert, and other tools.I have even had a Level 2 tech do damage to my configuration, which took me down for days and took Level 3 to sort out.What RISE should do:Allow customers to opt in for a cell phone alert system, so that  when there are outages  proactive text messages can be sent out, with an ETR (estimated time to repair).This would cut their overhead for call center support.Provide paid time for additional IP training for call center tech support.Architect, and build a fault tolerant resilient network.  Defined by a ring, or diverse entrance to facilities of separate carriers.Use HSRP or some iteration of for failover of routers, when doing maintenance, or having failures on switches or routers.  Stock duplicate infrastructure of critical parts with current configs, and code on site.Notify potentially affected customers of scheduled maintenance via text messages on and opt in basis.Hopefully this will reach someone at the C-Level who can budget for some of these resources.If I had another choice of carriers, I would chose it.  Please implement some of the suggestions I have forwarded.Thanks, Ken"

On Wednesday, 04/20/2022, a technician came out to ensure that my internet antenna pole was secured to the tripod. He said that he secured the pole and that everything was working.I did not check because I was in a hurry to go somewhere. When I returned home, I discovered that I had no Internet.I called and asked that he return to correct the issue, but the call-taker said that I would have to be placed on a waiting list for another appointment.Why couldn\u2019t he have just called the technician, ask him to turn around, and return to my house to correct the problem? We are in the age of technology. Anyone can be located at any time. Everyone is reachable.I work completely from home, and the internet is my livelihood. No internet means no income! I know that this is a very difficult concept for you to understand (really, a person with less than a GED should be able to grasp this concept)\u2014or perhaps you\u2019re so independent that customer service is a disruption of your cushy day.In any case, I am SICK OF RISE BROADBAND, and I will be sure the let others know how deficient, nonchalant, obtuse, and simply substandard you are!Please accept this as my account TERMINATION, and come take your router, dish, and pole. When you access the roof, I have a silicone pad to place between your ladder and the gutter to prevent damage to the gutter. Please do NOT place your ladder directly on the gutter.Not only have I personally inspected my new roof and gutters, I also have pictures of it in its new condition. If the technician who will be coming to remove the equipment causes ANY DAMAGE to my new roof, gutters, or any other property belonging to me, I will take appropriate action.And I am NOT paying the service charge for the call on 04/20/2022.I had to call eight times to terminate the account. Really?!?!When I was finally able to speak with someone in the Cancellation Department on 04/21/2022, she said that she could \u201chave someone come out right away\u201d. Why was that impossible the previous day?By the way, you might want to have someone proofread your automated emails."

          "Contenu": "I was happy with my call about getting service and my installation. I was told that my bill would be $85 dollars a month. I was ok with that. The man who did the installation said he brought 3 router's but I only needed one. He called and got it change. He said my bill would go down some. Which was $165.00 which i paid online. I called to make sure that they got my payment which they did. The person I talked to told me my bill was going to be $95 dollars a month and that's not what I was told. I did come upset. He said something about tech support for phones and computer was only $10 a month I didn't want that. I had to ask 3 times what he was talking about. That made my bill go down to $85 dollars. I only needed one router. So my question is who is right? I am upset that I got told 2 different things. So as for now I am just going to see how this goes. I am not happy right now with it. I also think that I should have the choice to be enrolled in Direct pay. And not get charged extra money. I will wait and see how this goes."

          "Contenu": "Where do I begin?  I've had this service for years.  It used to be decent service but has gradually got useless.  The last four weeks it has been completely dead 80-90 percent of the time.  I called 3 weeks ago and a repairman came.  He couldn't figure it out and said he needed to talk to his boss.  I waited a week and heard nothing from them.  I called back and they said they would contact the field supervisor and either he or herself would call me within a couple of hours.  I waited 8 days, still no call!  I called yesterday and the first representative said they must have updated or moved the equipment on the tower and I no longer have signal.  But they will offer me a discount price if I want to keep it.  I asked to speak with someone over him.  She told me there is too many trees between me and the tower (a mile away from me).  She said there was nothing they could do to give me service.  I asked to speak with someone abover her.  She said he would call me within 24 hrs.  It's been 26 hours and no call!  My service is slow, I get that because I'm in a rural area but to go from it working in January to absolutely nothing in February, is just wrong!  This isn't fair to me.  I've been a faithful customer and dealt with their horrible service for so many years, I deserve a better, reasonable answer.  Not to mention the disrespect of not even contacting me for almost 4 weeks!  Something has happened and I don't think they want to investigate it any further, they just want to get rid of me.  I WANT BETTER ANSWERS!!  Also, I was told my current bill would be credited to a zero balance and it's still showing it due by Feb. 12th.  WHY??????  I'm not paying for service I'm not receiving!!  EDIT:. After seeing Rise Broadband automated reply... I'M STILL WAITING IN YOUR PHONE CALL BACK!"

But last evening was the last straw.  I could not watch TV, response with arming and managing my alarm system was halting, I couldn't close my blinds, or manage some lights (all internet connected).  So called Tech support at 5:13 PM, talked to Irwin.  A nice enough guy.  Before calling I tried numerous times to run the RISE BB speedtest.  After many, many attempts finally got it to run.Download speed 4mb/s  ( I pay for 25mb/s)Upload speed 0.0mb/s (never seen that before)Latency 34 milliseconds. (just to their POP.  WOW!, should be half that.)Jitter 3049ms (HUH! that is over 3 seconds variation in packet latency). Don't know how that is possible.  One would expect a packet timeout first.To see if Irwin had been trained I asked, \"What is Jitter?\"Irwin started talking about signal strength, and I immediately knew that he knew little about networking.   Jitter is a difference in packet to packet latency variation.I continued, and explained my problems.  Again, he was nice, but just not trained properly.He said there was a ticket opened for congestion.I asked, \"When was it opened?\"The answer was not what I expected.  \"August 29th.\"Today is November 18th.I asked to speak to someone in Tier 2.  \"No one available.\"  I asked when someone would call me back.  Irwin replied, \"24 hours?'I told him, \"Unlikely, it was Friday evening, and Monday at the soonest, if at all\"  Nine time out of ten times, I never get a call back.I asked to speak to a Supervisor.  At about 5:44PM I was connected  (name sounded like Axel).  He was also pleasant in listening to my tales of woe.I learned that the ticket for congestion opened since Aug 29th was being resolved.  Not so fast with the Hurrah!  Maybe in February.  I didn't ask which year.  I assumed 2023.What causes congestion?Over subscription of services.What is that?Management in its greediness has sold more bandwidth than it can deliver.  Profit is more important than satisfied customers.I had some questions for Axel.  I also apologized numerous time about being an unhappy customer.  The poor service wasn't his fault.I wanted to know if the new fiber coming in February was going to be delivered with diverse entrance, for fault tolerance and redundancy.  This may be over the head of many, but just think redundancy and fault tolerance.He didn't know.  I would not expect him to know, but I want to know if in February (maybe) that the solution being installed will provide a more reliant infrastructure.  While I weigh the future of a SPACE-X implementation.  I asked for him to give me a call back with the information.I don't expect that he will, because his job is geared for handling the minute to minute issues, not the future.  Again, he was a good guy, but just couldn't do much.  He did offer me 50% off for the next 6 months, but given the choice, I would rather receive the the service I pay monthly for.UPDATE, 24 HOURS LATER:Rise BB speedtest site174ms to the test server.  Should be 1/10th this.Jitter 488ms.  This 1/2 second indicates a serious problem, and will cause all sorts of issues when trying to communicate in full duplex,  In other words a conversation.Upload 2.7mb/s download 3.6mb/s  I purchased a 25mb/s service and am getting a fraction of that.ADVICE TO MANAGEMENT:  Take down your speedtest site.  It does nothing favorable for you.===/===/===/===/===/===/UPDATED 11/19AFTER READING THE RESPONSE TODAY From RISE BB....As directed called the 844 number so they could,  \"Help me out\".The support number works, but no help.  Over subscription congestion still exists."

When it works, it's like water in the proverbial desert of poor rural internet, but when it doesn't work you are trapped without internet and they are ruthless with their customer service approach. Their local monopoly in rural areas is problematic because they can exploit people with already limited resources. For any powers-that-be reading this, the poor rural internet access problems in the U.S. make us into a third world country (pardon the non pc reference) and will be another layer in our societal demise. As a Rise Broadband customer, we experience consistent, weekly outages. But after a long term outage, no transparency, and inability to get appropriate customer service, I have given up on them. Now I'm here in hope that a class action lawsuit will be eventual, while I limply rant like a troll on the internet using my phone's hotspot. This is a fruitless complaint, but a PSA for future customers: If you're like me, don't give up on other options. I have used my cell provider as a hotspot in many rural areas and it works wonders, especially in a pinch like this. I'm now looking into permanent cellular hotspot with a cellular booster option, which I know exist for RVers (and is baked into many new cars). Try negotiating with your cell phone company to provide your town hotspot options. We should not have to be victim to rural monopoly from Rise Broadband. The future is coming RB, so you better step up with very consistent internet connection that is servicable for streaming and significantly improve your customer service, because this post is a harbinger of bad news. Hotspot prices are annually improving. I'm moving on."

The tower I am connected to is severely overloaded to the point where I barely get 5 mbps most days, and I usually have to wait until the middle of the night/early in the morning to do any sort of gaming because the ping is so bad, and also because packet loss can climb as high as 10 percent. (I pay for 50 mbps). Service drops and disconnects are common. Sadly, there isn't much that can be done, aside from upgrading the tower, which I feel certain will never happen. Customer support isn't very good. All the do is tell you to power cycle your router and the radio, which doesn't solve the root problem of the tower being overloaded with too many people. If you can avoid this company, do so."

I'd attach a photo of the speeds Ive gotten over the last few months but suffice to say, it's terrible. I moved to them from a 10mb plan w/ centurylink. Centurylink would average 3x faster with their 10mb plan than the 50mb plan with Rise (so far).  Century Link also wouldn't have gone down multiple times daily. I'm going to see this through to find out if they can provide service that matches their customer service. We'll see."

Most of the employees I've dealt with have been nice, but Rise as a company will frustrate you over and over.  Only competition would force them to clean up their act."

The bottom line is they are oversubscribing their towers and aren't updating their infrastructure to handle the load.  That is why everyone is having problems.  We are tired of the lip service.  Upgrade your network or accept that you offer substandard service and that customers will call you out until its dealt with.  Original post: I had two months of good service before starting to have problems with slow connection.  It has been 3 years and they have sent out technicians 5 times, each time they told me it was something different causing the problem.  Every time I call I have to explain everything all over again like they have never spoken to me before.  The buck does not stop anywhere at this company.  I think it is obvious that they cannot provide the speeds they advertise, and have not invested enough in their infrastructure to meet the demand.  If you have another option I would go with that.  It couldn't be any worse than rise broadband.  They're even actively trying to prevent you from seeing the bad reviews their customers are writing going so far as to disable reviews on review sites wherever they can, which is completely dishonest."

The ridiculous music on the hold line is still burned into my brain from literally HOURS I have spent waiting for a rep. That weekend, I woke up on Sunday to no internet. I had no service until Monday night (Cyber Monday). Therefore I had to wait all day Sunday to place my orders. Not convenient at all.A few weeks ago I noticed my internet speed was below the tier I signed up for by around 20%. After all the days of no service and wasted time on hold, my customer service rep said flippantly \"the speed is within our tolerances. There's nothing I can do.\"For sure, the day I am free of this contract, I'll be taking my business elsewhere. Service from this company may be more reliable in heavily populated areas but in my experience, it is awful in rural places. If you have another choice, I recommend you go with it. Also, the \"gift card\" I was promised under the contract took several phone calls and unanswered explanations before I finally received it. The only reason I'm giving Rise 2 stars is because they do in fact provide service. But that's as good as it gets."

I knew tech support was not available at that hour, so waited till the next morning.  Called in about 05:35 and after a very brief wait Leo answered.  Told him I was still experiencing packet loss at this time. He said he would run some tests to the tower.  I waited.  He said it all looked good to him.  (Sorry to now get technical for 99% of you).  I asked him how he knew he was taking the same path from his office in Loveland CO that I was.  He was unaware of this.  I explained that I had seen multiple paths through the BGP area, and how could he know that I was hitting the same hops he was.  I inquired about the tests he ran, and asked if he was sending 32 byte packets.  He confirmed.  I said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you run 1400 byte packets to simulate the streaming type traffic I run.\u201d  He answered, \u201cThat was not policy.\u201d  I asked if this was a written policy.  He answered, \u201cNo, but he had not been trained in that (running packets of the type customers run).\u201d  I asked for tier II.  Leo put me on hold briefly, and came back, and acknowledged that there was a packet loss issue.  He explained that this can happen during peak traffic periods.  I agreed with Leo that there was a problem, but disagreed that it was due to high volume of traffic.  All in all Leo did his job, and did it well I do not want to get him into trouble. WHAT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH are two things.  ONE, 5:AM is not a peak traffic time.  TWO, the system should have been built to handle all subscribed traffic, and not suffer because of this."

This shows lack of knowledge and planning to provide a fault tolerant, resilient network.   These devices should have redundant equipment and paths, that allow switching over in no more than 300 milliseconds. BE AWARE These microwave signals can be interrupted at any time by radar in the area.  FCC regs requires Rise to switch to an alternate frequency anytime a radar signal is detected. Just in case there is military or other radar detected.  Rise is supposed to automatically roll through 4 alternate freqs, to find a non conflicting freq.  If this works properly you will be out of service for 30 minutes.   It doesn't always work right.  And manual intervention is required; and you are down even longer. BE AWARE I feel sorry for the 1st level techs who have to support all the callers. They can't fix any system level issues, and don't get frequent, and deep enough information to give customers a warm and fuzzy feeling.   Typically they don't have ETR, estimated to repair imfo.

They won't tell you that when you sign up; in fact they deny it; but they do tell you that when your speed is so slow it harkens back to the days of poor dial up.   So, if you stream all of your content, Rise is not the choice for you.   If you just need it for every day ordinary internet access to a PC, laptop or phone, then it's probably fine.  But if you use any streaming service, *poof.  And, just try to cancel.  Wow!  They make it almost impossible.  Run arounds, extended holds, numerous customer service representatives, more promises of better speeds, and finally a literal audio loop of \"hello, customer, we can't hear you; hello, customer, we can't hear you\".   And you can't cancel via email or chat.   Only after we sent a certified letter and made two more phone calls were we able to cancel our service.   So, be warned.  They actually told me the service would remain open and active until we were able to cancel by talking to them.   NUTS! To explain my rating of 2 across the board:  Customer Service:  as long as you're an active customer, the customer service is decent with the exception of the guy that told me we were being throttled because we use too much data and he couldn't help me in any way.Speed:  For the rural area, it can be decent.  Sometimes, 50 mbps.  But that with minimal devices connected at once.  Plus, the tower was literally across the road from our home.   When we had multiple devices it was still okay.  But once you reach that data limit, it's atrocious.  Reliability:  Quite a few tower issues along with speed throttling made it pretty unreliable in a lot of cases.Value:  Compared to other \"line of sight\" internet capability with the same speed promise, it's about even across the board.   But compared to neighbors that are actually in range of available fiber, the Rise plans are much more expensive for less."

When I called Mediacom about internet the guy I spoke with said, \"Yeah, we looked at that area. It's not gonna happen. Ever.\" So Rise deserves 2 stars for getting me internet. Now, about that internet. I had a guy come out prior to install to come up with an installation plan. When installing, he ended up mounting the dish to the utility pole next to the house. He said they're not technically allowed to do that, but he would have to come back with a team to dig a trench to bury the cable to be able to put the dish close to the road. That was in July. It's now February & the dish is still mounted on the utility pole. During the first 3 or 4 months we had the service, the signal would drop CONSTANTLY. I work online and meet with clients on video call. The quality is not very good, and we experience significant lag at times, like 5 seconds. I would have to keep my mom's phone in the window (where it got a single bar of reception) to switch to her hotspot when the internet signal would drop. Her one bar of reception hotspot was actually better quality. If I could use that all the time, I would, but there's only a 10gb limit. The internet would go out so randomly, it got to the point where I would joke that the sun must be too bright. It has gotten some better in the last couple months, perhaps because there are no leaves on the trees. It's still not great though. My husband is a soccer fiend & has been trying to watch the Cup of Africa. He tries to watch on 720p, but the connection is usually too slow to handle that. It stops every few seconds to buffer, while he misses important plays. It's difficult to watch soccer with a resolution less than 720p because it gets too grainy to see the ball. We don't have any other devices using internet while he's watching either. Even web pages on my phone take their time to load. There are certain pages like Home Depot and even Amazon that seem to be a bit much for this connection. At one point, I was being passive aggressive & didn't pay my bill because they weren't giving me the service I was paying for. I figured if they don't want to install it correctly, I don't want to pay my bill and shouldn't have to. I also was trying to bring attention to my service. That didn't work for me because not only did I have to pay a reconnect fee, I also had to pay a late payment fee, adding $55 to my bill. I guess I won't do that again. I'll just leave reviews instead."

The $1.29 isn't my chief complaint, it's the fact that it was added afterward without an explanation which makes me nervous going forward."

Also I'm not very tech. savvy, so the manual was extremely to figure out and very misleading on the new router I had to get. Took me 2 hours and day to figure out how to get internet set up, and I had to make 2 separate phone calls. One to your Tech support and the other to my router's tech support when all I needed to do was go to this 1.6 number (website) and set up an account. The Router I got made no mention to do any of that. Providing that on the router's instructions would have made the process a whole lot easier, and would have taken me five minutes to do vs. 2 hours and a day. I know you can't do much about getting the 1.6 number (website) added to the Router's Instructions but it also would have helped to ask me ahead of time what kind of router I had (the make and model number or serial number or something and see if it would be compatible with your service, and then if the customer is not tech. savvy (more likely than not) and they do need to get a new router, then walk them through step by step how to set it up."

Because the parental controls are clunky, I have to \"backlist\" each kid or person I want off the internet in order to pause them... because the pause or bedtime parental controls have never worked and my kids can play still use the web, despite it saying it's working or \"timed out\" it's a rough app that needs to be simplified, it's been 5 months and it frustrating every day as a parent. I've experienced way easier apps then this one.Overall we are happy with the rural Up and Down load speeds, considering our rural limits. We have experienced lately more issues with the router being selective with others computers and tech, shutting internet off all day for one and not other...lately we have been resetting the router everyday last few days.

          "Contenu": "I had issues with my internet. For 2 weeks it would work then disconnect, slow speeds and got slower and slower until it was under 1 download. I called to get it fixed and they said it would be 2 more weeks. I was told by the CS rep to call for a credit once it was all fixed and working again. So I did today. Asked that they credit me for the month that my internet was not working as advertized. All the rep offered me was credit for 2 weeks. Basically the 2 weeks I had to wait for someone to come out. I am a disabled vet and my daughter is doing college online from home, but for the last month she has had to go else where to get her work done. That means she had to go out during the one time we were all being told to stay home, because the internet wasn't working. I'm not asking for anything that isn't fair. Just want the credit for the month I didn't get what I was paying for. It is a shame that I have to go through all of this over $69.34.  PLEASE DO WHAT IS RIGHT!  But they refuse to credit beyond the 2 weeks. Where has customer service gone to? Finally was able to get the credit. In the end, They did what was right, but nobody should have to jump through these kind of hoops to get fair customer service. I hope this doesn't happen with anyone else and they have hopefully made some changes. Besides this issue, the service has been top notch. Having dealt with AT&T and Hughes net, I would recommend this company over the other 2 any day. Thank you Rise."

Also, speak with the tech that comes out. They are normally more willing to be upfront with you and what you can expect from your point to point at your home. All around I now have great service and 95% of the time get 100/15 with the other 5% being about 50/15 with some downtime due to weather and other issues Rise has little control over."

          "Contenu": "The Best Is Worth The Wait?Me thinks so!  We have been living in Buchanan Dam since 2008 and during that time have had several wifi/internet carriers, the most recent and successful of all being HughesNet, BUT the signals were intermittent at best, typically really weak and ever so slow.  We'd been pining for fixed broadband and RISE ever since we'd heard about it from satisfied neighbors but our house was a geographical oddity with no direct sight-line, alas.  With the addition of a new tower from which our roof's receiver can now obtain a signal we are happy - ever so happy - to report that we've got REAL internet - speedy wifi, quick downloads and uploads and STREAMING service (which we were calling \"buffering service\" for the consistent and predictable pinwheels we'd get every 1.42 - 2.56 minutes of a moving - it took HOURS to watch a 1/2 hour show!!The install process was a BREEZE - there's just no other way to describe it, especially compared to the satellite service(s) we'd had in the past.   We got three extenders but probably didn't need them (the signal was already stronger - even at our waterfront dock - AND FASTER than our previous 5G service).  We're thrilled, love Love LOVE Rise Broadband and so glad we're able to finally be customers!"

          "Contenu": "The question was \u201chow was your experience,\u201d not \u201chow is...\u201d, and that\u2019s the question I intend to answer from the perspective of being an IT developer who also does extensive homestead work. The installation was fair, we had to provide a taller ladder despite previously indicating how high our roof\u2019s peak was at 27\u2019, but that\u2019s fine. Previously we had Cool Access years ago, (bought by Netport, bought by Rise), so we had an existing hole in our inside wall. Since having new siding put on, I drilled from the inside to the outside to help speed things along. The hole was in the most ideal location, right under a siding edge and thus utilized. What made me unhappy is the hole wasn\u2019t sealed. I had asked earlier about sealing and had heard \u201cwe always seal...\u201d but dad heard \u201cwe never seal...\u201d I ended up sealing it that night after configuring the network. The installer also said they usually don\u2019t use wall plates, but just have a cable sticking out through the wall. Fortunately the installer had and provided a wall plate as I believe one should rightfully expect for a paid installation.They did provide a router contrary to was was indicated, but for a paid installation one should expect that. Unfortunately, the only network configuration done was, \u201cyour Wi-Fi name is this and your Wi-Fi key is this.\u201d Our previously established and extensive wired network was totally ignored, and we\u2019re not willing to drop our current DSL service until we can verify the reliability of their service. I can understand and accept this protocol, but this was a paid installation and I suppose I misinterpreted what \u201chelp you get set-up\u201d meant when signing up. I\u2019m aware that we can\u2019t have both connections simultaneously without a multi-WAN router, but we just wanted to switch between them when needed and use our existing AT&T router for the wired network.Not being as savvy or refreshed on network configurations as I am with web development or general programming, I spent the rest of the evening determining how to get them to play nice with one another. It was a matter of disabling the DHCP of the router who\u2019s WAN you didn\u2019t want and enabling it on the router who\u2019s WAN you do want, and from Windows command prompt, \u201cipconfig /flushdns\u201d and \u201cipconfig /renew\u201d (in addition to disconnecting a reconnecting the physical LAN cable to the computer or even rebooting if needed). This was verified by a knowledgeable Rise Broadband support rep, so despite some initial trouble with my dad\u2019s PC, everything else worked out pretty smoothly afterward.Lastly, the service itself has fortunately been beyond expectation. However, considering they recently installed a tower somewhere visibly behind our neighborhood and the antenna is mounted atop our 27\u2019 roof, that was to be expected. We get exactly the rates we\u2019re paying for with the basic service, and even up to 17Mbps in nasty weather so far. This is where the fourth star came from in my review, as while the installation experience was fair at about 3 stars, I didn\u2019t want to undermine the 5 star service we\u2019ve been getting so far. A friend put it to the test playing Minecraft on an Xbox One while it was downloading who knows how many gigs of game updates. No game lag from other players with good connections and an average Google ping response of 76ms with 3% loss during that hour. Only one evening did I suddenly loose connection to certain websites, including Google, wixmp, and pishop.us, which was quite strange. Seems it was resolved in a couple hours though.Thus chronicles my experience so far and I hope someone finds this helpful!"
