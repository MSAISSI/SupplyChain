          "Contenu": "My second time writing a review ever. I\u2019m still having and awful experience after purchasing my computer over a year ago. Literally bought it to play COD and the computer was randomly re-starting all the time when playing it. Contacted them multiple times and they tried to fix it over the phone and nothing worked about 4 times. Sent the computer to then I they agreed that if the PC didn\u2019t get fixed i would either get my money back and a replacement. They sent it back to me UNTOUCHED and with the graphic card loose. The pc was in the same exact condition, reached back again and they said they won\u2019t give me either my money back or a replacement they will just replace the components. I sent it back AGAIN and its been 16 days since they received and still can\u2019t figure out what the issue is. This PC didn\u2019t work okay since they one but they refuse to replace it. Working on submitting formal complains through corporate. I think they are an extension of cybertron. Not recommended"

CLX attempted to fix the system remotely but was unable to thus it was sent back to CLX the end of April.  CLX sent me a replacement system to a wrong address, and I am still trying to get the issue resolved.  Be careful if you get a lemon like I did as you won't get good support or resolution for their mistakes.  I am stilling pending a call from a manager to hopefully get some resolution to their error."

The company was not apologetic, refused to compensate me $85 which was the third party fee and said I should have instead sent the entire pc back to them to fix when that would have taken weeks with shipping when it was their fault for sending me a faulty non-working pc. Now I have to play mail tag to get the part replaced after they messed up my mailing address because nobody cared enough to actually send me a return label that matched the address I sent them. Horrible service and uncaring staff."

Took it to a local shop to get checked out turns out during the build a builder bent a cpu pin. Which ended up causing voltage issues and overheating problems for the cpu. The local shop sent me all their data and pictures of their findings I called clx and asked them what could be done to resolve the issue. The response I got was out of warranty you can pay for shipping, parts, and labor and we will fix it. Thanks guys you created a problem and are unwilling to fix it. 0/10 will NEVER buy from them again."

And again, and again. On Sunday, March 5th I opened a complaint with Customer Service. This was now 2+ weeks from the time I ordered, and during the order process the expected shipping date was 2/28. The service rep apologized and said it would ship out on Tuesday. An entire week went by after this conversation before it was shipped. The lack of clear expectations in the beginning, multiple times being during \"part selection\" or whatever for what should have been in-stock items, and the overall lack of urgency on CLX's part as a whole, has left me very dissatisfied with the entire ordering and customer service process. There are lots of companies out there who put together other people's parts. I trusted you because the website gave me an indication that everything was in stock and I would have a ~10 day build time, not a MONTH."

They succeeded as parts integrators as you can train monkeys to do the same. that\u2019s it, If you\u2019re a person that is detail oriented or OCD of things you have RUN AWAY. Even The Bios was outdated which wasn\u2019t even surprising. Brad and Timothy provided good customer service which is the only thing that warranted at least 1 star. Other than that PLEASE spend your money elsewhere. All the hype is like all the crap out there today smoke and mirrors. Quality over quantity will always be better. Would not even recommend to an enemy let alone a decent human."

I finally fixed the issues myself via researching throughout the internet. Not more than 2 weeks later, it appeared the video card was sputtering and going bad. I sent a message to customer support and after 3 days of waiting they decided to respond. At that point I informed them I will have my local business IT/Hardware guy look at it due to their lack-luster response. My highly qualified/professional IT/Hardware guy looked it over and informed me I had one of the worst computer systems he had ever seen. I do NOT recommend to buy from them due to their horrendous quality. On top of all this, there are rumors that many of their positive reviews are what some call \"self generated\". I got fooled. Please learn from my experience."

          "Contenu": "Avoid CLX Gaming (Cybertron). You can build a better PC for less money and less trouble.\u00a0My experience with CLX Gaming has been one of the worst experiences with a computer company I have had. I decided to buy a custom high performance prebuilt system ($3800) because at the time I saw it as the easiest option. Shortly after receiving it, I noticed flickering graphics where it would flash frames of what had been previously displayed in games like Fortnite. The system would also randomly crash to a black screen with artifacts and restart itself. I spent months dealing with support via email with no improvement.\u00a0\u00a0After months of back and forth, I was offered a full refund in writing, which I promptly accepted and was then told that the refund could not be fulfilled due to warranty even though it was clear how long the ticket had been ongoing when the offer was made. I have now filed a dispute claim with the credit card company and I am considering pursuing legal action.\u00a0\u00a0Below is a summary of key points from my email thread with CLX.\u00a0\u00a0Item:\u00a0Prebuilt Computer - Assembled by CLX Gaming\u00a0Processor: 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-12900KF @ 3.19 GHz\u00a0GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 10GB\u00a0Memory: 64.0 GB RAM\u00a0OS: Windows 11\u00a0\u2981\tJan 29, 2022 - Order placed and paid for.\u00a0\u2981\tFebruary 22, 2022 - Received via UPS.\u00a0\u2981\tFebruary 24 - July 21, 2022 - Moved into new computer, noticed issues, began self-troubleshooting.\u00a0\u2981\tA significant amount of time was spent attempting to troubleshoot the issue on my own before reaching out for support. This included checking for system updates, testing multiple versions of hardware support software, investigating error logs, ruling out internet issues, etc.\u00a0\u2981\tJuly 22, 2022 - Contacted CLX support.\u00a0\u2981\tJuly 22 - 29, 2022 - Went back and forth with CLX and it was agreed that CLX would send a replacement GPU with a hold charge until the original was returned.\u00a0\u00a0\u2981\tAugust 8, 2022 - I received and installed the replacement GPU.\u00a0\u00a0\u2981\tAugust 10, 2022 - Contacted CLX about the previously reported issues not being resolved.\u00a0\u00a0\u2981\tAugust 10 - December 3, 2022 - Went through multiple CLX support representatives and various redundant methods of troubleshooting with no positive result. I also did a clean install of windows on a brand new SSD.\u00a0\u00a0\u2981\tDecember 6, 2022 - CLX representative (with my full case details in front of him)\u00a0stated in writing that, due to constant issues throughout my ownership of the system, they could offer either a full refund and waived restocking fee upon return of the system or a full system replacement.\u00a0\u2981\tDecember 7, 2022 - I responded that I would like to proceed with receiving a full refund upon return of the system.\u00a0\u2981\tDecember 10, 2022 - The CLX representative went back on his offer."

          "Contenu": "I ordered the CLX TGMSETRTH0B19BR at Best Buy for pickup on 10/31/2021. It arrived on time on 11/12/2021. Excited to try out my new gaming desktop I went home and started to unpack it. I even recorded videos of me opening it up because I wanted to create an unboxing video for the PC. I was met with complete disappointment as soon as I opened the box and removed the packaging at the top. It was the wrong PC. To start off, the one I ordered was BLACK. The one I received was in a small WHITE case. The one I ordered was supposed to have a Nvidia 3090 graphics card and the small white case in front of me would not be an appropriate case for that graphics card. Also to no surprise, it was not the 3090 graphics card inside the case. The one I ordered was supposed to have a AMD Ryzen 9 5900X, the one I received had an Intel processor inside. The PC I ordered is marketed as having two USB 3.0 and eight USB 3.2 ports. The PC I received had two clearly labeled USB 2.0 ports at the top of the case. I didn\u2019t bother checking the rest of the ports past that point. It was absolutely clear in less than a minute that I had received a PC that would be worth around a thousand dollar when I ordered a PC whose regular price is $5,629.99. I checked the packaging and the manufacturer sticker Model number and the UPC matched the PC I had actually ordered. I\u2019m not sure how a mistake like this occurs; they labeled it correctly but shipped a completely different PC in the box. I went back to my local Best Buy and they were nice enough to take it back and order me another one. However, now I have to wait until 12/03/2021 to receive it. That is an additional 3 weeks before I hopefully receive the correct PC. The PC I received was such a lower tier than the PC I had ordered that I could not entertain actually keeping it and using it. This was my first time ordering a PC from CLX and this was the most disappointing experience as a buyer that I have ever had. I really am hoping that they at least ship me the correct PC this time but for a mistake such as that to happen that will cost me an additional three weeks without a PC is unacceptable when paying for such an expensive piece of hardware."

          "Contenu": "I was excited when I bought my $2600 customized computer from CLX. When it arrived on 3/2, I added two 16 mb RAM sticks with the 2 RAM 16 mbs sticks that came with the computer because CLX ( I called CLX two times on 3/3 to confirm before doing it Chase, said I could do that ( 4 x 16 Kingston Fury Beast RAM in an ASUS motherboard x670E- plus designed to hold 128 mbs of RAM. I used the computer that night to set it up, turned it off and went to bed.  I tried to turn it on the next morning (3/4) the lights came on and it wouldn't start. After doing research, I swapped the RAM sticks around, then took 3 RAM sticks out; and it started after several attempts. I had to use one RAM 16 mbs 6000mhz stick and set it at 3600mhz. The Ryzen 9 7900 worked fine all the time, the ASUS motherboard was faulty. On 3/4, I contacted CLX tech support and spoke with Brandon who seemed helpful at first. We discussed options and I followed his recommendations of replacing the ASUS motherboard with an MSI motherboard and using 2 sticks of 32 x 2 6000mhz RAM instead of 4 x16 6000mhz RAM. (Brandon told me via email) 4 sticks of DDR5 RAM may be problematic with ASUS or/and Ryzen systems. He said MSI motherboard is better.However, Brandon wanted me to partially pay for the MSI motherboard (then waived it after I brought it up). On 3/7 Brandon offset after receiving my response on 3/5 by saying I have to pay for 32x2 RAM sticks and I can keep the 2 x16 sticks I paid for if the RMA team could not get the computer to work with 4 sticks of RAM (Brandon recommended earlier on 3/4/23 motherboard replacement and 32x2 sticks of RAM the day before and said nothing about me paying for the RAM sticks). Additionally, CLX was going to pay for shipping, but when I wanted a refund after Brandon kept changing options on 3/6, I received an email from Brandon saying I will be charged a 15% restocking fee and shipping ($525.00). At 7:11 pm on 3/6,  I spoke with Omar and I asked to speak with a manager. He put me on hold, he spoke with a manager (but wouldn't let me talk with the manager). Omar, said the manager waived my 15% restocking fee and my initial shipping fee is part of the refund, however, I have to pay to ship the item back.What could have CLX done better:1. Teach tech support and support people better consumer service; a happy customer tell others which brings more business. 2. When a customer requests to speak to a manager that should've happened. Never deflect! Managers are paid to solve problems, not avoid them. Omar did not want to help me, he wanted to get me off the phone and not let me speak with a manager.3. If it is in CLX customizable computer column and it doesn't work; STAND by your product and fix it...(Quality assurance is just as important as making a sale); even if CLX have to upgrade one item free of charge. Unpleasant Customer experiences reduce consumer confidence in the product purchased. Trying to get a customer to pay more money after having bad experiences with a product, is like pouring salt into the wound.4. Customers realize things happen, the true measure of a company should be to  demonstrate how to solve it, especially when the customer wanted to keep the computer.5. Listen to solve, not to defend. 6. Be honest and candid, it builds consumer confidence. 7. Customers like me want something that work, not try to get something for nothing. If it was my fault,  I would gladly pay. My computer built by CLX did not last one day; installing 2 sticks of 16 6000mhz RAM doesn't break a computer (or not supposed). I had a warranty that covered parts and labor and CLX still tried to make me pay some money to fix my computer after agreeing it maybe be capability issues that is causing my computer problems. CLX customizable sections when I built my computer stated no conflicts. All I wanted was my computer fixed and I didn't get that; so I reluctantly returned it for a full refund."

Here is a timeline of events that have occurred since ordering this computer:1. Computer was received on November 16, 2020. When booting up, I discovered that it would not go through the windows setup process and froze up. I tried reinstalling from numerous USB devices, it still would freeze. I replaced the M.2 ssd to see if that worked, same results. I tried installing linux on it just to see if it was a windows issue, same results.2. After troubleshooting, I sent it back on RMA3. It was supposedly repaired and sent back to me. Upon receipt, the video card was not working and was artifacting. I reached out again, this time I was told the video card was shot and their tech support lead offered to send out a replacement. December 14th,  I received the replacement and put the card in. I booted up the machine and found that not only was the problem I sent in the PC for not repaired, but Windows was instead installed on my storage SSD and the M2 problem was ignored.4. I reach out to their tech support lead frustrated on the 15th. 4 days later I get a reply that they are RMA'ing my computer again to fix the issue. December 21, the computer is picked up by UPS for repair, I am told it will be max 1 week. Instead of using next day UPS shipping, the computer takes forever and arrives at their facility on December 28th.5. After numerous emails, I get no replies with status updates. On January 4th, I finally get a reply back from their tech support lead telling me that they've basically done everything and can't figure out what the problem is. I reply back asking for a refund or a brand new machine to be built so I can get working.6. January 7th, still not received a reply. Every time I email, I have to wait 2-4 days for a reply. I send a note to their management and back to their tech support lead telling them im done and have filed with my credit card company. I tell them to refund me and not ship back the broken computer. 1 hour later and still with no replies to me, they ship it back anyways.This is how they treat their customers. They build garbage that isn't tested and doesn't work and then ignore you when you have a problem."

The process was quick enough but soon realized had I not made a call the delay in processing my GPU would've been longer. While customer service has been good, it is not the best. Had this not been the case, regardless of the RMA, this leaves a mark down 1 star.Update: This was a 4 star review but I am now required to give this a 1 star review. I am not a happy customer. The above circumstances can be made understandable and unforeseen. However, after multiple emails and directly contacting CLX Support, it is now 10/22/2022 and I have yet to receive my replacement GPU. When called, I was informed that my package was to be priority mail twice. After a follow up I was informed from a CLX representative that continued delay was due to their negligence in processing the shipment. They had their RMA part received on 10/8/2022, why is there a continued hold up at this point if it was sent on priority? I have paid this PC in full and should have expected better customer support than this. I will not be doing continued business with CLX in the future if this is what I have to go through. I hate this, as the guys at CLX seem like nice guys but this is just unacceptable. Glad others can be happy with the PC they got, but if you have to go through their support be prepared for a headache."

I spoke with IT who said he would email me the key code the following day Friday. Never got the email called customer service for about the 6th or 7th time they said they didn\u2019t have any notes of my previous conversation and no pass key was generated. No one will be available to after the weekend to get my pass key. So now A month later I have to wait and see if I finally get my pass key on Monday to finally activate my Windows. O and the reason I got this computer was for my sons birthday which because of the delays did not come on his birthday and when it did finally come it\u2019s sitting in his room now almost 2 weeks with out him being able to fully use it! I have to say it\u2019s been extremely disappointing experience that I would not recommend for anyone"

For some reason whomever assembled my system, removed the OEM RGB fans from the AIO cooler and replaced them with the additional fans that I bought and CLX Kept the OEM ones. Why would they remove Fans from an Item I bought? So I received my system with only 4 fans total when The case is RGB ready with lights and should be able to change modes and lighting colors but this does not work either. I was told they will be sending me out 2 fans to replace the OEM ones but not sure if they will be the original ones or not. I was told that I can have a computer store tech install the fans when they arrive but I would have to cover the costs? If I wanted to or knew how to build a PC on my own, I would have bought all the parts separate and saved myself about $600.00. So, I am a very unhappy customer what spent almost $2900.00 on a PC from CLX and now I have to work on it myself of pay someone to get it the way I want? 9-2-2022, CLX has offered to have the system sent back to them and have another one made. Once all is done, I will update this review."

          "Contenu": "I do not even know where to start with this review. If I could give no stars, I absolutely would. I\u2019ve had issue after issue since I bought my customized gaming pc. Spent over $3800 for the build that I\u2019ve at this time had to get parts replaced 3 times since last June 2021. I bought my pc May 27, 2021. I finally received it June 24, 2021. I paid an additional price to have my gaming pc shipped in a crate, which was charged for but not delivered with my pc, so I was upset from the beginning. I proceeded to unpack the pc to find multiple customizations that were replaced by with parts I did not ask for. Parts changed included 3 Red CPU fans (replaced by rainbow colored rbg fans), mousepad and a keyboard . When I called CLX Gaming customer service, I was told the items were replaced because the items I ordered were not in stock. After questioning the representative of why I was not notified of these changes, I could get no clear answer. Basically the items were replaced by whatever they had in stock at the time of build. That was the first issue.After downloading a few games, I noticed studdering during gameplay, I called technical support for help. The technical support agent was able to use Remote Desktop to run a couple tests on the pc. At that time, I found out there was an issue with the 2080TI graphics card. I was told, the graphics card was possibly damaged during shipping and was requested to remove graphics card and ship back to CLX at no charge to me. This is exactly why I paid for it to be shipped in a crate and it was not! I was even upgraded to a 3080 graphics card for the inconvenience which I was happy about, but had no idea of the domino effect that was about to happen. I removed the 2080TI graphics card and shipped it back to CLX.After several weeks, I received the new 3090 graphics card. However, now the issue was that the 3080 was bigger than the previous graphics card (even though the agent knew the build I had), so I had to remove the Sound BlasterX AE-5 Plus-Hi-res PCI-e Gaming Sound Card in order for the 3080 graphics card to fit inside the build. Shipped the sound card back for a refund. Fast forward about 3-4 months, there was a storm that had a power surge and my pc would power up and fans would run, but no signal was being sent to the monitor. I contacted technical support, the agent talked me through a few test and again, suggested that the power surge may have damaged the 3080 graphics card. Since the parts are under warranty, it was suggested to send the entire pc back to CLX for diagnostic testing and repair. After a week or so, received a email that the pc was repaired and tested and working fine.I received the pc back in a couple of weeks. Once received, unpacking and connecting the pc, I noticed that the graphics card was replaced by a totally different 3080 graphics card and not the one that was sent back with the build. Not only was it replaced, but it was a downgrade from what previously I had. When I addressed this with customer service, I was told the card I had was not in stock and would not be in stock for a couple months. So I had to make the choice of keeping the downgraded graphics card or wait about 2 months for the a replacement of the exact one that I previously had. I didn\u2019t want to wait so I just dealt with it. I felt like I had been through enough with the back and forth. Sending parts and the entire pc back in forth became super frustrating and time consuming. This has been a terrible experience for me all around. I spent over $3800 on this custom gaming pc with quality parts and it feels like I purchased a piece of junk! A complete waste. I\u2019ve had more disappointments than pleasurable moments with this pc. And now that my one year warranty is up, I\u2019m sure this will not be a walk in the park with CLX doing anything about it. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND this company to ANYONE!!! Customer service was a nightmare, no one calls to ask or tell you anything when they\u2019re building or repairing your pc. It\u2019s unacceptable. It\u2019s too much money being spent for CLX to make decisions on replacements and repairs based off what equipment they have in their warehouse. Not even the courtesy call to let their customers know exactly what is being done with their pc. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY! This company has to be using refurbished parts and claiming that they\u2019re brand new. Please DON\u2019T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! Too many issues within a year of buying this pc. After spending $3800+ on a pc, you should not have these type of issues!"

I will say that the support techs have been helpful and communicative throughout this process, which is the reason I've given two stars for the experience instead of one."

The customer service was great so I figured I would try again. The next one they sent me took 2 weeks to get and it worked great. When I wanted to upgrade to more RAM and a new fan again customer service was great, but that is where that great experience ended. They assured me that by paying for overnight shipping I would get it in 2 days it took a week and multiple calls to even get shipping info. Then they required a signature for the items so I had to miss work no problem, but when I opened the box I knew they never listened or looked at my last purchase the fan was artic white when I asked multiple times for a black fan. I called customer service and was asking them to assist me in putting together a 350.00 white fan and the person on the other end told me I really didn't need a new fan my old one would work fine to cool my new set up... THEN called back and they told me I would need it. What is really going on over there? It's a great computer and customer service was good but they really dropped a few pegs in my estimation. Will not do business with them or recommend them to anyone."

Cons- my monitor won't display. I've had to spend the last 2 days teaching myself about computer builds and hardware installation and troubleshooting because the VGA light on my motherboard is on and i have no display. Had to figure out what bios was, how to check to see if it needed updating, how to update without a monitor, reseat the graphics card, open my older computer to remove that card, test different configurations, trying to figure out why I have no display with my GPU. Can't test another PCIE slot with the AMD Radeon because the GPU support bracket was overtightened and the screw was stripped. Integrated graphics works fine, but since I paid extra for the AMD Radeon, I want that to work. And i wanted a computer that worked out of the box since I really don't have the time to learn how to build and troubleshoot a computer, but oh well. I'm sure once (if?) I get it working, it'll be great.Update 2/11/23- Got my computer back, visuals work great now. Except now my wifi card is missing. For $3k, I sort of expected to have a working machine over 6 weeks after I purchased it. I know things happen, people make mistakes, but still.Update 2/18/23- just realized the original box of accessories with all the extra screws, cables, brackets, and manuals was not returned with my computer. And my wifi card still hasn't shipped. No offers to reimburse me for the literal hours I spent troubleshooting or the hassle of contacting them over and over due to things their QC team should have caught. Never again."

          "Contenu": "Support was extremely helpful through the process, but man, everything else.I selected CLX because the price was fair compared to some competitors and because the production time estimate was low; I had a computer with a dying graphics card, and I needed a replacement fast.Production was initially delayed about ten days with no explanation given. I wasn't too worried at first. But then another 15 days passed beyond that estimate with no word at all, with my computer's status as \"testing.\"I emailed to see what was up. I received a response that support would check on the status, with no more updates beyond that - but to their credit, the status of the computer changed to \"shipping\" about two days later. I think the machine just got lost in the shuffle. I was excited for about 15 minutes, until I read on the shipping QA sheet that there was \"no graphics card on sale order,\" and no graphics card installed.Well. GPU availability is the only reason I tried this system integrator nonsense in the first place, so I was pretty sure that I had a 3080 on the sales order. Emailed right away, on a Thursday; support heroically got the GPU overnighted to me on the following Monday. It arrived the day after the PC. That problem was solved.By the time the GPU arrived, I'd discovered another problem. I had received the computer, unpacked it, and found that... the computer was missing all of the modular power supply's cables, except for the ones plugged into the motherboard and the fans. It was missing the cable for the GPU that never got installed, and other hard drive/PCI power cables besides. No motherboard documentation, no extra motherboard pieces like mounting screws or sata cables, just the singular power cable that goes to the wall.Emailed back again. Support said they'd send those out. Five days later, I haven't received that package or any tracking info, but I have already received some replacements that I ordered from Cablemod. The cable management was nice, except that I had to redo it myself due to the missing graphics card and missing cables. The system is put together competently, except for the bowed side panel from a misaligned clip. The case arrived in good condition, except for one of the side panel thumb screws bent out of place. I am really happy to have my computer, but I am not at all happy with CLX. Support corrected most mistakes quickly, but boy are some of these mistakes embarrassing. If I can help it, I will never purchase from a system integrator again, and I will certainly never purchase from CLX or Cybertron again."

Everything was going great; getting updates daily regarding the build, customer service was helpful with educating me, etc\u2026 before I go in to the full story I wanted to give an honorable mention to both Noah and Dimitri for their EXCELLENT customer service and hospitality; great employees. I first ordered my PC on 9/9/22. As mentioned everything was going smoothly and I ended up receiving my PC on the 22nd. I downloaded my games and started playing and the I received a notification that my AMD graphics card was outdated. I clicked update and it needed to restart my PC. After doing so, my monitors read \u201cInput not received\u201d. Keep in mind, I had been playing games for about 5 hours prior to this issue with no problems. I called technical support and we went through various troubleshooting but nothing ended up working and I sent the PC back for a replacement since they determined it was something to do with the motherboard/graphics card. At this point I was already upset because I had to send back the PC\u2026 Once they got the PC the glass was shattered in shipment so they ended up having to do a full rebuild. I spoke with the returns/replacement team countless times and they got supervisors involved to go ahead and expedite the process so I wouldn\u2019t have to wait another two weeks for the PC to return. I was originally quoted a quick turnaround time of 3 to 4 days. It ended up taking nearly 3 weeks. I just received my PC back yesterday and it did the exact same thing as the first time around\u2026 instead of calling them and potentially sending it back and waiting for God knows how long again, I went to Micro Center. At Micro Center they instantly knew what the problem was. The BIOS was 1.5 YEAR OLD. The graphics card my PC is running wasn\u2019t even out at that time!! Once they updated the BIOS I came home and plugged it in and have had 0 problems since. I\u2019m very disappointed that proper testing wasn\u2019t done not once but twice before being shipped out to me. I can only imagine, I\u2019m not the only one that has experienced this with CLX. All I received in return for this hassle was very surface level \u201csorry for the inconvenience l, sir\u201d. In my experience, CLX does not value their customers."

I ordered one of their pcs about a month ago which costs about $5K with all of the high end components installed. I received my system within 3 weeks which is reasonable as far as wait time goes. When I powered on the pc for the first time, I was very excited to start gaming and within 10 minutes I received a blue screen of death without any programs or heavy load running. At first I thought maybe the system just needs to warm up a bit after being in a crate for a week. I then experienced blue screens left and right including during web browsing. I contacted customer service and they said it was likely a memory issue with the RAM sticks and that I needed to download a memory test on a usb and diagnose the problem myself to be sure, which I thought that\u2019s what they were supposed to do before shipping it out to me but whatever. I ran the test and found out both RAM sticks were corrupted which shocked me because I haven\u2019t been in possession of the system for more than a week. Luckily they were able to swap out the sticks for new ones once I shipped the defective sticks back to them and they paid for shipping both ways which was nice. After waiting for nearly two weeks, the new RAM sticks finally arrived and I installed them. I was still getting blue screens even with the new sticks installed and I contacted customer service again and they claimed it might be a problem with the memory controller of either the CPU or the motherboard itself and that I had to box up the system and send it back to them for repair which I ended up doing. I\u2019ve had nothing but problems with this pc ever since I received it and now I have to wait even longer for me to use it, let alone enjoy it. I understand that some things are out of their control when they ship it, but it\u2019s almost like they\u2019re using second hand parts in mine. They should have caught all of this during testing, but it doesn\u2019t look like they tested it very muchOverall, buying from them is a gamble in my experience. I\u2019ll see what happens once I receive the system back, but I\u2019m not very impressed with everything so far"

I called customer service, rep verified the issue and said it would be corrected prior to shipment.  First thing I did after receiving the PC was to pull the back cover to verify the fix.  Of course it wasn't done!  I had to remove three of the zip ties to loosen the cables enough to correctly install the 3 connectors.  Issue 2 - Whoever installed the packing material inside mangled the Video card bracket.  Issue 3 - Loose motherboard mounting screw.  Issue 4 - memory speed incorrectly configured in the bios.  Issue 5 - Ordered a keyboard and mouse which didn't arrive with PC, called customer service, we can fix that.  Two weeks later still no keyboard and mouse.  I spent the extra few hundred dollars to buy a custom PC so I could have an \"Expert\" build it.  Guess I should have just ordered the parts and built it myself."

Not a big deal since I know how to do it, but one of the perks of ordering online and spending 1400 a pop is that I don\u2019t have to do the labor myself. If I had known 1400 bucks wasn\u2019t enough to have my PC properly assembled, I would\u2019ve done it myself from the start. As it stands, the PC is great and is currently functioning as expected.

For starters the free game keys had to be chased after to obtain instead of being included in an email or physically in the box when shipped.As well as the cable management in the back of the case being very worrying due to zip ties being tied way to tight to the cable, suffocating them to the point of indentation and making it impossible to switch out or even adjust cables and the power supply without damaging or destroying the cables.Finally one of the pcie cables that was never in use on this pc due to my choice of gpu came partially damaged/melted which is unacceptable in my opinion. I did not pay for damaged or used parts. Every cable, screw, and part should be brand new and quality checked as advertised.For a 2500$ prebuilt I'm satisfied but there are issues that baffled me considering CLX's fantastic reputation."

That was nearly a month ago and we still haven't seen them.  The PC I bought her for her Birthday had its manuals, and case components, but was missing USB wifi adapter.  I did not call CLX on this because I figured it would just end up with the items from the last call I made.  All in all, these might seem like minor issues but when you consider the timing of our purchases, both PCs had issues, and missing items were promised but never delivered well it all adds up to one main issue I don't consider minor and that's the lack of good quality control."

The cable management was pretty good, better than I could do myself so I cannot complain. Now, to start with the shipping, my order got delayed on 3 separate occasions and there \u201cup to the minute\u201d tracking is lackluster at best, if you want info on the order status just call them and they are usually quick to respond. Now the PC itself has 10 RGB fans that do turn on and run through there basic color scheme, but the kicker is, the remotes that they sent with it for the fans do not work, or at least the actual control panel that they are hooked up to does not read the remote. But they work fine and it still looks esthetically pleasing. The 2 16GB sticks of ram I received had multiple scratches on them that become very visible when the RGB is on. But once again they work fine and up to par. Lastly, I ordered a 3080ti for a PREMIUM price, that being said they do not give you the option or ability to see or change which brand you receive of the GPU. But I took the risk and rolled the dice, and wouldn\u2019t you know it, a FE. Which all and all are very clean looking, but does lack a bit in the cooling department. With all that being said the PC runs great. Got everything as promised, but didn\u2019t get the Premium Quality of everything from orderstatus, to actual hardware, but was paying a premium fee.

          "Contenu": "They sent me the wrong computer. Yep, I ordered a unit from them for about $1100, a lot of cash for me. I patiently waited as they assembled it and they included pictures and documents showing every step of the process from building to testing. It was all done with enthusiastic professionalism\u2026 and then they sent me the wrong computer. The one that was sent to me was a much lesser model than the one I ordered and I didn\u2019t discover it until I had set it up and was installing Windows. That\u2019s why I can\u2019t give CLX 5 stars. What I can say is that I feel that they worked pretty aggressively to correct that mistake. They were very apologetic, always professional in the face of a couple emails that were a bit angry and had the computer that I ordered shipped to me about a week later. If you should choose to do business with CLX, and I heartily recommend that you do, and there\u2019s a problem that you run into, ask for Brad Wilkerson. That dude should be working at the State Department, solving the world\u2019s crises. He knows how to solve a problem and does an amazing job at placating a customer that might not be too happy."

I managed to play on a game with a lower quality to run smooth because on higher it would be laggy a bit. On a different game it runs smooth than my laptop. I really like how its designed with colors with remote control. I liked all colors. Me and my cousin forgot to add Wi-Fi instead it only had ethernet slot but he gave me an Wi-Fi USB adapter, I am also using ethernet cable to run smooth and also Bluetooth isn't working somehow maybe I didn't selected when building my own. I used a headset and only thing I can do is listen to music with it but it can work on pc too since it works on ps4/ps5. I tried the headset on my laptop and it worked fine so maybe the samething, I probably didn't select it on building my own."

Certainly not the best value for the price, but to save yourself from headaches the prebuilt PCs seem to be great, just make sure you know what you\u2019re getting before buying. My personal experience, this thousand dollar prebuilt I got was exciting until I realized it was 512mb onboard graphics (good for really non-demanding games). For example: I\u2019ve learned I can\u2019t run games like Fortnite, Destiny, R6Siege on low settings. Fortnite was a shocker but hey, I knew all the parts that came with it, just not what all of them meant :/. Not CLX\u2019s fault. Personally feel like a pc starting over 1k SHOULD have better graphics- once again my own mistake.Customer service and their online support chat were both 50/50. One side where they answer and it\u2019s generally both real friendly and helpful, the other side being zero response (especially the online website chat, took too long to get responses there, waited up to 20 minutes before I gave up on it)."

There were a few hiccups & the return label I was given was not express shipping and that held up the shipping of the replacement order.

But all in all I would absolutely order from them again simply because the customer service and communication with the company was outstanding.

That said, communication prior to returning the laptop for repairs was great and I'm looking forward to eventually being able to use it.Update:  My laptop was returned to me after approximately 3 weeks of sitting untouched on a repair bench.  The rep I spoke with promptly addressed the issue and the laptop was repaired and shipped back to me, overnight, within 24 hours of contacting the CLX rep.   The issue I returned the laptop for (i.e., defective number pad) was repaired; however, while typing, I found that the \"y\" key was no longer working.  I contacted CLX about the issue and received a response within 48 hours, with an offer to repair or refund, but shortly after receiving CLX's reply, the \"y\" key began working, so I decided to not return the laptop, as everything else seemed to be working fine at that point.  Hopefully, those are the only two issues I will have with this laptop."

          "Contenu": "I would love to give CLX 5 stars, as there's almost nothing bad I could say about them. My only hangup is this: I had forgotten to add a wireless card to my order upon initially placing my order (that much is my own fault, I'm aware) and called to add one to my order. They were great about placing the order for me, and totally understanding, and assured me that it would arrive with my build.  The problem is, it did not. I did have to call to make it right, and I was without a usable computer until I could get it connected to the internet. To their credit, they did overnight the card to me, which was appreciated.Enough about the bad, let's talk about the good, because there's a lot. Their pc builder system is phenomenal, and after building the same pc on multiple different pc builder sites, I found that CLX had the best pricing of all of them. Ordering my pc was a breeze, and the ability to receive a step by step breakdown of the build process with photos and benchmarks was a nice touch. When I received my computer without the wireless card their staff was incredibly helpful in helping me at least get windows to boot without the internet (in case you were still living in 2008, everything needs the internet these days) which was a blessing. The computer looks and runs beautifully, and if I ever need to buy another computer, I know who I'm ordering it from!"

          "Contenu": "in 2023 I've purchased 2 computers with CLX, one in February for my wife and another in July for myself. They were each bought separately under different user IDs and names, so each time CLX treated me as a new customer. Reason to go with CLX was that overall 2023 GPU choices are awful, and they got 3090s back in stock which I ended up deciding was worth any possible trouble. They don't disclose the brand in the website when you place the order, though. Both of these computers came with ZOTAC 3090s despite the 5 month difference between purchases. Not a terrible GPU, neither a fantastic one. For the price charged, I expected a better model. Both computers are specked differently and for different workloads and uses, including a mix of professional and private leisure/gaming activities. The variety offered by CLX is pretty good for all major items, but it is certainly not exhaustive. You can find better items in all categories if you'd shop around and invest time, but it is hard to beat the convenience and possibilities they offer among all the major SI's and computer brands/boutiques. They do not offer CPU contact frames though, and they do not send a USB system recovery flash drive. Assemble time is far too long, and part of the waiting is due to their internal testing. That would be OK if all computers would leave their production line in perfect state, but that is not the case, so the waiting time in general is not good. My wife's order took a month to be fulfilled, and mine took 15 calendar days. They claim they keep you updated at every step of the way, but that is only true if your order is moving seamlessly among their production line steps. If anything happens at given step that adds delay to the process, you don't proactively hear about it. Once you do reach out to the customer support team, though, they are very responsive. The fact that I can add this statement about customer support responsiveness to my review however shows how many time I've had to contact customer support in the process of buying these 2 computers, and that overall is not that good. The packing of the computer for shipping is flawless. One of the computers we bought came in their wooden cage crate, and the other one in a regular shipping box. Both were excellently packed, with enough protection, foam and wrapping, and arrived undamaged. Neither of the computers was optimized for performance on arrival. Running typical benchmarks showed lower scores than expected, and mostly that was because of poor motherboard settings and adjustments. I'm not talking about overclocking stuff, it's more like adequately adjusted Fan curves and thermal profiles, turning REBAR on etc. XMP was turned on and memory was correctly configured in both computers, so that is a plus when confronted against the majority of the other SIs and computer manufacturers. My computer in particular arrived with all fans in max speed setting with a flat curve of 100% performance at any CPU temperature, producing unbearable noise even when idling. REBAR was off. Motherboard management software was not installed. I like the \"no bloat policy\" they have, but I do think that motherboard management software should be included and the computer fine tuned for performance given how many extra days they retain it \"in testing\"  before shipping it out. On top of it, the motherboard manual was not included among the physical items they shipped to me, which is another failure of their check SOP. They have one final check step before the computer is packed for shipping just to ensure all relevant items and accessories are included (they include that in a report which you can download from their website), and still missed the motherboard manual. Their testing process overall adds 3 business days to ensure everything is good, and I still got a computer poorly configured and with a missing manual, so what good is the delay in shipping because of testing if you still have to put a lot of work when the computer arrives before you can really start using it? Build quality is overall very good, including cable management. After 2 computer purchases, I can't say I have become a die-hard loyal fan. I've had computers from Dell, NZXT, Lenovo and ACER. CLX was the first high-end boutique I decided to purchase from, and overall I think they do a good job, but not an excellent one. I was hoping for an A- experience, but think a fair rate would be B-. There is room for improvement, and you will get a good computer in the end. If you know how to fine tune and adjust it afterwards, you should be in good shape. I will consider them as a viable option again in the future, but will also shop around for both price and inventory before committing to buying from them again."

          "Contenu": "While I am mostly happy with my order after getting it, the actual order process was not without snags and annoyances. I expected more when paying so much. My order sat in the \"parts picking\" phase for 11 days before I got fed up and inquired about the hold-up. No parts were back-ordered, so this should not have happened. I was given a canned, weak response and excuse about parts availability. I tried to be understanding, but felt some compensation was due as this was obviously an order that \"fell through the cracks\". I asked if they would give me a complimentary upgrade valued at a paltry $100 to make me happy again about my $5500 order. They refused, which was further infuriating.They also failed to let me pick my GPU brand, nor gave any notice on their website that the brand you get can vary and will be chosen by them. That is poor communication and feels scammy. Other sites clearly note this for their customers. I was not happy with the order process, the lack of communication with the customer, the lack of any desire to make my grievance right, and their exceptionally high prices which did not translate to a better experience in my case. The only thing I was happy with was the shipping. The shipping team did an excellent job in getting my system packed and sent safely and securely. I am also happy with the performance of the rig I received, but I credit that more to the parts I picked and the price I paid rather than anything CLX did.All in all, I could have gotten the same system for far less cost elsewhere and would probably have had a better experience, which is incredibly disappointing. I doubt I will be a returning customer for CLX and will likely take my business elsewhere in the future. This outcome is not at all what I was expecting and is deeply disappointing, again considering the price of my purchase. I expected a seamless process and did not get that at all. Compounding the problem was CLX customer service refusing to do even a tiny thing to make this right. Too bad, I really wanted to love this company.UPDATE: After posting this review, CLX contacted me to follow up on the problems with my order. Joshua did an excellent job of explaining things to me regarding my order. More importantly, he tried to make it right by offering me a few options. I was allowed to choose from an upgrade in parts or a small refund. These terms were acceptable to me, but more importantly, it was huge to receive a call from them. It shows they do care and that is invaluable. Fair is fair and I am happy to update my review as a result. 2 stars to 4 stars. This one phone call by Joshua salvaged a wrecked relationship and I will once again consider CLX for my future needs. All companies take note: This is a lesson in how quickly and easily good customer service can bring a customer back from the brink. And how quickly and easily bad customer service can wreck a business. Thanks for your help Joshua, and for caring. Much appreciated."

Quite pleased overall.First, my only issue was I ordered my custom unit 7/14 and received it 8/5, about a week longer than estimated and I paid for 3 Day Select shipping, which from pick up to drop off was 5 days (8/1-8/5) so the extra $30 I paid was a wasted.That being said, the build and the quality assurance procedures and their forms are top notch. The investment in the machine itself and its assembly are worth every penny! Great job overall CLX team, thank you. I love my new machine!"

The next day I did some searching on how to control them since I've never had a nice pc like this. I downloaded what was needed but it wasn't picking up the light strip. So I called tech support for some help, through more investigation I found there was a bad connection on 1 out of the 4 strips. The first strip was jammed between the casing and back fan and was dead from that spot onward. I was on call with Logan, who was very helpful during the whole call. He didn't try to give me the run around or anything, he gave me the option of giving me a full refund for the part or replacing it completely. Since I would have to take it out and return it for the refund I decided to do the replacement. I received it in a timely matter to no additional cost to me. If it wasn't for the faulty light strips and missing remote I would have given a full 5 out of 5 rating."

A tracking number was promptly sent. I received it on time and packaged very well.The computer was, as advertised and performed / met my expectations.  The problem arose after having the computer a week. The problem was extremely high temps and would not go down even though it was idle for over an hour.  I called customer support and was pleasantly surprised with a very knowledgeable, pleasant, English speaking, understandable young man who walked me through a fix.  A+ CLX on that one\u2026.. The problem was the fan placement on the motherboard.  That same young man walked me through moving the fan header to a different spot and the problem was solved.A second problem arrived.   I looked in bios to see if there was a problem with the header that went bad.  I noticed bios was not registering any of the 6 installed fans.  I called customer service and talked to a different young man.  Again this person was again top notch.  He concluded the fan control module was bad and sent me a new one.  I installed that part. LGB lighting works, fans work problem fixed.  Is the motherboard going to fail elsewhere? I wanted to send the whole unit back to be fixed or gone though. This is where CLX you get a D. Four weeks turn around to send a computer in to be fixed that is only a week old is a big fail on your end.  I would have even been happy with send this one in and when received you sent a new one back.  I was told that was not an option. In conclusion my review is I had a good experience buying and receiving the pc. Customer service was top notch and painless. Currently I am waiting for the motherboard to implode???? Will I buy again or recommend a CLX computer? Not sure there. I am not happy with CLX unwilling to go over this computer in a timely manner and assure me that the mother board will be ok in the long run.Sincerely James Cameron"

QA even detected that the RAM I selected wasn't expected to work ideally with the components I selected. I received a phone call explaining the situation (RAM would not have been running at its rated limits) and was able select alternate sticks (no change in cost to me in this instance).The machine arrived fully crated in pristine condition.

When I had issues with that PC, Aaron, at CLX, did everything he could to walk me through trying to fix it. When it was discovered that the damage was too great, he arranged to have it sent back and replaced with a new one. CLX, from beginning to end, was fantastic in its customer care. I will recommend anyone looking for a new PC to CLX. Only drawback is that they use FedEx."

All the techs I worked with where very good at what they do and friendly. When we  got to the conclusion I had a bad motherboard they made returning it and sending a new one as painless as possible. 10/10 would buy from CLX again."

Tracking the progress and shipping was super easy too. After a couple months of running the pc, I can safely say it's the best computer I've ever owned. Strongly recommend."

          "Contenu": "I enjoyed being able to see where CLX was in building my computer, seeing their checklists at each stage and the photos that were taken as proof. Shipping was great - there was a lot of care to ensure there would be no damage happened casually. The only issue was when I did my setup and Microsoft Teams kept throwing up pop-up errors. Customer service was very kind and professional. We did a remote login and he uninstalled Teams for me. That did fix the problem until I booted up the computer the next day. I got the error again (only one popup), but I did remember the CS agent saying that reinstalling Teams usually cleared it - I just don't use Teams. Four star because of the Microsoft Teams error, but 5 for everything else. I would definitely get another computer from them and I feel that I am getting full value of what I paid."
