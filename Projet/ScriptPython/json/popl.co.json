When I followed instructions it still did not work. Called today and she started acting like she couldn't hear me then hung up the phone. I called back no answer. So these are lies that they are saying good customer service because it's not. As I am leaving the review it has been 10 minutes and still no return phone call. But I guess when you spend 7.99 what can you expect? The phone number is based out of El Sobrante, CA which is only a 20-minute drive for me so it shouldn't be a situation in communication. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who has a good business. And is just trying to use digital cards to deviate from paper. if you could leave no stars I would. Its garbage"

May not seem like a big deal, but if you\u2019ve made a good impression and want to share your information the last thing you want to do is fumble around with your business card.They offer no refunds or returns per their website itself which I had no thought to look up before ordering because I\u2019ve never seen that from a company before. Horrible company, horrible advertising, horrible product."

Better Business Bureau will be notified to get all of the money back that I\u2019ve spent on two different purchases I\u2019ve already cancelled my pro+ subscription and will be notifying the Federal Trade Commission and California\u2019s Attorney General of Popl\u2019s Shady business Practices.

First the sales person made a meeting while she was boarding a plan. So on the zoom call she basically said just buy it and you can figure it out, but would not answer my questions. I was going to get it anyway but the red flags started going up. Then the CRO Jermey said he would give me 3 free metal cards to make up for it. Great I thought, so while dealing with Operations Assistant Barbie- I stated multiple times \u201cI don\u2019t want the popl logo on my stuff, only my logo.\u201d And I would pay a upgrade for it. But this was to confusing so they charged me for 3 new cards at full price, after I said I want to upgrade the free ones over 10 different email replies. Don\u2019t buy - great product terrible service not a professional company. I got 4 emails back apologizing but never offering to fix the issue."

I filled out all the information customs requested but Popl did not so they got returned. I then placed another order to a different country to stop the customs problem and instead of the 40 I now ordered they sent me 8!! customer service has been terrible. They said they would give me 20% discount for the inconvenience but never recieved it. Still waiting for a refund on the orders that never arrived. Its such a shame to have a good product and then the customer service totally lets the company down."

I emailed asking about a return/refund for the product and have heard nothing from them. I have tried emailing multiple times with no reply. You would think a business would at least have the common decency to reply even if the answer is no or they would at minimum try to work something out. I think their customer service is below par and would never recommend or use their product. I also have been unable to remove their pro product from my app/account and they have no information on their site regarding this. They don\u2019t respond to email so I guess they just try to get your money and than ghost you. I plan to contact BBB and as many other review sites as I can. You are better off creating a contact card in your contacts and texting it to anyone who needs your information.UPDATE: they replied to this review but can\u2019t reply to email. I have checked my junk/spam, everywhere. No reply. This is a scam and terrible customer service. Be sure that I will be spreading this info everywhere I can do no one else has to go thru this."

Supposedly sent a replacement but no tracking. At this point I don\u2019t want the Popl. It just shows what a mess this company is. Edited 8/16/2021-Popl has since refunded my account. However they don\u2019t quite have it together, now I\u2019ve got one representative saying they cannot cancel my order but would send a replacement. I\u2019ve received a refund via another representative and they\u2019ve sent a replacement already. I did attempt to get a return label/get the return address etc to return the item but they advised to keep it as their gift. Service definitely needs some work and customer service should be a bit easier to access but they did make an honest and hood will effort to fix things after I threw a fit and finally got some responses. Not ideal but a decent outcome. I purchased a Popl a couple of weeks ago. There has been no tracking updated, ZERO communication from Popl, but you can pay to speak to the scammers if you opt to throw away more money. It\u2019s a great scam. I\u2019ve attempted to email and text the given support numbers/email given. I\u2019ve contacted my bank to dispute the charges on items never sent. I also am unable to deative and delete my Popl account and the ambassador\u2019s account. I had opted to sell Popl as a side income. This company is not much more that trash. It\u2019s a great concept  but they do not deliver on product or customer relations."

For a company that sells a product based on image and self promotion. They need to up their game on how they send out their product to it's customers.I have yet to receive any update on the second Gold Card, so much for their email updates. The custom badge, I have not received any updates on that order. I did use the Chat option and connected with one of their C/S agents - Kath, who asked if she could follow up with an email. That was a week ago and still no word.Long story short, great concept but their customer service is lacking, and their follow through is even worse. Coupled with the fact that the Gold Card is hit or miss when using it.....Waiting to see if the custom badge works better. That's if I ever receive it!!"

We make NFC devices with 5yr battery life, so I know they can be smaller. Let's see how the cards look, havent received them yet. Definitely wish the custom cards actually showed a delivery date so I knew before placing the order if I'll get them in time.

Great concept but I'd pass on Popl.  Not to mention their marketing ads are cringe-level, psycho-stalker level."

Of the over 60 people we attempted to offer our information to only 2 we\u2019re able to use it with success. We tried everywhere in the wristband- the top, bottom, tapping with a phone cover, without a cover, even on the phone screen itself\u2026 hardly anything worked. Finally we gave up and went back to using our paper business cards- for which potential customers stuffed in their pockets and purses costing business and time. Great idea- not so great operationally."

I used it for the first time at a pop-up shop and it didn't work unless my customers took their phone case off. It's pointless because most people have cases on their phones. I noticed in all the videos none of the phones used in the demonstration had cases on them.. The time I spent trying to get it to work I could have handed them a business card and moved on to my next customer. I didn't even bother asking for a refund, just took it as a loss. I wouldn't recommend getting this unless you want to waste precious seconds trying to get someone's phone to read your popl. I think they need to work out the kinks and let customers know the limitations of their product. I threw mine away and just printed my information on my packaging. I still gain followers and have built a successful following without it."

          "Contenu": "I bought the metal card. The card is nice, and has held up well (though so far, it\u2019s only been a month). It was fairly easy to link to a digital card. I may choose to get additional equipment for the different cards at a later date. As a part time graphic designer/art teacher, I have to say - packaging was very well thought out, and nicely executed. One small thing working against Popl (probably all of these digital card companies) is that so far, few people  locally (SE Michigan) seem familiar with it. I\u2019m still fairly new to it myself (been to two networking events so far) - a series of videos on how to scan the card, best orientation of the phones, things to watch out for, etc would be helpful\u2026 many people (so far) seem leery about the tech. And if we try it, they end up just giving up after a few quick tries, and asking for the traditional cards.Again, this is not so much a problem with the company, but just that learning to use it is so new to everyone\u2026 There\u2019s a little bit of a learning curve.  Back to the good - I\u2019m currently using Popl Pro. The extra features work well. I do a few things that are vastly different from each other (art consulting, graphic design vs several of the performing arts), so being able to create multiple cards for each facet is a nice feature (for me). The digital \u201ccards\u201d themselves were easy to set up, and the design makes it fairly intuitive. The customization (colors, pictures, the QR code personalization) is nice, it\u2019s a good design. I like being able to link extra apps - like Square, Venmo, etc (in case someone would like to pay / tip digitally). And the extra links are a great idea - Not just social media links, but features like embedding video or linking with Calendly makes this a plus over traditional cards. That, and the easy editing features. I can rebrand or change my number in a few minutes, and I don\u2019t need to toss/recycle hundreds of cards or pay another few hundred dollars to reprint over a small change. Over all, so far, so good!"

I contacted Bry Campion, who was extremely helpful and quick to respond to my issue.  She indicated that if I was unable to get it to work after trying to find an Iphone to pop it with, I could get a replacement sent to me.  I waited a few days to see who I could find with an Iphone, but wasn't able to locate one. I reached out again to Bry about the replacement, she didn't seem as eager about sending out a replacement at this point, but did send one.  I did still have to pay for the shipping of the second Popl, (so it's not like this was a completely free situation for me). I received a new Popl, (flat white), and have had no issues with it.  I did place the new one on the phone case after removing the old one from the actual phone, (not sure if that made any difference in the ability to work."

I feel that they need a bit of tweaking for them to work properly.Now, the cards and the flat sticker versions on the other hand are amazing! They\u2019re super easy to use and connect all the time! All I need to do is tap them once, and they connect right away!All in all, these products and this company are headed in a VERY strong direction! They\u2019re super affordable, easy to use, and they don\u2019t waste paper. I highly recommend them for every business owner, independent artist, and for social media promoters all around!"

          "Contenu": "I think this is such a great concept, especially for small businesses. I personally purchased my Popls for in-person markets to alleviate waste from business cards. Unfortunately, people usually prefer to scan my PoplXL rather than tap. One of the frustrating things, right out of the package was my phone is not NFC compatible which prevented me from activating my phone-back Popl. If the card that it comes on had a QR code, I would have been able to activate the small Popl no problem. I was instructed to find a friends phone to activate it from, which is far from convenient. I will definitely continue to use and recommend this product to my fellow business owners, but I'm looking forward to some improvements. Pros: Super convenient once it's set up. Great concept and easy to add links to the account. Personalization is available to match your branding. Responsive customer service. Cons: not compatible on all phones, which really doesn't happen often but QR codes are helpful {but also free...} The offering of a second \"business or personal\" side to the app is awesome but charging the Pro fee is a little frustrating especially since neither side is truly \"free\". Additional features aren't worth the fee to me. Color and pattern choices are ok, but nothing really matched my style so I chose black. I'd probably get the personalized logo next time. Once again, I think this is a really cool idea. I definitely see room for improvement but I'm happy overall."

Thank you so much, Popl!"

          "Contenu": "Hi, i became familiar with Popl 1 year ago, and it was a magical idea about contacting people via digital bracelet or card in no time making it the easiest way to deal with people.That was one of the biggest advantages i have ever seen.On the other-side what i have experienced as a disadvantage, is stealing the information on the card or the bracelet is so easy, which i had faced that incident unfortunately with a friend who visited my place 6 months ago.In conclusion, i wish this enormous technology to keep evolving into perfection. Thank you in advance, & I wish all Popl team the best.Abed Ghalayini"
