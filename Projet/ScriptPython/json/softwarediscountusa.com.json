In addition, one cannot upgrade to Windows 10 unless you pay additional $ for a license to upgrade.  I find that this should have been made known to potential purchasers of your product, as this is not even remotely transparent in your marketing.

Who are you to think that you are to give your permission; assuming that someone would even want to give a review? What you wrote shows your bad attitude!  Your not special! Your not entitled! Your attitude shows through your words and it's very disrespectful towards your customers! Yes, we do notice! You were better off not saying anything since you obviously don't have the good manners, good breeding nor socially acceptable skills to address your customers respectfully and with humility!Please note: This email is sent automatically, so you may have received this review invitation before the arrival of your package or service.

          "Contenu": "I've received email offers for this company for a month or two. Then yesterday I received a review saying they are giving a special discount for veterans. I searched for this \"new\" price for the Basic Turbotax software and the veteran's price was $35.99. I then went back and looked at the previous email that I've received from this company and the same product was being offered for $35.99 in all the previous offers. I'm shocked and disgusted that this company is taking advantage of veterans in this manner. I want all veterans to know that they are crooks and lying. I complained directly to them and they responded with some song & dance that it was the distributors that set the prices and wasn't their fault. Buy your softward somewhere else!!! Later I received a communication from this company telling me the asked for a copy of my DD214. I never received such a request. I have 13 of those documents to cover all 35 years of my service. They all have my SS# on them. Therefore I won\u2019t send them to anyone. A request to see my retired ID card would be reasonable since it can\u2019t lead to ID theft. I also resent this company who in their response to me called me a liar. I think that alone displays their care for veterans."

This is unacceptable. Going forward, I will not buy any software from this company. As far as I know, the product key (license number) should only key in once and it should never ask again for the product key. This is so frustrating, I will buy from TurboTax directly in the future. What a wasted of time. PS. You may think you would saved $30. Please think again with all the time you wasted."

I did that and noticed \"not secure\" which made me uncomfortable. Shortly after, received privacy alert from my computer security system. I immediately stopped further download, informed tech support, uninstalled what I had installed, and requested full refund. I have sent 3 emails with no response. Will never use SoftwareDiscountUSA again. Spend a few $ more and buy from Office Depot or another retail store.

I could not use the second unit as software would only allow one unit to be downloaded on my computer (chat room person never mentioned this).  Never heard back from Software Discount on a refund after a number of request.  Just received my credit card billing and was charged for only one unit on this billing cycle, Hope that next billing cycle does not include a second billing.
