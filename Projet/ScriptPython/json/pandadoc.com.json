However, my experience quickly turned sour.Firstly, I was required to share my card details for the trial, which felt invasive and unnecessary. Upon deciding to cancel my subscription, I was surprised to find that they continued to charge me for months after cancellation, with no clear communication about the charges.This kind of deceptive billing is unacceptable and leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. I strongly advise potential customers to exercise caution when considering Pandadoc's services, as their subscription practices leave much to be desired."

Upon paying, PandaDoc moved my membership to $59/month! I have reached out multiple times over the last 19 days with no answers of how they are handling my company credit card and having the billing sorted! I have not only customer support on the email chain, but Nikita and Joshua who was the first person I ever spoke with. ABSOLUTE CRICKETS! Crap service. The only reason why I still have an account now is due to already building our template in the system and sending our contacts to customers virtually."

Right from the outset we had difficulties with access and log ins.  Somehow two accounts were opened and we were billed twice. For most of the period before we cancelled, we had almost no access due to log in problems.  Support was slow and only via email.  When asked to speak directly with someone to discuss the billing problem and access issues, I was told it was not possible. There was no remorse or intent to assist or explain.  The product itself was just ok; the template gallery was lacking. It is a shame that we wasted time on what could be a great product with good service."

          "Contenu": "Very disappointed with Panda. A legacy business customer who's been using (and promoting) Panda since the beginning. We required assistance by asking for our service essentially cloned for another area of our business. We were swiftly told that our 'legacy' pricing was unavailable moving forward and if we wanted the same features moving forward (that I've had for 8 years) Wed be expected to pay (in the rep's words.. a little more)  - which we understood.. However! our agreement costs under \u00a3200 a year & would now be expected to pay \u00a33000 a year for the same features we had prior...Whilst times and services change.. am& we are only a tiny valueless customer. to them (which was made crystal clear!).. We believe PandaDoc has turned its back on the very businesses and people who supported them and grew their successes .. especially when plenty of already established alternatives were out there to begin with..As for the platform. It's ok, nothing others don't offer nor is it any more customer-friendly... though we now know its pricing is not only monsterously high for new customers joining - but that they have no care for existing customers... i will be exploring significantly cheaper alternatives as they look very much the same. only take 5 seconds of google!! Cheers for supporting the people who made your business a success PandaDoc & on behalf of all your old customers.. we hope your success is long-lived..."

          "Contenu": "This is an honest review, please read this before signing up. I was asked by someone who refers clients for commission to set up an account with pandadoc. I signed up for the yearly membership and it was going pretty well until about a couple days ago. I added someone from my team and the software charged me double without even asking me at all. I took them off immediately and asked pandadoc customer service for a refund. I spoke with them initially over the phone and they said no problem. KEEP IN MIND THEY CHARGED ME DOUBLE. Now, instead of issuing me a refund they have sent me in circles To a million different departments and requested I do many things to get this refund. No one can give me the refund and they are continuing to waist my time. To be honest It\u2019s not worth my time to handle this and it\u2019s probably not worth other peoples time, and they think they can just get away with stealing your money and charging you 100\u2019s extra without asking. I figured rather than continuing to follow up with them I will write a review so others can stay away from this software. I will be searching for another company to use as well as there are many others out there.Thanks,Jared"

I would like a report of my documents and download it as CSV or XLS. This only available as a paid add-on and you have to be on a more expensive plan.

Their team will not go out of their way to help, they don't take any visible responsibility for coordinating a response, and they don't provide clarity in to when you can expect resolution. If you press them for support or solutions, they make excuses about the challenges around finding and fixing unidentified bugs, and you might even provoke an unprofessional response if you are persistent in getting answers.
