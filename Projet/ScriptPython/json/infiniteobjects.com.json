Sent it back in for them to re-render and when it was sent back, had the same exact error. Might be a picky critique but it ruins the allusion for me and this device is very expensive for what it is. Long story short, I tried with them they failed to deliver the product I expected and I will be sending back for refund.Customer service was very prompt and friendly, just not a great product."

After an hour, it turned off. Since then, you have to unplug it and then re plug it in with the charger to get it to turn on - no idea why? It\u2019s supposed to stay on with charge? And now it\u2019s entirely frozen. Just a still image in a frame. Such a waste of money. And a really terrible gift that is hugely disappointing\u2026"

Pretty dissapointed to pay more than 90 dollars only for shiping to Germany. Would not recommend if you order from overseas."

If they fix the connectivity issues I would recommend them but as it stands I just wish it worked right."

They had not encountered this (blue screen) problem before and have requested that I return the original flawed one that I received. I commend IO for its quick response and customer service. Questions still remain open as to their Quality Assurance process during production and prior to shipping. Original Post: I received my order (which was a gift for my wife\u2019s birthday) and upon opening the box, all that appeared was a blue screen - no video. We plugged it in thinking that perhaps it needs to be charged (despite the advertisement stating that all we need to do is open the box to play the video) and nothing happened. All we have is a blue screen. This is all very disappointing, particularly given that I have another order due to ship in Dec as a Christmas present for my mother!

During the process, my art piece was flagged because they had thought I was trying to print an artwork that I did not own. After talking with them and discussing back and forth with not only them, but also the artist online, I was able to get the NFT I owned printed. What really impressed me about IO was their dedication to respecting the artist's work and their willingness to cancel my print in case I did not own the art I claimed to own. IO really takes the time to respect the original artist instead of being just a money-grabbing company: a very rare display or morals in today's capitalist society."
