I just used cases.com cause Amazon cases for my phone was limited. And when you call after business hours it says calling after business hours.

Cases.com was the only place I could fine the case I was looking for. I ended up pay almost $60 for the case! When the order was first placed I requested and paid for overnight delivery (another $23). Like Ibsaid I was desperate.Three days later the case was still not shipped. I emailed customer service and no accommodations were offered. I was able to get the $23 back that I paid for overnight. Here I am almost 2 weeks later still no phone case for for my S20!!! For the money I paid this is unacceptable.Cases.com will never get another dime from me."

I had ordered a new phone from Verizon, a skinomi screen protector, and the phone case from here at basically the same time.I paid attention to shipping estimates so that everything would come in at the same time. Reason being I didn't want my brand new phone getting dirty or damaged before I had a chance to protect it.The screen cover from Skinomi came in from CA 2 days early! Before I had received the phone actually.The phone came in on time. Not sure where from but it doesn't matter.The case I ordered didn't get to me for another 3 days... Maybe it's the post offices fault, idk. What I do know is that my case wasn't shipped for 3 days after purchase. I also know it took 2 days to go from Aurora, CO through Denver before getting out of state. I seen that it took 4 days to get from CO to NY.Well I lived in Aurora, CO back in 2002. My now 20 year old son was literally birthed in Aurora Medical Center. I also know it took me 27 hours to drive from where I lived off Colfax to get to my mom's house in Buffalo NY. That's total trip time, including sleeping, eating, fuel and all.My question is how was everything here but the case? How did a screen protector from hundreds of miles further get here first? It was sent through regular mail too. Again, most of my complaint is with the us mail, admittedly.I however will never order anything from cases.com again. I can and have gotten items I purchased from China faster than I received my phone case from them."

Also, their so-called warranty doesn't cover anything but if they send you a manufacture-faulty item. Last I checked, its just good customer service to replace something new but damaged at no fault of the customer. So Cases.com did great and I love the products from MyBat. My ZIZO case is good, but I will avoid them due to their bad customer service and fake warranties. I would love to see Cases.com warn you of this kind of stuff before you buy it."

Those two events were not in anyway related, but I thought they were. Never assume, right?This edited review is about my new very strong protective Otterbox case that came several days ago. It arrived sooner than the above mentioned case because Cases.com sent it right out, packed carefully and ready for the journey.  I had this case in hand a couple of days after it was ordered. And, I love it! \u2764\ufe0fMy new Otterbox Defender Pro is my second Otterbox case for this new iPhone. My first case for this 15 upgrade was a Forest Green Defender.  It can get dirty, even slightly damp,and I know my phone is 100% safe. Years of phone drops into any and everything around has proven to me that an Otterbox case allows me to go anywhere but never worry about my phone.This review is about my most recently purchased Otterbox Pro Xt Defender.This amazing case protects my 15 as well as the case mentioned  above; it is an Otterbox, of course. They are both Defenders. However, this year I found that Otterbox added   to the always rugged Defender line up. My new MagSafe case is Pink, Clear, and has pretty flowers decorating it!This Defender won\u2019t get as dirty as my forest green one but it\u2019ll be dropped just as often, probably on harder surfaces. An excellent case. Very happy with this purchase."

I needed to a purchase a new case and wanted the same model I had. I liked this case so I wanted to buy the same one that was as my last. The price on this site is cheaper then the one I bought the Verizon store in 2022. The item came in a timely fashion and overall I was happy with this item. I would do business with Cases.com in the future."
