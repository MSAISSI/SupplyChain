Three of the screens are an inch larger and will not even come close to fitting. 2 screens were 1/4inch to big and we got them in but because so tight the screen itself is slack. I should have just messured the screens I have to be sure but did it flexscreens way which says \"Do not measure your current screens. Thus I spent a large amount of money for screens that do not fit."

I will never recommend this product to friends and family, especially for how expensive they are.To be fair they screens do seem to \"work\" though. But that's the highest praise I can give. My rigid frame screens from two years ago are actually better though because they seal around the window tighter. These FlexScreens have MASSIVE gaps around the window frame, letting bigger bugs like stink bugs just crawl around."

On the page where it tells the customer to subtract 1/16 of an inch or 3/16ths, depending on pocket and then on the order page it subtracts 1/16 from the actual measurement, which I did,  Therefore, the screen frames are oversize and buckled which makes the screen itself look like a burlap bag and wavy.  I guess, I should have reduced the measured size by another 1/8 and it probably would be a lot better.  I will not recommend Flex screens to anyone.Mike Olson"

That's too bad as we sell about 10,000 windows a year with a percentage of them being operatable requiring a screen solution. Maybe our volume was too low for them to lift a phone to call back or click a button to reply by email."

When contacted, the company said they have no control over shipping costs.  The product is called FLEX screen for goodness sake.  All they have to do is loosely roll or fold the screen and it would fit into standard packaging.  By not really offering oversize shipping, they do not really offer non standard sizes."

What a waste of my money and time. The screen itself doesn\u2019t appear to blow me away on build quality however the one star is because NONE of my four screens fit even remotely well in the channels. And then they send these \u201cretention bumpers\u201d to make a tighter fit, now I have to use these on every screen that I paid ALOT of money for doesn\u2019t feel like a solid or even snug fit my screens move around now and seems ultimately like it will not form a good enough seal to keep bugs out. My advice is to not listen to them on how to measure and then substract. Just measure your space. For the record I have your average big brand name vinyl windows nothing special or limiting and followed their directions and it\u2019s a horrible fit."

That is always up for debate and from my experience it will go the other way.  Will the company still be in business if the screen material disintegrates in 20 years?  There is no telling.  If it does, is that a defect, wear/tear, or environmental damage that is not covered under defect?  In addition, it says the screens have to be shipped back.  Shipping can be expensive for large objects.  Sorry, this product does not make sense at this price point and I'm not enticed by the limited warranty wording.  I don't feel a bug screen is an investment.  Good luck.  Seems to be a unique product with a price structure that may not be realistic."

I've contacted customer service 3 times, and now that I've sent them the requested photos of the dimension stickers (not sure why--the sticker dimensions are correct, the screens are not), they're ghosting me. I've called direct phone lines and left messages, I've replied to the same email thread that we've been communicating on, and they just don't seem to wish to deal with the issue. Like children."

Customer Service was VERY nice and wanted to replace the screens however I would have to pay for the shipping, $108, That's about 3/4 of the original amount just to replace the ones that are too tall. I declined since I didn't want to waste any more money on something that I couldn't use in the first place. I did use their video and measuring guide but they still were too tall. I'm sorry I have to give them one star but they ask me for my review..."

It was the solution I was looking for - practical, efficient, and clean and I ordered it right the way!I was really surprised with how fast it was delivered - since it is a personalized product I thought it would take weeks.When my screens arrived my family and I were leaving for Indiana, so we decided to open the boxes and check the screens once we were back home. We opened the boxes and I was disappointed to find they were not labeled, even though on the website, we were asked which room each screen would go. Then, upon opening each of the seven screens I ordered I noticed all but two of\u00a0them were crooked and one was ripped. Their borders were also damaged, so it definitely compromised our ability install them.So,  5 out of 7 in total were damaged. I need these screens to be replaced, because they really can't be used the way they are.Thank you very much for your time and I hope to hear from you soon.Rosangela Monaco"

When we were told by a representative that we would have to get half screens he informed us there would be a gap where bugs would be able to get in. Another lady was also of no help. Between talking to two people, with MUCH confusion with both of them,  neither of them ever once asked what type of window we have. At a third phone call for help, trying to decide if we should settle on a screen with a gap, and complaining that the website should ask you what type of window you have, the lady told us there is no way they could do that because there are so many types. REALLY? REALLY?! You sell window screens!!! Eventually I did research, found out the retail side sells a special type that has the edge that would prevent bugs from coming in. The lady FINALLY informed me that she could transfer this to their retail side to fulfill the order so that we would have no gaps in our half window screens. In the end, all that was sent was our screens with an additional slide on that would prevent the bugs. This was fine. But WHY DO YOU NOT OFFER THIS TO CUSTOMERS FROM THE BEGINNING?!?! THIS WAS ONE OF THE CRAZIEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCES IVE EVER HAD AND THE SOLUTION WAS SO SO SIMPLE. WHY ISN'T THIS SLIDE ON GAP PROTECTER JUST OFFERED ON THE REGULAR SITE???!!!"

          "Contenu": "Very disappointed! These look like great screens, and I was excited to finally get a screen for my odd-size kitchen window that is almost twice as wide as it is tall. But when I received the screen, it could not be installed despite being nearly the right dimensions (1/16 over even though I subtracted it) because there is ZERO amount of flex on the sides. All the videos I've seen of this product show it should flex easily at the sides. The screen flexes plenty vertically \u2013 top and bottom \u2013 but without any side flex it just won't go in my window. And I know they got the orientation right because the label is in the lower right corner where it should be. If they can't make wider-than-tall windows to flex at the sides, then they should put that warning on the order page and I would have ordered it shorter at the sides and used their little rubber make-it-fit thingies (which they didn't send, by the way, though they are supposed to be included in the order). I had ordered it through Home Depot so I went through their customer service and was told that this company had reviewed the photos I sent and decided that it was \"built within tolerance so there will be no refund.\" Talk about leaving the customer holding the bag! That would have been $70 wasted if Home Depot had not given me a full refund \u2013 kudos to them. So now I have a screen I can't install, a kitchen window with still no screen, and three more (standard-size) windows that need screens, but I will have to find another solution for them because it would be unwise to deal further with a company that can't be relied on to do the right thing."

          "Contenu": "Bought screens for my whole home under the premise they work on any windows (as advertised).  I paid for the highest level of protection (solar screens) and they arrived scuffed.  They did not work on my windows and fall out constantly (especially after rainfall).  I also cannot see out of my windows after rain due to the high density of the solar screens- you might as well cover my windows with black construction paper.  These screens are completely pointless and expensive.  We contacted customer service who responded we should purchase a different level of protection than solar screens (yes, please let me sink more money into screens that fall out of my window).  They then stopped responding to our follow up emails.  Their customer service is a joke, especially after spending as much money as we did.  I understand there is a no money back guarantee, but if you're going to advertise your screens work on any window that should be true.  Flexscreen should be ashamed of themselves, they don't stand behind their product and therefore offer no guarantees/returns.  Purchase at your own risk, or better yet, stay far away from this scam of a company.Response to flexscreen's response- it is not a measuring issue, as we've told you in several emails. We got your measuring tool before ordering and my husband works in mathematics. We also got a second opinion from a contractor who agreed it's not a measuring issue. The contractor said your screens would never work on our windows due to the way our home is constructed.  I'm not interested in spending more money on your faulty screens and unless you're willing to offer a refund, I'm not interested in waiting weeks for a response from your customer service team. Your last solution was to purchase a different level of screens, which we will never do. I've already wasted enough money."

Isn't there some way to pick it up at Home Depot or somewhere locally and skip the shipping? It's not like it lasted years. I'm in my 70s and on limited income.

Sandy at customer service was great each time. Each time I sent pictures of me measuring the screen, the measurement and the sticker on the screen labeling what the measurement should have been. Short every time. This last time they had to redo it, I was assured that the plant manager would personally check the screen. That was the shortest one of all. Not even close. I really wanted this to work but I can't go through this again. Thanks again to Sandy for all your help. You were the best part of this experience."

We measured our windows per the instructions, however our windows have a little clip on the top to hold the upper panel in..  this prevented the screens from fitting properly.  One screen came damaged.  They were happy to replace the one screen, bit since they wouldn't fit, why bother.  I asked if they would make the replacement screen to accommodate the clip, and they wouldn't do it.They did offer to remake all of the for $10 each and $35 shipping.  So that basically tells you what the screens cost them.  Pure crap!  I wouldn't do business with this company if I had the chance to do it over again.  And how do their employees sleep at night knowing they are helping to screw people out of their hard earned money?"

The bumpers they send with the screens can help secure them in place if there is any give. There is no adjusting these things and no returning if they don't work so I'm out quite a bit of money. When they do fit, it is just as easy as they claim it to be. Had I known this in the first place I totally would have measured different and I would have given them 5 stars."

Three of them I was able to force into place with a lot of bending, but two are way too tall to fit and will now be expensive trash.

          "Contenu": "I think this is a FANTASTIC idea, and I was so excited to install a FlexScreen in a second-story window where I regularly remove an awkward traditional screen to access a window flower box. The product arrived when promised, looks and bends just like the video, and seems to be of high quality. Unfortunately, the large size (height) of my double-hung window and the fact that it only has a single upper track to hold the screen make fitting the FlexScreen securely even more difficult than the traditional screen. There\u2019s just nothing to hold onto, and the FlexScreen has nearly dropped two stories more times than my heart can take. So the FlexScreen is going to live in a box under the house, and I\u2019ll go back to using the awkward traditional screen in my window. I would recommend if you have large windows, especially ones with only single tracks to hold your screens, that you start by ordering one FlexScreen to be sure they work for you since your purchase is not refundable/returnable!"

Second I got 10 screens and they came in 2 boxes but were not marked the size. and most of the windows were very close in size, It would have helped to have them marked which window they go in."

Despite using the measuring tool, the frame came in slightly too narrow. Thankfully it still fit because the height was perfect, but the screen material itself is also a bit loose, which means if you press on it at all, the sides of the screen pop out of the window frame. I suppose this is still easier than trying to create a screen yourself, but I am a bit disappointed for the amount of money I paid for this."

          "Contenu": "The Flexscreen product seems well made and Im happy with it so far.  The only reason I am giving 3 stars is due to the outrageous shipping fee that I was charged. The Flexscreen website advertises free shipping.  I ordered 7 screens and at the time of ordering there is a small disclaimer that some orders may have an oversize shipping fee. But there is no indication of how much that fee might be or what dimensions incur oversize fees.  So I paid for my order in full and then submitted my measurements right after.  Again there was nothing that indicated that my specific order had oversize fees.   2 weeks later\u2026 I get an email saying that owe another $150 for shipping because my screens were deemed oversize!!  I contacted support to reduce this fee and they said I had to pay it or cancel my order which I had already waited 2 weeks for.   This was a really poor customer experience. Why not tell customers up front about these shipping fees at the time of placing the order?  So for anyone considering buying Flexscreens beware that if your screens are anything but small you might be charged with $150 shipping fee 2 weeks later."

I purchased 4 x Standard Window Screens for two bedrooms and 7 x FlexView Tuff Window Screens for rooms that my rambunctious pets frequent. They know what a screen is but, when they see an occasional squirrel, lizard or other critter through the window they just have to go check it out. Sometimes that's straight through an open window. My expectation is the Tuff screen and frame will withstand their excitement. I like the idea of the durable screens, and the frames fit perfectly based on the measurements I supplied (I was a bit nervous about providing the correct measurements). I thought the ordering process was unusual. I had to pay in advance for the type and number of screens I wanted to purchase before the website advanced to providing measurements for each screen I just purchased. I also thought the price per screen was a bit over premium but, was willing to pay the price with the assumption the screens would hold up over time. I give the screens 5 stars \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f and the price 4 stars \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f."

If there was going to be a delay (I was given an estimate of 1.5 - 2 weeks after submitting measurements), it would have been so helpful if FlexScreen notified me of the delay.  In the end, I had to reach out to FlexScreen around week 4 to find out what happened to my screen.  At that point, it hadn't even left their facility."

          "Contenu": "Much of my reason for the four stars instead of 5 is because the company would not ship to my home in Puerto Rico.  I had to have them shipped to my daughter in Florida, and then I paid for the shipping from there.  SO MANY vendors ship here, I just can't understand why some still do not. The screens themselves seem to be good.  They are flexible, which is the primary reason I needed them.  I did not test how durable they are, fearing that they would not be durable enough, so in that, I can not advise.  The screen material seems to be fused to the frame.  There are spots where the screen material is hanging off after being fused, and I hope that does not provide a snag that will cause the screen material to be pulled from the frame.  I was very careful not to pull those tabs.I purchased 5 of the FlexView Solar, and two of the Flexview Clean. I had asked the question \"Does the hydrophobic water repelling coating keep rain from coming through the screen?\".  The answer was that if any of the screens could do that, this would be the correct choice.  After installing the screens, I find that water is not repelled by the screen.  It still comes in.  I have not had rain on the other screens, but the water repelling screens allow rain to hit the glass, where it seems to remain far longer than glass with no screen.  A minor annoyance, until the water dries. My final comment would be about the price structure.  I am sure that people who need full height screens to cover both upper and lower windows, are very happy.  However, for those of us who only need half a screen to cover the lower window only, we are not so happy with the price.  It would be nice if there were different prices for smaller screens.The reason I purchased these screens was that they were my only choice.  I had installation of roll-down storm shutters (Puerto Rico) and they left absolutely no room to remove the original screens for cleaning without bending the frame.  I am happy to have these screens available and love how they do not obstruct the view.  I hope that they hold up to many years of trouble free use. Shipping was fast and the screens fit perfectly."

Once submitted said I would receive in 10-15 working days but holy cow I received my 10 screens the following Wednesday just 5 days later counting the weekend. Everything came as ordered and clearly marked on each screen which window they went in. Couldn't have been easier.Before ordering I had contacted flex screen by email with questions on 2 different occasions and Mike was quick to respond each time with my questions clearly answered so customers service seems on the ball ,also. Measure carefully and follow flex screen's instructions and screens should pop right into place as shown on videos. Do not measure your old screens or you will  have problems. Can't speak to longevity since I have had less than a week but should hold up for years to come."

Installation was a snap, and every screen fit nice and snug. Excellent product.

The ordering process is super easy and they send you a tool to get precise measurements. I had to call customer service as I made an error on my input page and Mike was so helpful! Our screens arrived within a week and the are beautiful."

We have casement windows so ours don't have pockets (tracks) but they have the perfect measurements and solutions for every window type. When we moved into the house, the workers told us there was no way to install window screens and I'm glad they are wrong.  I will be ordering a few more for other windows. They are a bit pricy but the quality is great and the service is fast and easy."
