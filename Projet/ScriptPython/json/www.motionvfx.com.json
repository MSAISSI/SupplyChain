          "Contenu": "They introduced a subscription model that is forcing people who already own most of the products in their subscription service (paid in full before the subscription was released) to pay a monthly fee to access new plugins. Why would i and many others like me want to pay a monthly fee to use software we already own just to access 2-3 plugins that we dont. Just a money grab from a company who were the best. I will now be looking to alternative suppliers for my video editing plugins since you wont sell me individual products anymore. Your new model sucks for those like me who have spent $1000's with you over the years."

          "Contenu": "\"This subscription world that MotionVFX just launched is coming from the same place as You\u2019ll own nothing and be happy!Rentals...Feudalism...Peasants we all...\" (Quote from an FCP FB group)As a very loyal customer of MVFX I'm deeply disappointed and very angry about their new business decision which is basically a gigantic meaty slap in the face to the customers but MVFX just call it like: \"The next logical step...\" So I personally own almost every single plugin they have released and spent 1000s of dollars over the years. I was so excited about their new upcoming products (mTracker Surface & mRotoAI) and I was going to buy them too without any hesitation until I found out it is available via subscription ONLY - not even an option to buy it. So basically they just bundled these 2 new products with their other older plugins which I personally own them all and now force me to pay 350$ per year just to get access to the new ones and some future expansions which will be also available via sub ONLY and call this bundle like \"it is just a new product release which you don't have buy\". Anyway, me and SO MANY others are still in shock about the way MVFX tried to hide all of this as it'll be a new plugin release until the very last moment while kept us customers so excited about it and the biggest offer they could come up with at the end was to give us extra 3 months for free to the subscription model that no-one wanted in the first place. Not to mention that with this move I got treated no different from someone buying from MVFX anything the first time today so tell me why should I keep supporting this company in the future? I feel so betrayed by MVFX and they made me hate myself for investing so much money for an uncertain future where I'll probably have to pay subscription to keep my current plugins I own to get updated - even if they now promise that it won't happen like that. I just don't understand why MVFX isn't happy to give one-time payment option as well to their loyal customers who already proved the fact THAT THEY WOULD/WILL SUPPORT MVFX IN THE FUTURE WITHOUT FORCING THEM WITH BS SUBSCRIPTION MODELS ONLY?\"Also they lied... They told everyone in the MO2 FB group, who had lost the ability to use the MO2 software (basically everyone) not to worry. They were working on something even better! It was MO3! And that it would be worth the wait! Never mind the fact that for many who had paid good money for their software, the only way they could continue to use the software was to in fact retrograde their operating system. A process that for many was just another series of obstacles that they, the consumer, would have to bear the responsibility for. They even told us in this group that those customers of MO2 would be able to acquire MO3 at a discounted price considering that our current software that we gave them money for, was non functional. Never, never, did they ever once tell anyone that MO3 would now be Paywalled behind a subscription service. These guys are fleece merchants. Now they tell you, that if you let them screw you out of even more money, that now this time, they will support their products. See before, they couldn't support them because you weren't giving them enough money. But now with this new business model, have no fear. They will now support and deliver. See how this works.\" (Quote from MO2 FB group) I\u2019m just trying to wrap my head around the logic of \"We must go subscription to survive!\"- Okay, so can I give you some money AGAIN by continuing to purchase your product just like I've been doing over the years to support you even if you keep your subscription models as a choice?- No, you can not. I would rather lose you forever no matter how much support you gave us over the years...- Ok, well, good bye then!"

          "Contenu": "This company is absolutely a SCAM; stay away from their products. I bought my plugin for the final cut, and two months ago, I switched to Davinci because of color grading. The biggest problem with these plugins is that they are made only for one platform. To be changed, you must pay again for 100% of the products from different editing programs. Which I feel is a total scam on people; in the editing world, people switch constantly.  Guys, stay away from them until they find a way to solve this problem because your investment in those plugins is for nothing. If you care for people, find a way to pay a small price for switching the same product on different platforms, especially in the editing world. Remember, Jeff Bezos became the most successful person in the world because he applied simple rules, and the customer was always right. I wasted 600 USD for you, and now I can't even use it on Davinci because you didn't even find a way to switch for a small price. Again, I DO NO NEED to PAY 100% for THE SAME PRODUCT; that's only if you are trying to scam customers, which you guys do."

          "Contenu": "They have great videos showcasing their add-ons but once it's time to use the add-on yourself it's a coin toss if it actually works at all after purchasing. I'm strictly referring to MotionVFX products for DaVinci Resolve. They have good response times for product support. I know this because half the time I apply the add-on onto the timeline it doesn't work and I have to contact their support. They'll simply tell me I'm using an outdated version of the add-on. But....Before I contact support, I always visit the mInstaller desktop app to check if there is an updated version...the support staff will passively aggressively shift the error on the user for not using the most up to date version. Perhaps they get the same problems repeatedly and they don't care as much. It's great that MotionVFX supports DaVinci Resolve, but it's extremely buggy and doesn't work half the time and the install is usually missing fonts. I don't know if this happens to the FCP add-ons, but it's routinely inconsistent for DaVinci Resolve. Their quality control is terrible, their support staff respond timely but they'll shift any error onto the user.It's probably best to buy their products if it's been on the market for a really long while. Their newest products don't work well at launch if at all."

The only two reasons I am deducting one star from my rating are - the hefty price tags (only works if you are patient enough to wait for discount codes) - which I somehow understand as they charge a premium price for a premium product \ud83d\ude22- the installer routine, you have to use their mInstaller plugin, which likely makes the installs very controllable for them but is a bit annoying on the user side \ud83e\udd2c but this isn't a show stopper.All in all I am happy with Motion VFX and hope for sume stuff from their Final Cut family to be translated into Davinci Resolve."

          "Contenu": "Incredible products and service at Motion VFX. Had some trouble with missing fonts and within a few minutes we were able to solve the issue with the amazing help team. Its truly incredible that on a basic M1 MacBook Air using FCPX editing complex timelines (10 bit 4k footage) and throwing all these incredible plugins that it still works so smoothly. I do use proxy files to get the speed working seamlessly but still- its game changing to work so quickly with these plugins. A big fan of mDocumentary and mDiary plugins as you can add just a touch of a flare, lens blur and beautiful titles to add an enormous amount of value to your footage. I will say however that FCPX (with my setup) is indeed faster than Davinci resolve, as I tried both and opted for FCPX. Motion VFX ROCKS!"

Faster, more stable, in short definitely improved (both Intel and Silicon). Unfortunately in my case I had problems opening some projects built with the previous versions of the app/plugin. After a few failed tests I contacted customer support to explain the problem. And... within a few days BOOM! Resolved! I would like to point out that it is not to be taken for granted that a singular problem is quickly addressed and successfully resolved within a short period of time, which thanks to the Motionvfx developers, it was.

It helped to do a shared viewer through TeamViewer. He was able to go to work and find the solution within minutes. We probably should've done that from the start and regardless, my plug-ins are working smoothly.

          "Contenu": "Flawless products, visually and technically. MotionVFX cover the standard range of titles, transtions, presets for colour grading, etc. that you'll find elsewhere, with the exception of their 3D packs (which I haven't tried yet but they look fantastic).Stylistically, though, they're a cut above other providers. They're consistently, noticeably cleaner and sharper than their competitors, and also much more reliable. If it breaks, they can fix it, and if something isn't going to work (a modular template with the latest version of FCP, for example) they tell you BEFORE you buy. Customer service is lightning quick, friendly, and helpful. If you're considering a purchase they can enable certain elements on your account manually and they become available as soon as you sign in. Price-wise, yes, probably the most expensive you'll come across, but you do get what you pay for. Personally I try to bundle packages that I know I'm going to buy eventually and that gets you a discount at checkout (15% on three items, 30% on five). Even without the discount I'd still be a happy customer, but it gives a little bit more incentive and you won't regret it once you start playing around on the timeline.TL;DR: Fairly expensive, but I won't use anyone else now. Highly, highly recommended."

Mostly, the tech support I needed was because I was being an idiot and the answer was right in front of me. This last time though, it had to do with an FCPX update that effected a few plugins. Jakub was right there for me.Heartfelt thanks Jakub!Cheers,Skye Reno"
