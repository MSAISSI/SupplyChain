I was told the saber will be shipped in 7-10 days. I was then informed that the shipping time would be increased by 2 more weeks.The 2 weeks went by and I did not receive any updates from Dx Sabers. I sent a few e:mails asking for an update to the status of my order and silence has been their reply.This situation has continued for the past 7 months.My e:mail requests are rarely answered, their promises or never fulfilled and I have been waiting to receive my refund for 4 months.I have sent 76 professionally worded e:mails and have received only 12 replies.Today i discovered that my e:mail capability has been blocked by Dx Sabers. I am no longer able to send an e:mail or reply to any previous e:mails.In my OPINION Dx Sabers is a dishonest company concerned only with taking your money and leaving their customers out to dry."

We did not receive any proper and functional products from DXSabers and the experience overall feels like a scam 100%. Our only good experience from purchasing sabers for our entire family came from another company at this event that also helped us with our issues with DX products. The fact that they had to give us entirely different sabers that actually work properly and are assembled correctly shows that there are great companies out there that do care about us. DXSabers is not one of them and the owner is a liar and a thief that will not respond to emails. We support all of the reviews here that show them for what they are."

Even when I requested new/more screws, they also didn't fit and took months to even receive them along with the rest of my order that they seemingly ran out of to send.If you are someone who is very patient and willing to send an email every two weeks to get gaslit and false hope for when orders will be sent, then go for it. They make a lot of promises but either don't follow through or wait for you to give up. They seem to blame customers instead of changing their practice which feels very scammy.

They actually had the nerve to email me again 5/13/22 (6 months since my last communication with them, which was to request a refund and almost a year after placing the order) telling me my order will be ready now, if I could only send them more money to cover additional shipping costs they incurred. My original order was $500 USD with FREE shipping. I received nothing and no refund. Being from Canada, there is little recourse for me to continue pursuing the matter.

The Leia was missing multiple screws, had stripped threads on multiple areas, and the emmiter was literally falling out. My Dark Saber stops working randomly, switches profiles randomly, and has sound issues galore. Both sabers are poorly machined, have very sharp edges, and overall feel cheap.The owner was apparently removed from the event, or left early to avoid selling underwhelming products, as he was not present the very next day and another saber vendor handled making sure that we were taken care of and gave us this owner's contact information. The owner has not replied to any of our emails and we will absolutely never deal with this company again.We were made aware of this site by fellow saber community members and wish that we had this information earlier.

          "Contenu": "Two bad experiences with this company. Initially around two years ago I purchased two base lit sabers, that were meant to come with a bunch of extra things (kyber crystal and a few other things). It took months and months of being told \"they're shipping next week\" before they finally arrived. One didn't have the promised smooth swing, and the praetorian didn't have any holes drilled for the screws to secure the core, and the core was in pieces with a broken speaker. I found communication with them extremely difficult and ended up just accepting it was a bad purchase and left it at that.In February this year I noticed they had been really trying hard and apologising on social media, so I thought I'd give it another try. I ordered two proffie mystery boxes, and then waited 9 months for my product to arrive. Again getting the usual \"they'll be shipping next week!\"When they arrived, one was a baselit, again not even with smooth swing, and the second one was a broken neopixel, that very clearly wasnt a proffie, since it lacked a memory card. It took about a month to get a response, which basically boiled down to \"sorry, sent it back at your cost\".I believe in giving small businesses opportunities, and everyone deserves a second chance. Really wanted you guys to do amazingly the second time around, but it was just more of the same unfortunatly.Very long waiting times.Poor customer service.Orders were wildly incorrect, and products were not as advertised.Products were broken and poorly put together both times I placed orders.On the plus side they're a good price and the empty hilts I now have are quite good looking!Would recommend you avoid this company unless you're desperate."

          "Contenu": "Update - 12/10/2023As I mentioned - scammers. They have the nerve to lie on their response and I will not tolerate that. My package was NEVER mailed out. What they sent was a \u201cpre transit\u201d label to which was never updated and still not. Every few weeks I receive a promise of \u201cyour cores came in and they are in their way\u201d no cores. No actual reply to my many emails asking them for an updated number and over 2 months later no cores. We have empty shells with no electronics to make it work. They keep promising with no delivery. 2 light sabers have no cores. I paid for it already with cash. Then they have the NERVE to send me email promising me it was mailed out and ASKING ME TO REMOVE my one star review. I will do no such thing because I still do not have the product which I was promised and PAID FOR OVER 2 MONTHS LATER! You want good reviews ? Do your job and do it well. Don\u2019t make false promises and don\u2019t you dare come in with a reply to very well deserved one star review and try to lie your face off. If I could give you a negative star I would at this moment. If you actually have it and shipping from the US it doesn\u2019t take 2 months. I don\u2019t care where your shipment comes from, you lied about that too. China. Not the US eh? Want it removed? Send my son his light saber cores for his 2 light sabers now and stop making false promises and flat out lying WITH A REAL apology and actual omission of why you keep lying. Until then believe nothing this company claims. They are great at ignoring people when they want. Original review on the bottom, I will NOT remove. Horrible company. Do not believe the \u201cgood reviews\u201d they have been banned from numerous places / events due to their shady business practices. Take note of how they have their \u201cexcuses\u201d in the replies for bad customer service. We met them at a Comic Con event on Sat Oct 14. They sold us 2 light sabers but did not have the electronics on hand. Swore and promised up and down how it would be mailed out on Tuesday and arrive the Friday. Promised my 14 year old child. Friday came and went. No tracking. No nothing. I entered my information into the owners phone because he didn\u2019t have anything to provide me with a receipt. Either way, no replies. Days later a reply with some cock and bull story of how their shipment was delayed from China, etc etc. after numbers back and forth, mostly from myself checking in, still no parts. Sent me a \u201ctracking number\u201d 2 weeks later with no actual shipment attached. More BS. My poor son has an empty shell of a light saber. And yes, I have ALL THE EMAIL EXCHANGES BACK AND FORTH FOR PROOF. They are just shady salesmen who don\u2019t deliver. Stay away, safe your money and buy elsewhere. They guys are a sham. Read the bad reviews and believe those."

First the company odly sent me 2 reviews of my order before I ever even received it. During that time I reached out to Dx sabers a couple times to get no response in terms of just order status as why would I receive the review before the product. I never got a response from Dx sabers. Finally after a couple of months which I will say I did expect as I understand it\u2019s a small company. However they did at the time state the response would be in 24 hours it was almost 2 months and no response. When the saber finally arrived, I ordered the Luke skywalker one, I opened it and it was clearly not as advertised, it looked entirely different than the picture. The picture was a chrome blade with an additional peice at the top, mine was a black steel color and no peice at the top. I also had issues getting it to work because the style they sent me was differnt again than the order and had no instructions on the website or the box. Also sent multiple e mails for help and again no response. It has now been 4 months sense I received the wrong product from Dx sabers and also when it arrived legitimately every peice was loose, was clear zero level of quality assurance went into this product. I have been emailing now for months and finally took a break , again giving the company the benefit of the doubt which they clearly have not deserved. So I decided after not looking into it for over a month I would logon and check the status of the now over 20 messages of communication I have sent. The website states an account does not exist for my email. I had to now reset up my account which I used in the first place because Dx sabers for some odd reason deleted the account. Now I still have the same gifted saber that was wrong and loose, no communication and my account t was deleted. Single handed the worst and most shady client experiance I have ever had. My advice is to order somewhere else, clearly this company is in over there head and there promise for customer service is just quite frankly a lie and should be removed from there website. I want my money back Order 2556"

Would love any feedback or estimate of how long this will be.Edited same day as posted. How can yall respond at 9am immediately after my first email and not at all now? Do not trust this company anymore, send my saber back to my address.So update. After I left bad service comments that's when they decided to make it a public post for all customer to stop spamming their email. Got on BBB and got the guys phone number and refused to speak to me on the matter. After that finally gotten a email back on how I should be ashamed of myself and how rude I was being. I will say I was passive aggressive due to the lack of communication and how they made it seem like I was the problem. Later they seen I have discovered the truth about the company and I learn of these \"hate groups\" when all they did was show facts on the matter of who DX Sabers really is. Last email was that I was scamming them, when I sent them my broken saber, and just so much nonsense. I did go on to each fb page and other communication to get there attention, and instead of asking me to stop they blocked me. They wanna play victim when they're creating victim of their company. Sorry if piled all together just really wanna get my point across. They don't care for your satisfaction.And they're reply is wrong. I wanna pay for shipping and never sent the link! I stated in my last email I was gonna pay. They never responded. I guess calling the local authorities for theft is my option if they don't send me this tracking info"

I only disputed PART of my charges because I felt it only correct to dispute what I felt what I got was worth. Only decent humans would do that. That being said, I still would stay as far away from this company as possible. Poor business practices, and many promises made with none of them being kept. The only reason to buy from them, is if you don't mind losing your money.EDIT : Updating this review. After purchasing one via their website, getting the light saber that didn't match the pictures, was told the missing pieces would be shipped \"next week\" for over a month, was told the promos and other items would be shipped \"next week\" multiple times that it became a broken record. Realize that this guy is scamming people. He will get a few people sabers at a con, bug them to come here and write a positive review, and then ignore those that order online, or if he does deliver, it's a product that is much lower quality, may not match the pictures, and as someone who HAS taken them apart....a fire hazard inside due to poor electrical construction. I regret purchasing from him, and trusting his word over the many reviews and claims online. Claims those people are just haters, or 'have issues at home', or any one of many reasons to make him seem like he's being wronged.....Do yourself (and your wallet) a favor and believe what others say. Original Review Below :Met them at Thygeekdom con. Purchased both a neopixel saber and a mystery box on the spot. They had to actually go back to their shop, nearby, and he upgraded the hilt I wanted with a neopixel setup. That being said, the neopixel saber is fantastic. The smoothness of it, everything about it is fantastic. I love the effects, and everything about it. I'm concerned about durability, but this saber is more a prop for costumes than it is one for play.The mystery box I bought was a RGB lit saber, and while I did have some minor issues out of the box, it was easily remedied with some email support.While the email support wasn't immediate responses, I didn't have to wait longer than 48 hours for any response during the normal work week."

          "Contenu": "I had originally purchased two lightsabers from DXSabers back in May 2022 on Mercari. I used them for a convention that I attended in July and discovered that one of the lightsabers ran out of power very quickly. After reaching out to the company on Instagram, I was told that the lightsabers have a \"lifetime warranty\" and that they would replace my lightsaber at no extra cost. At the time I was thinking to myself that this would be perfect, since I planned to attend New York Comic Con that following October and would need them in working condition for my cosplay.Fast forward to the rude email I received after reaching out to them about my exchange, and poor interactions I had with the company on Instagram. I sent my lightsaber back to them weeks before Comic Con, knowing that I needed to receive a new one back in time. Not only did they forget to package the entire lightsaber when sending it back to me, but the following package that they sent with the missing blade and attachment piece didn't arrive in time for the convention.The person who I was conversing with on Instagram frequently refused to respond to me, prompting my partner to have to reach out to them in order to get a reply. I find it entirely misogynistic and disrespectful for them to ignore me and that my partner had to go out of his way in order to maintain some kind of communication with them. I was never once rude to them in my conversations with them, and simply wanted a working lightsaber to use for my cosplay. Instead, I was promptly ignored and met with so much unprofessionalism that I didn't even have any motivation to attend Comic Con that day.I still have not received a reply from them after reaching out one more time and told them that I would write an honest review about my poor experience with their company. I will be taking my business elsewhere."

So, I decided to buy them through their online store the next chance I got. It ended up taking 7 months for me to receive my sabers. Customer service was very polite\u2026once I finally got a hold of them. I had to reach out to them for any updates on my order. They were rarely (if at all) the first ones to give me any updates. Any update I would get just seemed like excuse after excuse. Even up to the shipping of the order. They sent me a tracking number and my order still didn\u2019t ship for another month. Kept getting the \u201cIt will be sent out this week\u201d or \u201cSo sorry for the delay. You should be treated like family and we are doing our best\u201d. Or something along those lines. Got promises of free accessories AND a free saber for my patience. None of which came with my order. When I reached out about the lack of extra things that were promised. I got the same excuses of they\u2019ll go out this week each week I asked about it. Finally did get some free accessories but never got that extra saber they promised, and they never acknowledged it again either. Now, I wish I could say the sabers were at least worth the cost, but I really can\u2019t. Took them to a con for the first time and one was a constant struggle to work. Pretty sure both died before my friend\u2019s sabers too, but then they miraculously were acting normal again without being charged. So not sure what\u2019s going on there. Both kept falling apart, one was just pieces and the other was completely in half. Just not worth it when walking around a con all day."

Buyer Beware  Purchased a NeoPixel Dark Saber August 25th at Botcon from DX Sabers - Paid $424 via square.  Asked if they could ship it to me since I had other stuff to carry home.  They pleasantly agreed to do so.Aug 31st - No pressure, just asked what the usual time before it ships.  No response.Sept 6th.  - Contacted again.  Told I would get tracking 'Right away' Sept 7th - Asked what 'right away' meant.  Told I would get it 'later tonight'. Sept 8th - Contacted let them know I didn't get it.  No response.Sept 9th.  Contacted let them know I dididn't get it.  No response.  Stated I didn't want this to go down a negative route.  But at this point had already learned about their bad reputation.  Responded and said they were 'at another con' but would get it 'later tonight'.  Told them if they were unable I'd be fine with a refund.  Said they 'stand by their word' but it had just been a crazy couple weeks.Sept 10th.  Contacted as I hadn't heard back as they promised.  Another round of 'they were really tired but can guarantee he'd give me hourly updates(not sure why or how) given that he also stated his factory in china didn't open until the next day.Sept 11th.  Got a tracking number.Sept 15th.  Got a cheap hollow core round non-distinct saber.  Contacted them and they condescended and said 'you seem to forget we promised you a mystery saber with your purchase'.  I wasn't asking for the mystery saber to be sent.  I was asking for the Dark Saber I spent $424 on.  Told them I was disappointed because they never mentioned they were only sending out the cheap 'freebie' instead of what I actually ordered.  They defended saying they always answered me promptly when I had a concern.  Also said I'd receive tracking Monday on the Dark Saber.Sept 19th - Tuesday and no tracking.  Contacted.  No response.Sept 20th - Wednesday and no tracking.  Contacted.  No response.Sept 21st - Emailed and said their sons wer sick but that I'd have tracking in 24 hrs.Sept 23rd - No tracking after 48 hours.  Contacted.  No response.Sept 24th - Fed up I emailed and said I didn't know what to do here other than to pursue means to get my money back and warn others.  Told them if I didn't have tracking by Monday night I'd send the 'freebie' back to them on my dime and expect a refund.  They responded talking about the kids being sick again.  Hey I get it, I had 6 kids.  But I also am asking for nothing more than that they tell me when its going to ship and actually do so.  They give me a tracking number that doesn't show dropped off.Sept 26th - I email fed up because it doesn't show dropped off.  I stick to what I said on the 24th and I put the freebie in the mail and send them proof I dropped it off via USPS tracking.  I get a frenzied response pack and was told they were mistaken it actually sent through UPS and was given yet another tracking number.  I track it and that show that the destination is a completely other state and shows at .4 lbs.  When the Neopixel is over 2lbs just for the hilt alone.  Then I was told no, that's wrong it actually went USPS.  And to check.  It finally showed dropped off.Sept 28th - Finally get it in the mail.   It comes without a box for either the hilt or the blade.  Both were loose in a previously used and shipped plain brown box.  The hilt and blade were scared/marred.  No charging cable.  Tried using a charging cable I have and it wouldnt' charge.  Either it busted because it was shipped completely loose or they shipped me a saber already used and broken.I have all emails and text messages and pictures.  I waited over a year for my Moducase no problem.  Why?  Because they were forthright on what to expect.  Hell, we wait all the time for preorders as collectors.  But this was never about waiting.  This was about people who continually told me one thing and did another...or rather didn't.  At this point I just want others to know not to trust this company or anything they say or do"

I was told shipping was free but had to pay $75 when I went to pick it up. At the time Paul was claiming they built all their sabers themselves even tho mine clearly had \u201889 Sabers\u2019 written on it and the images he used on the DX site were lifted straight off the Alibaba site. He then told me that since they were \u2018making\u2019 a new model mine was a one of a kind, a laughable, outright lie. When I received my near 600$ saber the speaker was blown, the blade didn\u2019t fit and the battery include was generic and dangerous. After approximately 3 months the saber quit working all together. In the past few weeks this site has been inundated with positive reviews, many of them double and even triple reviews from some people. This is typical as Paul offers discounts and free merchandise to people who leave positive reviews. If you read carefully you\u2019ll notice some reviews mention only customer service (user hasn\u2019t received defective product yet) or intent to buy (user hasn\u2019t even purchased yet). Please do your research before purchasing from DX, there are many respectable saber builders to choose from.Edit after Paul\u2019s reply:I purchased my saber 2 years ago, not 3. Paul\u2019s first lie in his response to this review.I received no offers for DX to replace or any other offer in reference to my issues. Why wouldn\u2019t I accept a refund if it had been offered? Paul\u2019s second lie.I have not harassed any customers of DX. In fact I have screen caps of Paul asking me harass other individuals (or \u2018put them on blast\u2019 in his words) while I was feigning support for DX to try and expedite shipment of my saber. Paul\u2019s third lie.  I have never mentioned Paul\u2019s wife in any post. All business decisions are Paul\u2019s and Paul\u2019s alone and he is ultimately responsible for the actions of the company. Paul\u2019s fourth lie.The only social media where I have talked about DX is on the Facebook page \u2018DX Sabers Exposed\u2019 where the multitude of dissatisfied customers gather to discuss the abhorrent business practices of DX Sabers amongst ourselves and seek professionals to help repair the substandard products we received. I have not said anything online about DX besides on the that page -with the exception of this honest review- certainly not on \u2018every social media platform\u2019 as I only have a Facebook and Instagram.  This Paul\u2019s fifth lie.LGT is the one that severed ties with DX after blowback from customers. A statement from LGT can be found on their site. Paul\u2019s sixth lie.Referring to a negative review as \u2018spite\u2019 and attacking reviewers is straight out of the DX disinformation playbook. This post is not spite, this is to assist others before their purchase. You\u2019ll notice similar responses from him on all reviews from other dissatisfied customers. Paul\u2019s seventh lie. Seven lies from DX in one online reply. Typical. As for DX not soliciting reviews with incentives, scroll down and you\u2019ll see bulk positive reviews across single days, June 11th for example. Coincidence? Yeah, I didn\u2019t think so either.UPDATE: Paul continues to make outrageous claims such as he has been threatened with death or rape (!) or kidnapping. Any rational person can see through these wild claims, the man is a delusional criminal who has caused serious damage to the saber community. I encourage anyone who is considering a purchase to visit DX SABERS EXPOSED on face book or visit the Saber Souce website entry on this company. Please, shop elsewhere!!"

          "Contenu": "UPDATE: Paul, I did in fact order from your company. I have communicated with you multiple times over email, Facebook, and Instagram in the past 9 months. Please refrain from gaslighting your customers. As someone who preaches \"be kind to others\", maybe you should take your own advice. You are correct many companies have a 30-day return policy, and usually, those 30 days start when the item is received. Not ordered. It took over 5 months for you to ship me my hilt. You would not take the return when it arrived broken. How can you have a return policy that is up before you even send the product out?!As for your claim about shipping labels, yes you are correct that you pay for the label when it is created. However, you all you need to do is go into your UPS dashboard and click \"void shipment\" and UPS will refund your money. I know this because I also have a UPS account. You can create HUNDREDS of tracking numbers, then void them, and get your money back. Your claim that none of your customers have had to file claims with their bank is also false, because I had to do just that. Additionally, there are other firsthand accounts of having to do just that from many other who you have scammed. All people need to do is look up DX Sabers on Facebook or YouTube and they will find a great many useful reviews of your business practices.  In summary, I have indeed ordered from your company, and I have been scammed by you, just like countless others. I am stuck with a nonworking saber that you have refused to help fix or refund me for. I had to go through the arduous process of claiming fraud with my bank. Once I provided them with screenshots of our communications, my claim was processed, and I finally got my money back. You have blocked me on all your social media and my emails have now gone unanswered for a month, so I assume you blocked me there as well. If you truly want to become a better company, you will start being honest with your customers. You are STILL reselling LGT hilts, despite your claim to the contrary. (At least as of 4 months ago when I received my \"Hatred of Ren\" with a Proffie board clearly labeled \"Darkwolf & LGT Saber Studios\" on it, and a battery that is labeled \"Saber Studio\")PLEASE DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY!!ORIGINAL REVIEW:One star is too many! Paul and DX are known scammers in the industry. You need to look no further for proof than one of the most recent reviews where the review was written by Paul himself!! He makes fake accounts and gives himself glowing reviews to con unsuspecting and naive people into giving him money. If you order from DX, you will be lucky to receive your saber at all. Paul's predatory \"refund\" policy states that you can only request a refund within 30 days of ordering. Yet the shipping estimate on his website is at least 6 weeks. He will string you along by sending you fake tracking numbers, or even going so far as to print a real shipping label, but never actually drop the package off. By the time you realize that you have been conned, it is far beyond the 30 days that you ordered and now you have to file a fraud claim with your credit card company. Bottom line is DO NOT, EVER, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY."

          "Contenu": "Paul doesn't keep his shipping times and when you approach him about what's going on with the shipment he will give you attitude and get defensive and tell you to be patient without doing anything. Then when you're saber arrives it's a broken mess and you confront him with that. He says you broke it even though you just took it out of the box and it had no packaging or any type of securement. Everything was just strewn about the bottom was literally broken off in the speaker was hanging out. Terrible experience for a $300 mystery box. Currently in dispute with my bank because I can't send it back in the mail because it melted when I tried to turn it on because he crosswired it.EDIT AFTER PAULS REPLYPaul everything you said in that reply is a lie I have video evidence of the box coming out of the post office in the one single box at the saber comes in unless you're saying eye doctored government footage as well. I only got nervous and started asking questions when the package didn't show up when you said it would and then you got very defensive and stopped responding. You never asked for any video evidence of anything. As soon as I told you that I got the saber and it starts smoking when I turned it on. You immediately accuse me of breaking it and said I did it on purpose. I made an unboxing video and showed no foam or anything. You literally don't understand that when you do this Paul that some people actually have evidence against you. So when you make these allegations that everything's faults, you should probably make sure that these people don't have proof of doing what you are doing. I haven't even gotten the refund from my bank as it takes time to do the investigation so that's false as well. You're just refusing to refund because this is how you do business. You send out busted savers to people and then they return them to you to get fixed and then they never get them back. There's a reason why there's literally hundreds of these types of reviews on your site and all over the internet because you are a dishonest business personNobody and I repeat nobody talk to me about going to buy one of their savers. I did my research after you ripped me off and found a reputable company and guess what? I got my saber in the condition that it should have been in from you.The fact that you have to sit here and write short story reviews to these. Only kind of tells people that you are lying. I'm really truly disgusted by your behavior. Paul, especially when you try to use my veteran status to try to push your company. I know that was your plan because you were very adamant about me making a video and sharing it to you unboxing it. I know how you do business you drop ship so you don't order the saber until someone actually buys it and then you order it from another company. And the reason why my package didn't show up on time is because your dropship package from China didn't show up on time and so when I started the refund you just threw in some junk saber and threw it in a box so you could try to check that and cover yourself with my bank because you hadn't sent out my product because usually you like to wait for people to wait months until it's outside the chargeback. But I being a combat veteran and a purple heart holder have way way more sense than most and I don't let people off the chain with that kind of money. Paul says I broke the saber yet when I took it out of the box and I literally put the saber blade into it and turned it on. It starts smoking. I opened it up and looked at the core and the thing was just hotwired literally broken. The speaker was hanging out the bottom out of the box. No foam in it. Like I said everything Paul said in his reply to my comment was a lie. This is how this guy does business and it's pretty sad especially trying to use my disability as a veteran to try to say that's why I canceled my order which is total bsOh brandondale didn't tell me to do anything. He was just the guy that offered to try to make things right for me after you sent me something that literally caught fire trying to blame him for trying to do something right saying he orchestrated it. It's just a lie and honestly pretty pathetic of you. Paul. Take some responsibility for your actions.Also, Paul, I have all the copies of our email correspondence and you stopped responding to me when I told you that it came and damaged and it melted when I tried to turn it on and smoked and then you immediately accuse me of breaking it and cut off all communication with me. So don't try to say that I stopped replying to your emails when you offered to help because the help never was offered. And again I have all our email correspondence. I don't know why you think you can get away with all these faults things when people have evidence proving everything they say is 100% right DISGUSTING AVOID THIS COMPANY especially if you don't want a product that catches fire."

I got ahold of a different service rep in late December and she was helpful to an extent. Other than telling me I could make a return she didn't tell me how or give me any useful info on how to make sure they knew it was my saber arriving. So in February after being ignored for a month and a half I payed 35$ to ship my lightsaber back to Dx Sabers with my order slip to verify its mine. It has been in their possession for 2 weeks now and all of my social media, and 3 emails have been blocked as I asked for my refund for the broken 380$ lightsaber I returned to them. I got fed up and opened up a fraud case with my bank and they are now arguing to win my money back for me.

I believed for awhile that the owner of the company (Paul) was a very kind and professional business owner which I respected as an entrepreneur myself. Well... I was mistaken. After asking a few times for order updates I just kept getting dragged on and spoon fed lies which is rather unfortunate. After doing my research via reddit, google, etc, I came to find out that their supplier cut them off a couple months ago. I personally think the worst part is that he's taken down his google review page and tries to fabricate his reviews which is just a scummy business practice in my opinion. Not to mention, it's virtually impossible to get a refund because this guy will go ghost and the banks won't allow for it, especially if you've been waiting as long as I have. The only reason this isn't a 1 star review is because I do believe Paul is a nice guy with good intentions for the star wars community, but there's obviously been issues with suppliers, customer support, falsified reputation, and company staff. DX Sabers has got a lot to figure out, and I highly recommend pursuing a more reliable company for the time being whether you're a collector or just someone who wants a dang lightsaber."

The hilt was missing screw holes to secure the core, the core was missing half of the chassis, the electronics were all over the place, it had no smooth swing, and the speaker was blown.After I contacted the customer service and providing a video, I was informed that I would have to return the product at my own cost, and send back the entire thing (accommodating the blade drastically increased the cost of the return).I hoped that this was just a small company struggling to get their feet on the ground, and wanted to help out a little. Everything that happened from the moment of my purchase was an exercise in what not to do, and I'm extremely disappointed with the service and product from DX Sabers.I recommend looking elsewhere for your sabers."

          "Contenu": "I had a pretty good experience with DXSabers. I reached out looking for a specific model without breaking the bank and they responded quick and assisted me. I pulled the trigger and purchased. I stumbled upon some tough reviews which made me nervous if I would even get the saber. The communication was pretty good. All in all, it took about 3-4 weeks to receive it. The USPS tracking was a little suspicious at first but after nudging DX via social media it got a move on. Receiving the package was a bit rough. The screws and wrench were out of the bag and it was pretty messy in the packaging. The charging cable was NOT included when it should have been. Putting the blade together with the saber was fine and the quality of the hilt is very nice. The instructions are definitely a little confusing and I have not figured out how to lower the volume (it says you can). I had to purchase my own charger which was upsetting because I did spend money for something that was supposed to be included in the costs. Overall, the hilt and blade are exceptional. The timeline was ok, just need to be able to provide accurate info and timelines to customers.  The customer service was good until the bit about my charger. The packaging needs improvement along with instructions for the saber. Additionally, DX uploaded a great video on social media explaining the company, what was going on, why everything was happening, etc etc. and as a consumer I could appreciate that. It helped make me understand what was going on on their side of things. I will likely purchase again."

          "Contenu": "Do I think DX is a total scam? Not necessarily. I received my saber but months after it\u2019s order. I originally ordered the Luke Skywalker (episode VI and mandalorian) hilt on June 18th under the guise that the saber I was purchasing was chromed based on the photos available on the site at the time. Unfortunately, DX did not inform me that the hilt I was expecting was no longer the hilt being produced nor available to be shipped. I had to wait throughout June, July, and august as the new hilts were being assembled. I cannot recall exactly when the website was updated the new hilt began to be advertised, but I can provide a purchase receipt with the original chrome hilt to authenticate my purchase. I maintained communication with DX throughout my edit, of which I appreciated and they were very good at responding. I could\u2019ve voiced my concern earlier but wanted to wait until I revive the saber as I wondered if i was alone in my confusion and alight disappointment that I did not receive the chromed hilt that I was led to believe was available on June 18th. The new hilt I received is very sturdy and doesn\u2019t have moving electronics. It\u2019s assembled well. The blade was 32\u201d however and I wasn\u2019t expecting that, I expected a standard 36\u201d blade. I don\u2019t think DX is totally scam, however, I do think they need to be less active on IG and more active in how they communicate as some other customers might be unintentionally led astray or receive incorrect information. Did I intentionally not receive a chrome hilt? I think so because I don\u2019t think any were available and at the time, that wasn\u2019t communicated on their site nor to me personally until the new hilts began production."

It took a little over 2 months to get a response ( I learned later there was an issue with their current customer support person). Eventually the owner began helping me through the whole process and explained what was going on. It still took around 6 months for me to receive my saber but I had semi-decent communication that whole time. But when the saber arrived oh man was it sweet.

I texted him for updates it took a while sometimes but delivered updating me with what\u2019s the problem. It did take a few months to get the saber and I love it. Think he upgraded me with I neopixel cause I could\u2019ve sworn I ordered it base lit but I\u2019m not complaining my first neopixel and I\u2019m loving it. I\u2019ve had the saber for a few months and it hasn\u2019t malfunctioned. Overall great hilt love the electronics and can\u2019t wait to met them in a couple weeks.

The quality of the sabers have been top notch; they've got a good weight to them, can withstand a drop on the ground, are great to engage in combat without feeling like you're about to bust the blade at contact and they look great both of our lit up. It took a little time trying to figure out how to use them, but there are instructions both on the website and printed that arrived with my sabers to help figure out how to use them.For the sabers I purchased online, they did take longer than expected, but the seller was attentive and tried to give the best ETA possible to keep me in the loop. They were also very open and willing to address any concerns and ready to fix any issues we encountered. I would probably recommend if buying online, to allow for extra time allowance in delivery and, if concerned, to immediately contact the seller to keep lines of communication open for regular updates, if needed.The sabers I purchased at a recent convention were exquisite, honestly love how they look and work, and could not stop waving them around and showing them off. If I'm ever at another convention where they are, I'll most probably be purchasing at least one or two more because they really are excellent"

          "Contenu": "I have not ordered from them yet, but from all that I\u2019ve seen so far, I\u2019d say that their sabers look to be made in great condition and their sabers are pretty cheap for Neopixel lightsabers. While other companies sell them for around $700, DX Sabers offer Neopixel sabers as low as $300 and that\u2019s a massive plus to me. Majority of the negative reviews I\u2019ve seen have been about delivery time and damaged product and what I will say to those is that not everything you order online will come 100% perfect every order. There\u2019s always gonna be complications and delays, not every time, but on small occasion. Especially with traveling and shipping, things can get damaged, so you can\u2019t completely blame a company for damages when you account for shipping distance and when it\u2019s in route to your home. Like I\u2019ve stated though I\u2019ve never ordered from them before, but I think the main thing is to just be positive and go into it with a positive mind."

          "Contenu": "Right after Christmas I ordered a mystery box from DX Sabers as I saw the controversy and I thought I'd give them a honest shot.I ordered it and after 6 weeks it didn't arrive so I contacted them, they replied basically immediately and informed me about delays that they were having due to a few reasons and my saber would be a week late.I am from the UK so I had to wait a extra week on top of this for the saber to arrive.Once the saber arrived I was very shocked to find a really nice saber hilt, I turned it on and it was genuinely really cool, it was bright, had basically very colour, multiple sound fonts, 3 light modes and even played music.I am very happy with what arrived and people saying it is a scam are lying, I feel that the money I spent was well worth it and the only reason it doesn't have a 5 is because of the delivery time. I ordered on the 29th December 2020 and it arrived on 8th March 2021.Cheers for the Saber, keep up the work.To prove I am real, my insta is @audegrien"

Paul and Brianne were quick to pick this issue up and rectify it, they sent me a neopixel blade with a decent amount of time, they've remained in contact throughout providing valuable updates on the situation. On my next order they will send out the original emitter that I ordered and a RGB saber as an apology, how could you fault customer service like that? I think people forget that these guys are human like the rest of us, they have lives, they're busy, they go to conventions, they might not be able to sort it on day one but they do sort it!

I highly recommend getting a saber, or two from DX Sabers. You won\u2019t regret it."

And again the lifetime warranty is the best thing about the product but my favorite thing is their durability If you're looking for a saber that is really combat ready This is the product i'm a very heavy handed person so I was thinking they will break easily but me and my friends have a several duels With them and no problems I rarely leave reviews for items but I think dxsabers may have earned themselves a lifetime customer.

A very small company that I suggest actually looking into with amazing customer service as well that tries to stay involved with their customers. I suggest you give them a shot as they are nothing like the bad reviews say they are but understand that at most there are 2 people working on the sabers so be patient. Definitely a 10/5 from me."

They have every replica you can think of or you can build your own. They are made of real metal, so they feel substantial and real in your hand. There are many colors to switch between,  so you're not just stuck with one. But what really blew my mind was that you can even change the sound effects. Ren's sounds to a normal saber to the dark saber. There is even laser deflection and crossed saber effects. They also play music like the theme and Imperial March!You can tell the owner and designer, Paul is passionate about his work because it shows in the quality. I would highly recommend these if you are a collector, fan, or even a flow artist."

Brianne was very helpful in emails ensuring I got my saber as quick as possible and made me feel that I was a customer and not an order number. I can't wait when I get my home to mount this on my wall."

I requested to have it before Christmas, and as they promised, I have received it.  It's going to be a amazing upgrade."

Great sabers, had a lot of fun battling with them.  Definitely battled ready and tested."

The sound effects are authentic, and the variety of colours allows you to feel like a Jedi or Sith or anything in between. I should also mention I had a slight issue with my order so I promptly reached out to them to check in. I can safely say they wanted to do everything they could to make the situation right and they did just that. They have amazing customer service and I would not hesitate to reach out to them again.If your considering purchasing a saber, I highly recommend Dxsabers. You will get an excellent saber in return for a great price that is ready for display or combat."
