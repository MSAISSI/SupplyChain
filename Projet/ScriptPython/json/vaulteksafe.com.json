The battery only lasts for around 6 days before being drained so low that the safe is inoperable unless I plug it into an outlet. If I had known the battery was that undersized for this safes application then I would have never wasted the money buying this battery. The site should say this battery will only hold charge for a week. Vaultek\u2019s customer service replied that this is normal for this model battery. Plus, the Vaultek website shows that my purchase should have been a VP3000 battery. They suggested I spend even more money to purchase a VP6000. No thanks. As the saying goes \u201cFool me once\u2026\u201dCustomer Service Rep said the website hasn\u2019t been updated to reflect that the VP3000 is no longer available.I have two Vaultek safes but I\u2019m seriously considering changing my gun storage devices.FOLLOW-UP TO REVIEWSept 20, 2023As expected, Vaultek Customer Service has not followed up with their e-mail promise to reach out to me for resolution of my poor experience with their battery\u2019s performance. The takeaway is that they sure don\u2019t mind taking your money, but when it comes to standing behind their products, they give public lip service then quickly disappear. Vaultek, please don\u2019t send out another hollow response to make prospective buyers believe you have real customer service. Just be real and stop posing as a supportive company and show what you\u2019ve become\u2026a one time sale company with no customer service."

          "Contenu": "To start their products are great, but the customer service is subpar to say the least. Being a company that make firearm safes and claim to support 2A, you would think that the company is for the people. This couldn't be furthest from the truth. On April 26, 2023 i ordered the \"smart station\" (which on the website showed to be in stock) intended to be a mothers day gift for my wife as she recently joined the 2A family a purchased her first hand gun. Going out of my way to ensure that the product would arrive before Mother's Day, I researched form the company's website that their listed shipping time was estimated to be 5 business days, in turn giving just about 3 weeks for product to reach me. On May 2, 2023 I received an email from vaultek stating...\"We wanted to make you aware of a shipping delay. Due to an internal error, we did not adequately display the correct shipping date. The display should have notified you at the time of checkout that all Titanium Gray and Alpine White Smart Stations will ship on, or around, 5/25.\"Immediately I got in contact with customer service and advised them of the extreme inconvenience this oversight on their part has caused me. The lack of empathy and compassion in which the company displayed towards my hardship was Sicking. I was basically told to go \"F\" off and wait, and when I requested to speak to a supervisor I was denied. This is a money hungry company who cares nothing about the American people or our right to bear arms. They only care about money, we are nothing but a number to them."

          "Contenu": "Cool Idea That Looks Good On Paper.Pro's:- Cool Idea and great looks- Supposedly no 'backdoor' access- Customer Service (so far and for myself anyway)Con's- Fingerprint reader (high False Rejection Rate)- Accessory fitments (not optimal and lacking, to say the least)- It's not a safe, more like a glorified storage cabinet like 'Secure-it'---Details Below---I thought I would go all out on an RS safe. It turns out I should have gone bare-bones basic (which is still fairly pricey for what an RS 'safe' is). Shipping was fine and I was excited to install my third attempt at a so-called \"safe.\" Will it keep kids out of it? Probably. Will it keep burglars out of it? Depends. A smart one will get into this thing in no time at all with minimal effort just by going in your garage and grabbing basic tools I'm sure any gun owner would have lying around. So time and noise are always somewhat of a deterrent, of course.When I first received the RS Series - RS800i PLUS Edition, there was a manufacturer defect with the electronics and LEDs. Vaultek CS was on point with return shipping and replacement. Thank you for that. Installing the new unit, I used 4 times longer fasteners and extra wide fender washers, to go into drywall/wood/then concrete, than what was provided. This thing won't be going anywhere now unless it's simply cut open and contents easily removed. Strongly recommend not using included hardware because I don't believe it to be long enough.The main selling point of this safe is probably the fingerprint reader, which is probably the worst and most frustrating thing. 20 different fingerprints are able to be read/programmed with the first two being master prints just case you run a risk of chopping off a finger; or to grant a loved one master access as well. The first testing result yielded horrible odds of a successful read (False Rejection Rate). The instructions do recommend for difficulty with fingerprint reading to program 4 or 5 of the same print to assist in the reader recognizing one print. This solution then leaves 15 to 16 different prints left to program and it still does not yield great results. I was unable to find two fingers I'd prefer to open this 'safe' with 100% accuracy. Not a comforting feeling. After using all 20 programs, I'm still trying to figure out how to let my wife program at least one of hers. We've tried having her program all 20 programs with her fingerprints and yielded similar results. The odds of it accepting the prints are still bad. It may be acceptable if your finger was wet, oily or dirty to get such inaccurate results, but a perfectly dry print yielding around 80% is completely unacceptable for immediate access if need be.Then came the fun part of filling in the 'safe' RS (storage cabinet). The advertisement photos are really misleading (false advertisement) in that they lead you to believe you can fit all the things they show in such a small space. The first issue was fitting the Full Width or 2/3rd Shelf and Pistol Racks inside the upper portion of the safe and fitting the AR Accessory Bundle on the door. When trying this configuration, the shelf sticks out enough to block the area where I would like the Spring Loaded Mount to go. In other words, it will not let you close the door if installed near the same level on the door as the Full Width or 2/3rd Shelf inside the cabinet.IMO there are other misleading photos regarding rifles being installed on the door. There always will be an extra step to getting a firearm ready for use as opposed to 'ready for use.' I'd prefer to have enough room on the door to have a rifle with optic/sights installed and erect and a magazine inserted. Sadly, there is not enough room for both. This will only work with flip up sights being down with a magazine installed and the rifle positioned all the way left on the door. Alternatively, the rifle can have sights/optic installed and erect with no magazine, but the rifle would have to be installed further right on the door panel which may lead to interference with the grip and the door closing. Utilizing the 'ROMEO 5' type optic, the grip touches/interferes with the door. The hope is that when I try to open the door in an emergency, there will be no interference with the grip (which there currently already is).All in all, I'm mostly happy with the product. I hope this constructive criticism is taken to heart. I also feel if all these issues weren't here, only then it might be worth the two thousand dollar price tag."

          "Contenu": "Like a lot of people (based on the website crashes to order the second round), I was thrilled to get ahold of a smart station for myself and a friend. My first one was a problem almost out of the box- would basically lock me out just looking at it despite saving 15 different versions of the same finger to unlock it. The keypad was unreliable, and the wireless charger was spotty. I sent it back and got a new unit. Now, the locking mechanism works but the safe has a habit of loudly beeping at us at 3 am every night Until we wake up. My friend reported that his unit barely opens on the initial release. He has to close and then re open for it to fully launch. The smart station is a great concept, but way too many bugs for me. This is supposed to be able to help quickly respond to a possible home emergency, and frankly seems to be fully capable of putting my family in danger more than helping. Vaultek support has been great, and I have appreciated their help but this product just is not ready for market."

The unit is also only thin metal and nothing more than the same thin metal as the cabinets in my garage. Anyone with lack of brains and a small crowbar or angle grinder would get into this so called \"safe\" very quickly without the code or fingerprint (biometric) scanner. This industry really need standardization in what companies are allowed to call a safe, and this is not it. My experience with this \"safe\" is I thought maybe because of a Black Friday deal I'd bite the expensive bullet and give a quick access \"safe\" a try. After opening the box, I'm sadly disappointed in realizing how poor quality this glorified storage cabinet is. Reading the instructions and programming the unit, I noticed more than half of the LEDs do not work. Once again, I was duped off of a Chinese made P.O.S... Now I am returning the unit and I don't even want a replacement, the lack of security and quality are really not worth the hefty price tag."

After sending a video of the safe doing this blinking and beeping thing I was informed by customer service that it was in access detection mode (or something like that) and was given instructions on how to take it out of that mode but it didn\u2019t work which they replied with they would give me a call, well several weeks later and still waiting for the call. There should be a way to factory reset the safe but I have yet to find it which is disappointing because I paid a lot of money for this safe that I guess I can still use the physical key to access but even then it will beep and blink when touched"

I was able to open the safe with the key no problems there. However when I put in the master code it I get a message \u201cunlock granted\u201d but then it reads \u201cstatus: locked.\u201d (This was after I put the battery in and plugged the unit in). Unplug the safe and removed battery same problem. Called NW Safes and their \u201ctech\u201d said to watch YouTube videos of how to program the safe. Okay\u2026. So to summarize I paid 1500 plus for a safe that I can only open up with a key (which I am now dubious if it will work correctly in the future given the problems with the electronics). Again to iterate, I opened the safe with the key, put the battery in, with the door open used the master code to change the passcode. It recognizes the  master passcode but the status still says locked and when I try to reset the passcode via vaulteks\u2019 prescribed method I get a Tamper Warning message. Oh and there is no way for me to contact somebody from Vaultek to resolve the issue. Save your money, time, and firearms and look to a more reputable safe maker."

Aesthetically appealing, great storage, great accessories, Biometrics are fine and the safe is secure enough for the PewPews. The Wi-FI\u2026the damn Wi-Fi. Connected just fine, no issues. Good for about a day. I bought a new router thinking that may be the problem, no luck. Ordered a new modem from Xfinity that arrived today, still no luck. I can connect to the safe just fine. The second the screen goes dark, Wi-Fi disconnects. I\u2019ve moved the router and modem closer. I\u2019ve moved the safe 3 times to avoid walls interfering with the signal with no joy. A little frustrating to say the least. For a $2,300+ safe, I expect the technology to work.

Not with the EDC tray. Don't put small items in the mesh pocket, unless you enjoy putting them back in after toting it around for 30 seconds. This design failure should be fixed by putting a zipper on it and making the EDC tray about 1/4\" less deep. Then you probably have a usable product that fetches 4 or 5 stars."

It's been a week since they replied and crickets!!   Updated 6/13/23:  Now that I've used this safe for around a month, I wanted to update.  I'm very disappointed!!  The fingerprint sensor SUCKS!  I would hate to think I had an intruder and need to rely on this.  I've set my finger print multiple multiple times (not a typo) and the best results I've had was being able to open it after 4 attempts! (and it's usually 8-10).  I use my fingerprint on an iPad and it works perfectly.  Now on to the wireless charging... I have an iPhone 13 Pro Max and it has to be just perfect in order to charge.  For a $500 safe... it should work much better!!The website, ease of purchase, and shipping updates were fantastic. For a suggestion... I would make the clock have an alarm clock feature and it's already Bluetooth, why not have a Bluetooth speaker built in!  Not only would it add functionality, but it would also disguise the unit better."

          "Contenu": "First of all, I have spent a ton of money with Vaultek over the last 30 days - an RS800, RS200, MX, and a Slider Series - including a few hundred dollars in extra accessories - a total of over $4500.  So I think I'm pretty qualified to have an opinion.  My Amazon experience was terrible - 2 of the 3 products showed up / 1 was a misshipment and took Amazon 40 days to resolve / refund.  When I ordered the RS800 there were FedEx issues (not Vaultek's issue) and their support wasn't extremely helpful in tracking it down.  Eventually it showed up.Bottom line - I think this is a good product and in some ways better than competing products.  But I have a list of constructive criticism / feedback that is impossible to share with Vaultek as they don't provide email contact addresses or ways to solicit feedback - other than this review.  I did not want to leave a 2 star review as I would have rather provided detailed feedback / suggestions in a more anonymous way.  Bottom line, their mobile app \"strategy\" is ridiculous as I have to have 3 different apps to manage / monitor 4 different safes.  The fingerprint readers are low quality / don't work very well, and many of the accessories don't work as well as designed.  The upside is I still think this is a better product than alot of what I've seen.  It seems very overpriced for a non-fireproof safe.  The tech is basic and seems non-upgradable.  I've got more comments but hopefully this gets someone's attention.  I would probably buy another RS800 but I just don't think it's worth what they are charging."

Okay, these things happen, the safe still seems secure enough to discourage casual thieves, and it's still easy access with the somewhat ridiculous mounting rig I had to set up - however, I asked a friend to try to get in - I didn't say to use a print or type a code... They touched the print scanner *accidentally* while touching buttons for the code and the safe slid open.  The reason I chose this model was that I (erroneously, naively perhaps) thought the print scanner was secure and I could get to the gun if I needed to while sitting in the car - I have a few other vaultek safes, and I turned on dual authentication immediately after seeing the safe just open for this random print.  Since it doesn't keep the gun secure to my satisfaction with only the print used to open it (because if you ever need to get it quickly you may not have the opportunity to blindly type a 6-8 digit code using only 5 different possible numbers)... I'm disappointed.  No more Vaultek products for me."

The safe is failing again and I am marking down my review from 5 stars to 1.  Customer service is responsive but they are not wanting to provide a permanent fix to my safe...only the cheapest way they can and kick the can down the road. They are sending another battery and charge cord.  Something is frying those but they really don't want to fix the safe properly.  At $1800 I cannot recommend the safe with all these problems. The safe has had an alarm go off in the middle of the night twice this week and several times since I bought it back in December.  I will update again once we see if the battery was the culprit all along or if they manage to time out my warranty with these ridiculous fixes.I bought the RS800i from Scheels in Colorado Springs.  It is perfect for what I need and I love the text updates when the safe is opened or moved as well as the biometrics.  I had an issue with low power mode toggling and sending multiple texts and setting off the alarm.  I contacted customer support and they always answered right away.  They diagnosed the power cable as the culprit (I leave it plugged in all the time) and they sent me a new one right away.  Put the new power cable on and it works perfect.  In this day and age, customer support is lacking with many companies.  Vaultek is on the ball and I highly recommend their products.  I also own a pistol box and love it as well."

I'm giving it two stars only because the technology is lacking for the price paid. What exactly is the point of Wifi? My other Vaultek safes using bluetooth allowed me to open the safe using the app. I cannot do this with the RS500i. Also why can I not set the light to stay on until either I close the safe or for more than like 20 seconds? And the notifications are crazy! I don't need a notification when \"I\" open or close the safe. How about a notification when a user other than the admin opens the safe? I know I opened the safe cause I just did it! Why can't we customize our alerts/notifications?  The app is preset taking away our choices.  And why doesn't the keypad and/or display light up when I come near it? I have to push a number button to get activity, then I get a tamper warning. These are all things you debated about in development meetings but chose to disregard. Amazingly, my complaints are along the same lines as others.  Anyway, this is a $1200 dollar safe but is not worth that price. Adding WiFi gives you the ability to charge more, but there was way more functionality using just bluetooth. Great, I can check my safe's status from afar but that's it.  Yeah, WiFi...woo hoo!!! And your video shows this awesome app on a desktop computer. Where is that? I can't find it in the app store? And i'm just guessing here, but I imagine there is no update ability on the safe even though there is WiFi? Just tossing that out there as a hmm???"

However, several issues make me regret buying them and will prevent me from buying any more or recommending the devices until upgrades are made and problems addressed.First, while the key fob and the push button devices work well, in our experience with both of these safes, the biometric sensors fail to recognize user fingerprints more than 75% of the time on the first attempt, despite calibrating and reprogramming the fingerprints numerous times. This is particularly problematic for the slider gun safe which is supposed to provide immediate access to the gun in a time of need. Second, despite configuring the devices multiple ways, the battery life for these units are horrible, even when we purchased the backup power packs and charged/used them according to the instructions. We have had the units just under a month and the power packs approximately 2 weeks and both units and battery packs have had to be charged twice because they went dead. All in all, I love the idea behind both of these devices, which is why we spent nearly $1000 on them in the last month; however, I would not recommend them to anyone, particularly at this price point, without the manufacturer addressing these issues because they defeat the purpose of having units you can quickly access if you can't get to the contents because the units are dead or they biometric sensors are not functioning properly."

          "Contenu": "Too many issues all around. I ordered the MX series safe with Wifi and overall am generally satisfied with the safe. My only issue comes from the alarm feature. It is too quiet to be an effective alarm. It can only be heard if you are in the same room withing a few feet and at that point you already know what it happening with the safe. Defeats the purpose. Similarly, other security features like the manual unlock alarm only alarms for about 20 seconds before being quiet again. Excellent. If I catch the event 20 seconds after it happened we're good. My main issues comes from the accessories. I bought the Bio-metric Smart Lock and the Battery Pack. Bio-metric Smart Lock:I'm not really sure what the deal is with this thing. I had no issues setting it up and it reads fingerprints decently well. Sometimes take an attempt or two that I accredit to poor programming on my part. However, I have it mounted so that I can always keep it plugged in. But when the battery is fully charged and plugged in, the scanner does not work. It will show a green success light that my fingerprint is approved but won't open the safe. Maybe one in every 20 scans will open the safe. As soon as I unplug it, it works 100% of the time. I guess you can't keep it plugged in like the manual suggests. The Battery Pack:Actual trash. Claims it will add 3-4 Months of battery to your safe depending on the safe. How about 2 weeks.I charged the unit 100% and charge my safe 100%. Plugged the battery into the safe and 2 weeks later get a notification that my safe has entered low battery mode (when it get's unplugged). Sure enough the battery pack is dead. Recharged and plugged back in, got about 8 days this time.Summary: As long as you don't buy the life-pod, the safes seems to be of great quality and function. The accessories are mere gimmicks at this point. Unless I got \"lucky\" and got 2 dud accessories at the same time."

          "Contenu": "When I first got my RS 500 I would have given it 41/2 stars but now only 2. What bothers me may not matter to others. I ordered my vault from a local shop where I could pick it up and save shipping and then ordered some accessories from Vaultek. One of the accessories was a 2-pistol rack and shelf bundle. Comes with two of the 2-pistol modules that you can also put AR mags in. When I got my vault and put in the modules that came with it along with my extra ones I thought it was good except for one thing. My pistols did not fit down in the module way I thought and were a little wobbly. I was a bit bothered by this but figured they would not fall out so ok. One day I was moving things around a bit and somehow accidentally discovered that there is a little plastic \u201cshelf\u201d in the bottom of the module and if you lift out the foam and remove that shelf the pistols slide down in that foam perfectly! Would have been nice to know. But leave that shelf in for the ar mags. If that was anywhere in the manual I missed it. Well fast forward and I needed more pistol storage so I went to the Vaultek site and now they have 3-pistol modules! Great. Got a couple. Now here is where Vaultek loses their stars. Got the new modules and was moving things around when I realized, for the first time, that the pegboard that you attach the modules to (the big selling point and whole purpose of this vault) does not go all the way to the bottom. Which would be no big deal except it\u2019s about 18\u201d short and plenty of space to put another module or two. This space then is basically worthless except where you have your rifles. If you only had rifles and a couple pistols above them you would never know. Well for me this was a huge bummer because I had a module I would have like to put there but no place for it. Well I figured there was an easy solution and that is the fact that the 2-pistol and 3-pistol (and new 4-ar mag module) are identical except for the foam insert. So I would contact Vaultek to get a couple 3-pistol foam inserts to replace a couple of my 2-pistol ones and I could get enough to mitigate the loss of that bottom 18\u201d. Customer service answered quickly to my inquiry about buying a couple foam inserts (don\u2019t need more modules!) and, of course, don\u2019t have them available. I know how manufacturers and suppliers work and Vaultek probably gets all this pre assembled from their supplier but they could easily order some separate foam inserts. But would rather sell you a $40 module than a $10 insert. And I didn\u2019t ask but I\u2019m pretty sure I could not get a longer pegboard which should already be in there."

Incredibly dangerous to have it unsecured if you have inquisitive kids as it's very unstable and can topple over very easily. You are almost forced to have to buy a separate base to prevent it from falling over.If you have baseboard molding, securing it to the wall it's tricky. Not to mention that the only way to secure it onto the wall requires unscrewing several sets of tiny fragile screws that strip very very easily. You can screw it into the floor but not ideal for many homeowners.2. Could use more lightning and have options for the lighting to remain on for much longer. The light stays on for an insanely short amount of time. I would still buy it again because it's just an excellent option for confined spaces and the technology is great and reliable."

Secondly the door doesn\u2019t slide all the way out when ejected and tracks on the sides  are pretty loose side to side lots of play when fully open, could be an issue longer down the line.

The configurable internal nature is pretty nice, but again, not enough for the price. I am disappointed that the low-power mode when on battery basically stops communicating after the battery alert. (Mine was on battery for a week and the data hadnt changed) Hopefully the safe will at least alert to tamper/opening on battery.Im also disappointed that I have to pay an extra few hundred to get better storage like the extra shelf, etc. - why am I getting the biggest safe to have one shelf?Having an app to see temp/humidity/tamper and opening details is great, and honestly the industry needs to catch up. Somehow Vaultek hasnt made this standard for all its devices including the insanely expensive Smart clock model - its as though they dont understand what sets them apart.If you need to know the status of your vault at all times and want pings on your phone, the Vaultek RS series for your rifle/shotgun is your only real option, but be prepared to spend."

          "Contenu": "Overall, I like the DS2i safe as it meets its primary design purpose in my eyes, which is to have a hidden (AKA disguised) safe which is also easily accessible and out in the open.  However, I am limited to what I can store in the safe, specifically the following common handguns do not allow the drawer to close: (a) 1911 with ambidextrous safety levers, (b) SIG P320 with a slightly flared (after-market) mag well (c), a .44 magnum revolver and (d) an 8-shot .357 magnum revolver.  If the safe was just 1/4\" greater in thickness, I feel all my handguns would be accommodated.  Additionally, almost any of my handguns, except for the likes of a SIG P365, will greatly slow the opening of the drawer such that it does not fully open.  Even with my SIG P365, the drawer just does not open fully or robustly.  My sincere message to Vaultek is for this safe to be redesigned like this: (1) increase the depth by at least 1/4\" and (2) use a more powerful drawer opening mechanism.  I recognize that new design/issued products often go through an evolution process based on real-world consumer feedback; I wish I had waited a few years to buy this safe."

It is a long safe and did have trouble making room on my night stand while also being able to read it, but I can't fault Vaultek as it does fit a 92FS and a mag with plenty of room. My biggest issue is the charging pad. It is a nice thought but there have been many times I have to re-center the phone because it will not charge or wake up to an almost dead phone. For almost $500 I would expect a better effort or to remove it completely. The nano was easy to set up and the biometrics and pin work fine."

It\u2019s sad that I had to buy this. They don\u2019t even include the battery.

          "Contenu": "Nice Safe. I got lucky and found one on the site. The DS2i arrived quickly and in good packaging.Pros: The safe looks great and is covert. The app lets you customize functionality i.e. fingerprints, volume and interior light. Has a charging pad for your phone, the door is spring-loaded and slides smoothly and the quality is good. The number pad only had four numbers on it and I believe that is good enough for quick access.Cons: The fingerprint sensor is like most sensors where you might need to try a couple of times for it to register your latent. Saving a few latent prints from each hand in case of emergency. The charger does not work well as it is difficult to get the phone centered on the charger.Overall: The safe is nice but not at $500 especially since the wireless phone charging pad doesn't work well. For quick access this safe is nice but I also bought it specifically because of the wireless phone charging feature built into the nightstand safe. I am thinking about returning it if Vaultek can't guarantee that they can fix the issue with my safe."

The safe is large enough to hold two pistols if desired or one pistol with extra clips and a box of ammo. Now the not so good. I paid extra for the biometric feature. I\u2019ve programmed it several times now. It recognizes my fingerprints immediately after it is programmed. However, if I wait a few hours or even the next day the unit will not recognize my fingerprint and I have to use the four digit code. I\u2019m on my fifth try but my guess is that as your hand expands and contracts with how warm your hand is, so does your fingerprint slightly enough to cause the unit not to function as it should. Secondly, if you have to get into the safe quickly that isn\u2019t possible either. If you depend on the biometrics in the middle of the night then have to switch to the four digit code that takes longer then you also have to use both hands to unlatch the security latches on either side which creates noise with the latches. Then you have to manually open the lid. It does not pop up on its own. Overall I think the safe is built well but just not as quick access as I would like as I wanted it to keep by my bedside in case of emergency with an intruder. Personally I would not purchase this item again or recommend it. The advertisement is deceiving on how easily the biometrics work and how easy access is."

However, the tray is absolutely useless if you have a mid-size or full-size firearm because the try will not fit or close when you put your firearm in the safe. Unless you have a thin and/or 1911 style firearm, don\u2019t bother getting the tray. The rest of the safe is of good quality, as well as the bag. Although when you put the safe in it, you\u2019re not gonna fit much of anything else in there. I\u2019m just very disappointed with the tray issue."

It's not a huge issue for me as I do not keep my weapon stored in the safe unless I am leaving it at home.

I let Morgan know again and he had a new unit with the corrects specs rushed out. New unit works great, looks good, and most importantly, keeps my firearm safely stashed, but accessible in the event of an emergency."

It also has a lot of rattle noise, which it won't have if mounted in a house/or office, but does when it's in a car. Vaultek doesn't include a security cable with the car mount bracket which is a huge miss. It can be removed from the car with a Philips screw driver so not real secure without a cable. Asked Vaultek about this but they were unwilling to provide the cable from the universal strap kit (which is another $35). The cable is probably $2. As usual with these setups, the fingerprint reader is hit or miss. Not sure I'd trust it in an emergency. Unfortunate that Vaultek can't sync the apps, so you have some of you wifi products in one app and any Bluetooth (like this one) on a separate app. Can't see them all in one."

It is the onoy quick access safe on the market that is reliable and have wifi features that work very well. There is only one complaint,  I wish there was a heavier duty version. I feel like I can open it with basic tools like a screwdriver. The safe attaches to base with 4 small hooks, I can probably use large screwdriver to pry safe from base. Reason for 4 stars, otherwise exceptional safe. Vaultek can keep the current version but have an option to purchase a more robust safe. I'd be willing to pay twice for a more solid safe, just to prevent theft of my firearm when I'm not home. For now when I'm out of town I take out firearm from slider and place it in my large safe."

One is the pre-perforated pluck foam makes it difficult to get a fit fine-tuned beyond the perforations (a good, functional fit can still be made).

The concept is great but it really needs to be a little deeper front to back considering it's advertised to fit a full-sized handgun with an optic (Red dot).  I use it for a full size Sig Sauer P320 but I had to change the grip module from a full size to a compact in order to clear the optic (sig sauer romeo 1 pro). Even with the compact grip mode it just barely clears when removing the gun.  Fortunately the Sig P320 series are modular but most customers won't have that option unless they have a Sig Sauer.  The cost is a bit high considering the overall size and gauge of steel they use as well.  I'd really like to buy their Smart Station but the cost for that is REALLY extreme for what it is and I have seen any discounts/sales etc even though I've already bought one of their products."

The reason for 4 stars has to do with the Wi-Fi setup.

The removable tray I find problematic as well, it does not fit with my pistol (glock 19). My last gripe is the battery. 9v are not a common battery around my house so it's annoying, I'd much prefer a rechargeable battery since it already has a charging port built in.

I'd recommend it to anyone in the market for something travel friendly and wanting to keep kids away from the firearm."

First and foremost, the charging port: vaultek didn't get the memo that micro USB is dead. It's time to move to USB C. Second, the internal light turns off pretty quickly after opening, even if the device is connected to power. It would be great if there was an option in the app to change the timeout, or keep the light on for as long as the box is open. Third, fingerprint management in the app could be better if you were allowed to delete individual prints and to reprogram them. If I have two people with access and then I want to remove one of them, it seems that I have to delete ALL of the prints and start over. Fourth, it would be nice if you could adjust how far the door opens, and if it would go further to allow comfortable access with vertical mounting on a wall. I'm looking forward to the next generation of this product, as well as others."

When the safe arrived, it already had the foam insert. That wasn\u2019t how it was listed on the site (I had to purchase to upgrade) but I was happy with it. So, I went through the return process (nice reps) which is easy enough; however the cost to ship the extra item back is more than 1/2 the price itself. Regardless I sent it back. Oh well. The site seems to be the issue (lack of detail on what\u2019s included resulting an an unnecessary purchase) and incorrectly listing out of stock items when inventory was existing. All system stuff that can be cleaned up. In the end, it\u2019s a great product and they have great reps working for them. I\u2019d recommend this VT10 to anyone."

More charging locations would be ideal instead of the one on the ONE side or have the charge port on the bottom and make it so the cord can go all directions, doesn't fit iwb or owb holsters unless you take out the foam   Yes, the charge light DRIVES ME CRAZY, although i did find a solution!!!! I used permanent marker to diffuse the NIGHT LIGHT.     So the makers don't realize this is going on the night stand by the bed?!?! 4.885 / 5 stars because of the charging indicator light and the price. I paid $450 and would have felt better at $300 or less. LOL great product though \ud83d\udc4c"

So I bought this so that in those rare cases I don't want the gun on me, I can be confident that it is secure if it gets taken. On the plus side, it was easy enough to set up, although it doesn't come with a 9v battery, and lets face it--who uses those anymore? So you probably won't have one lying around. It is well constructed and the locking mechanism works well. The big downside that I have with it is the room. Yes, it will hold a full sized firearm, which is great. However, if you have a gun in this thing, you can forget about using the tray, it simply isn't deep enough. So yeah, that is a big downer for me, because it limits the amount of things you can carry. So it may not be a five star for me, but you may not care a bit. I did buy the lid ordanizer--extra cost, so that helps a little bit."

Last and most importantly make sure to pay close attention to the clearance. I have a magwell on the base of my gun and when I put that gun in the safe it rubbed against the top of the safe and the safe would not open at all, so I had to keep a different gun in the safe. The height of my magwell is 1 3/4 inches."

And I took it trough security at Atlanta airport and I thought this case would held up rough handling, but I was surprised to se see a scratch on the top as it came out from the security filters. So I don\u2019t know if I would throw it like they do on the advertisement video. I don\u2019t want to ruin my 700 box, so in that aspect I would give a bad score. For all other aspects I love my case. Is so fancy. Everyone at my gun range just went dropping jaws all the way. I bought extra accessories and I really love that I can arrange things how ever I need to. For example if going to the range or just to keep my guns safe at home. So I don\u2019t know if it will resist a fall and I defenetly won\u2019t try to see if it handles ok and won\u2019t brake.  Also I think the pressure latches fills a little weak (cheap material). Maybe I am wrong but time will tell. It\u2019s my first vaultek product and so far I am very happy with my life pod xt.

Recently, it developed an issue (WiFi drops and screen blinking), and I reached out to their support team and got a prompt response. It was determined that I needed a new internal backup battery, which they promptly mailed to me for free. The new battery fixed my issues, and I\u2019m back to having a solid, reliable gun safe. It\u2019s good to know that companies like Vaultek still know the art of customer service. Thanks Vaultek!"

          "Contenu": "I bought this second Vaultek Lifepod for travel after trying my wife\u2019s \u201cRose Sig Sauer P365\u201d edition Vaultek Lifepod.  Simple, relatively light (about 2 pounds), and pretty easy to program and operate.  There is a key backup.  United Airlines gave me a hard time when I last traveled with a padlocked plastic case which the gate agent pried open and poked his little finger in telling me I needed to find a better locked box - the Lifepod can\u2019t be easily pried open and is TSA compliant.  It fits my Glock 43X MOS pistol with Holosun sight mounted and an extra magazine.  I would recommend this safe to any of my friends that carry compact firearms concealed and are looking for a travel safe for their luggage or car and also as a safe that easily fits in a nightstand drawer.  I chose orange because it definitely stands out in a suitcase full of stuff."

          "Contenu": "At first I was cautious at pulling the trigger on this safe because of the price as it was my first hand gun safe so I only had online pictures and reviews to go by. I am so glad I went for it! When it arrived I immediately felt reassured of the quality just by the weight of the box. The packaging was well done protecting the contents from any shipping damage that could have been done. The safe is truly a work of art and craftmanship. From the elegant, useful front display, to the top mounted fingerprint reader and 4 digit code input pad and wireless charging pad (for phones and smart watches), to the USB charging port on the rear, a lot of thought was put into this safe other than just storing your firearm safely and other important items. The steel construction is solid and sturdy. The user manuals are informative and very thorough. Upon unlocking the safe the drawer slides out quickly and smoothly. The padded interior provides protection for your gun and any valuables. The interior light is just bright enough to do the job. Pushing the drawer back in gives a nice satisfying locking click telling you that everything is secure. Mine is holding a fully loaded 1911 with a loaded spare mag and my EDC knife - a decent amount of weight - yet the drawer still operates like butter. The finger print reader works 99% of the time for me first time. I've gotten to know the exact angle to come down on the reader where it works best. My 4 digit code always works no matter how fast I press it. I also purchased the desktop locking surface mount which I will be installing along with the cable lock as well. I will defiantly be buying a second one to house my S&W .40 plus mags. The clock and phone charger will be a nice addition to my night stand!"

Support provided the info I requested promptly. The order process was straightforward and easy. Shipment came when promised. When my Lifepod XR Range Edition arrived, I couldn't have been happier with my purchase. The safe was easy to setup and program. The XR has a very functional design and perfect for my needs (ordered extra XT/XR pistol rack to swap out the provided mag rack to carry an extra pistol when needed). Along with the safe, I bought a spare security cable for my car and use this to secure the Lifepod XR every time I travel to the range. The provided security cable is used within the house. Overall, a great ordering experience and outstanding product. This is my second Lifepod (Lifepod 2.0) and my wife has a Lifepod 1.0 on the way. I would recommend these products highly."

Thank you for being so kind, nonjudgmental thanks for helping me get through this stressful situation, happy shooting, pew, pew."
