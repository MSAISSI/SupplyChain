They want me to call my credit card company every month and have the charges reverses.  The credit card company says they can't block the double billing from occurring but they have now reported it to their fraud unit.  Can you imagine!  A company knowingly double billing all it's Customers and doing nothing to stop it."

They even went as far as saying that this is a busy time so pretty well figure it out yourself.  I'm absolutely flabbergasted in the incredibily bad service.  I have never expereinced this in my lifetime."

I bought 2 fonus sim cards and when we were about to travel to the US I tried to activate but their activation server was down.  It took them 2 days of me chatting with them before an agent even admitted to me that the activation server was down.  So not really sure how good the service is but do know you can't rely on them.  Thank god for T-mobile and if you are in Canada Public mobile now has a plan $40 for 40 gigs that works in both Canada and the USA but with a real phone number not a voip one.I should also mention a bunch of other people also stated the activation servers were down and I have to wonder if they were able to remove those reviews as well."

I sent multiple requests to active my sim and have ticket numbers associated with my request. My sim was never activated upon my request and they never resolved my ticket. This company is a scam, after reaching out to them many times with proof of my conversations they never delivered their promises. You are much better off paying for a service that delivers on their promises and service. Would not recommend throwing their money away on fonus to anyone.Please feel free to reach out for any documentation you require."

Unfortunately I couldn't hear the website name it was garbled.  Followed the instructions on my phone to reset the apn and that didn't work.  Emailed them and got the same reply about agents being busy and to try again later.  I'm having no trouble with the mobile data, just the phone. At this point I'd like to cancel but can't figure out how to do that either.  My opinion of fonus is that when it works it's great but I sure wouldn't do it again."

This is not the first time they are having internal issues. I asked what the issue is and was told because it\u2019s a new payment system.  Well that\u2019s a standard response these days.As her service was down I sought compensation for the outage period and got the perfect response \u201cWe can\u2019t do that because We are a prepaid company \u201c.  Huh? You take my money on a monthly basis but can\u2019t make an adjustment in my favour because you have internal problems?What kind of logic is that Fonus?What kind of squirrels are running the company?"

They include a statistic in the email about using more than 99.5% of other users, a stat which they control since they can cancel at any time. This would suggest they only keep clients who use less than 40 GB per month. I hope they're smart enough to not charge me again (others claim to have this experience). I've also seen them respond to other peoples posts and publicly reveal details about their account (such as usage details). It seems they're looking for people who want unlimited but won't use it. If you plan to stream, you'll need to monitor your usage.  Depending on your video quality you'll get 5-10 hours per week of streamed content before they give you the chop."

(2) You have to use Fonus App to do everything, the problem is that the app offered by Fonus is realy bad, for instance, it cannot pass from wifi to wireless automatically, you will have to do this manually. and each time you do this, if you are on the phone, the line will cut !!! the service always cut for may other unclear reasons. Furthermore, It does not work well with other technology like Bluetooth, Microsoft Your Phone, etc. The contact list is hard to use on the Fonus App, it's even hard to hang after you make a call (the screen often disappears and it's impossible to get it back). If you use this service, be prepared to restart your phone 3-4 times per day and miss at least 30% of your call. I wanted to encourage a new business, but I do not recommend."

          "Contenu": "Sadly 99% of the time customer service has a glib answer that does not resolve the issue. Case in point, porting phone numbers. Two of my phones were released from the original carrier on a Wednesday, a week later after hounding customer service it was finally resolved. Another was instead of sending a call to one telephone they set it up so that the same number was put on 2 different phones. My wife\u2019s telephone number was effectively placed in limbo so she couldn\u2019t receive calls from the hospital about her ailing mother.On another note I\u2019m still trying to understand how they can only supply under 8mpps download speeds with AT&T in Texas. I\u2019m not in the hinterlands I\u2019m in an area of the Rio Grande Valley  Surely it is populaces enough to offer more than that?It has been slow and difficult to get resolution from them. Just setting up my phone and my wife\u2019s took more than 20 hours of online dilly dallying. That\u2019s unacceptable.  Guess I\u2019m the dummy for hoping that this company might be offering a reasonable service at a very competitive price, but unfortunately they fail when it comes to service and supportToo bad really.I will add to this that the one bright exception to the above is Bruce in Customer service who never fails to provide unwavering support with the challenges of getting the phones (2) to work. He is thoughtful and knows his stuff. Hope Fonus can clone him soon   He is their saving grace."

This \"company\" sells SIM cards but resells a service provided by AT&T, but in terms of Costumer Service you are better treated if you deal with an actual professional support team, and Fonus does not provide but misleading excuses, then cancels you as a client, but keeps your money, since they don't refund for a service that was not used.Trailblazer Mr. Simon Tian.

I was able to make one outgoing call from Mexico and received another from Canada but beyond that it wouldn't allow me to make or receive calls, they would not even dial out.  Customer service was less than helpful as they would each tell me to restart the phone or reboot the app, then got very snarky and argumentative when I asked to cancel.  I simply asked to cancel because it didn't work for me, I didn't ask for a refund, they replied that they would not provide a refund, although offering to provide some sort of refund or forward moving solution would of made sense, I got more of a snarky response about how it works for others and that no refund would be provided.Despite their reply, multiple force stops, reboots and reinstall of the fonus app did not work, and their responses when I asked to cancel were extremely snarky and passive aggressive. Was going to return if they fixed their issues, but definitely not with their level of customer service.I've also read their great reviews and highly suspect the way they are written is from their own employees, mainly Bruce who in reality was a very passive aggressive person and belongs nowhere near any sort of customer service department.Another further update is that if you wonder how they get all the great reviews on Facebook, they delete all critical comments then block them from commenting, even if constructive on how to improve their service,  very shady company!"

Wait another 24 hours then try again. Seriously, what kind of a telecom company takes 4 days to activate a sim. Im at the point of trying to do a chargeback on the company.* response to Fonus's reply: the reason i bought the sim is to try put what your company has to offer. That intention is still there.

Despite my city being covered by Fonus's networkThe really frustrating part was trying to leave. Fonus goes through a third-party for their VOIP phone plans. And when I tried to leave Fonus, and wanted to port my number out (something that takes about 1 day normally)...it ended up taking 3 weeks and lots of phone calls to their third-party provider (and to make things even worse, they had sold my number to another sub-contractor, who stalled on releasing my number). *Edit: in response to Fonus's reply below, I am adding the following detail: My number was not sold to their VOIP provider (IRISTEL) which is who I had to deal with for porting it out; in fact, IRISTEL was surprised to note that the number had been sold to ANOTHER third-party. Also, I repeatedly sent the SAME information in my request to port and eventually it was accepted - the initial claim on their part that the address didn't match was never substantiated. All of this was NOT worth the meagre savings. Especially since I ended up paying for an extra month while dealing with them dragging their feet when I tried to leave."

Here is why in no specific order.1st) Very unstable connection for mobile reception, I have missed numerous calls due to this problem. It appears you need to delete the Cache often to keep your device connected for voice calls.2nd) 2FA (Two Factor Authentication) = because Fonus is VOIP many if not all 2FA will not work with this system. This includes Online Banking, Brokerage firms, and many more. There are workarounds for some but not all. So Be Aware.3rd) Double Billing and extreme challenges changing your current billing, yes they will double bill you, you need to check your payment method frequently. Also if you need to change your payment method you basically need to start again, cancel your account and SIM then input the new billing information, very challenging.On the positive side, the Data is a good and very reasonable price. In the USA you get access to 5G so that would be a positive, but not available in Canada. Also, their customer service is very good, attentive, and helpful, however during an online help session the agent told me to \"search the internet for a solution\" for my issue. I did and found the solution, \"Cancel my account\".Not to say I would not come back to Fonus if they can improve the issues noted, but as of today, I am moving on to Shaw Mobile. Yes, I have heard the problems they have so you may hear more from me soon."

It took a few days to resolve the issue which effected our ability to communicate with family back home.  A second event was more problematic when Fonus changed its system back in July/Aug. & sent an e-mail to an address I don't use.  When I missed the deadline to switch over I found out my texts on Aug. 21st were not being received which caused some issues as I was having a known medical condition resurface & this caused others to worry needlessly because my text messages didn't go through in a timely manner.  Why didn't Fonus send me some type on warning through the cell phone system. The matter was eventually resolved but did require a lot of communication via e-mail with Fonus to set up this new plan & having the ability to function within the system again.  On the positive side, I made a couple of short telephone calls that worked much better than the past when calls were disconnected after several minutes & the lines were iffy at best.  Communication over e-mail is OK on straight forward issues but live over the phone discussions are required on more complex ones which Fonus seems to make almost impossible to have & led my wife to change service providers.  I have remained for the time because I use the Fonus system for mainly text messages at this point."

Got those issues resolved quicker and less stress with each one as I learned how deal with it.Each time there has been problems, I have been assured quick resolutions which have never been the case.The only things which keep us from dropping Fonus like a brick are the vast quantity of data and the option to switch to any of the Canadian service providers on demand. If I travelled to the U.S. regularly, I'd add the no roaming fees and activations to that list. All in all, I have a love/hate for this company with hopes that they smooth out all their issues and become the benchmark for mobile service. On the other hand, perhaps another startup company will come out of the gate strong and compete directly with Fonus."

Then they charge a separate charge of $1.00 USD ($1.29 CDN), which they now tell via their online chat, is an authorization charge, it will be credited back at some time. Now I am complaining about the exchange fees mostly, I am not certain if this is them or my bank, but the 1.29 rate for USD>CDN is very dear.

I had cancelled the service as well 2 weeks prior to the changes not realizing they were going to happen.Two of my friends who stuck with them advised me that after the changes Fonus was now reliable!  Not dropping any calls and the voice quality of the phone calls was now great.As I am going to do a lot of traveling around the world I decided to give them a second chance and a signed up with them again.  WOW what a difference.  The app is 100 percent better and the call quality is great.  No dropped calls. Now I can roam in 55 Countries and call 85 without paying anything extra! The only issued I have run into so far is that they advertise 5g service where available.  Well I live in Winnipeg where it is available and my phone is 5g capable.  I can not get any 5g signals from any of the companies that Fonus uses here.  Having said that the 4 g download/upload speeds are decent 83 down and 5.3 up.

          "Contenu": "The fonus offering is unheard of in Canada - a north american unlimited plan with a local number provided. However, what I hadn't realized is that they give you unlimited data and from that you use it to call and text from a fonus app - not from your native phone software. I thought that app was optional somehow.Every aspect of setting this up was untenable, other than the customer service. I couldn't get the sim because I was in some UI infinite loop on their site. I had to order it through Amazon. Activating the sim caused some mysterious 404 error where I was an unknown user for some API of an american voip service. I had to use a different email and my incognito tab. Now I have two separate accounts, but the new one has a email provided password I can't reset because of some unexplained 401 error, given I can use the password to log in. So I'm stuck with the security compromise of having this unencrypted password in my email. Another email told me to put the wrong name into the APN. It was not clear from the email or anywhere that I'd be dependent on this Fonus app. It took me over an hour to set this up today. If they didn't have rapid response chat help I wouldn't have made it through. I kind of resent I did. The deal was too good to pass up. Now I'm just waiting for my number to port over and I'm hoping that's the last I have to do of setup; that I can just coast on some good savings now.Update - ah, my password did update to the new one, even thought it said otherwise. Ok, less concerned about security of my payment method now...I have a feeling that over time as I travel more I'll be really happy I chose this."

          "Contenu": "Fonus had some growing pains, as it originally promised unlimted everything, everywhere, with roaming around the world.It may have launched a bit too soon in November 2019 which has left quite a few of the early adopters very disgruntled as they didn't get what they hoped for right away.   Covid-19 played a part in the delays as most SIM cards were shipped from China, and did not get delivered until Apr-June 2020.   Some roaming agreements may have fell through, as once SIM cards starting getting activated, service is only available in the US/Canada/Mexico.   Simon, the CEO, is on track to have worldwide roaming in place with a future update.Nonetheless, in Canada the Fonus SIM is fantastic.  It roams on all 3.5 of the major carriers (Bell, Telus, Rogers, and Freedom Mobile) with LTE speeds.  It will automatically select the network that has the strongest signal and adapt as needed.   In Toronto, I've reached 300Mbit speeds with Telus.There will be future updates such as a VoIP app as a way to have a Canadian number and the ability to port numbers to it.  Currently, you can only get a US number, and there is no ability to port non-US numbers.   This will change to a data-only SIM, with the VoIP app.   In addition, future roaming agreements are supposedly coming to allow for extended roaming in more countries.In Canada at least, the value is there as a $30 USD/month plan with unlimited data on all 3.5 carriers is tremendous value.   Right now, it might be best suited in dual-SIM phones though due to not being able to port over your Canadian number.If you need lots of data, there is good value in the service, and eventually the future updates will make it something very unique in the Canadian market."

Personally, I'm way more interested in data and texts and can readily call using another data based app if I have to, like Messenger, WhatsApp...there are other options, but calls do typically work fine.

Leave it to him and he will track down the billing information.

I have looked into several articles about Fonus and read through lots of reviews before I decided to use this service. I purchased a SIM card and it was delivered to me in only 2 days. I installed the card and by following the instructions, I was able to activate my SIM card and select a new number of my preference. Since I started using Fonus, I had no problem and I am totally satisfied with its service. I am saving over $20USD by paying only $30USD for Fonus compared to AT&T and with better service!"

Next favorable impression was when I needed customer service to activate my SIM card after running into issues, and with the rapid and friendly assistance from Bruce, I was quickly up and running!I think the only thing to consider is that with this service you essentially get a generous data plan, but not actual calling or texting - You must use the associated Fonus app to actually emulate the calling and texting features. If you can live with this, the service is an unbelievable value!"
