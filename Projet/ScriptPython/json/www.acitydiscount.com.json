          "Contenu": "My Company, P Point Market has purchased kitchen equipment from A City Discount (03/25/2019)The store instead of placing a balance back in our credit card, placed a IS Credit ($3,798.00).When the issue was found, I contacted ACity to get the balance back into my account.  A City Discount said that because it is an old account they can't do the reimbursement.  We think this is an abuse and at least they could give us an opportunity to get some merchandise. Very bad for this company.  Please advise how to handle this type of abuse"

You would think that a $50.00 dispute would have been resolved in a more timely manner but it took over a month. I ordered a lift gate for delivery, but the driver didn't use it. I have video and pictures documented and sent to ACityDiscount. However, ACityDiscount said the driver was disputing my word so they would not give me the refund, without more investigation. It wasn't until started calling twice a week did I get to speak to a manager, Summer. She was extremely rude and curt. Larry and Brian were always very pleasant when I talked with them, (many times I might add) but they were unable to resolve the issue without me going over their heads. A little kindness goes a long way. Unfortunately Summer will have me looking elsewhere in the future."

They left an answer saying they provide 5star service but as everyone can see that is just not so.  Not even the decency to call and let a person know what is going on, what they are doing to correct the problem or at least just to let me know they answer their phone msgs!  Guess I have to send this complaint to the BBB and Consumer Protection Agency for their review of this problem.

True only covers their compressors for 5 years and will not cover it because the unit is 12 years old. When delivered there was a USED sticker on the freezer and they still claimed it was new.  These folks are crooks.  There service manager is arrogant and rude and claims the unit was never even turned on and checked yet they still would not fix the compressor.   By the way....The Better Business Bureau has 11 complaints logged against this business!!!  Live & Learn.  Your reply below is a lie.  The unit was manufactured in 2005 according to True who said they would have honored the warranty on the compressor.  True stated you cannot sell a piece of their equipment that was manufactured 12 years prior as new, but you did.  Never been used huh, I guess that's why you guys slapped a USED sticker on the unit.  Regardless of your warranty True would have honored the compressor warranty so your argument is moot, and a lie.  You people are crooks!"

I emailed Justin who I purchased it through and received no response. After a couple of weeks, Mike emailed me back saying that I only ordered one bracket and any others would have to be purchased. I asked follow-up questions, again thinking there should be two arms and received no response. I sent two more follow up emails with no response to Mike. I emailed the customer service email describing the service I received, funny enough it went to Mike. He did email me back, saying he did not see any order I have ever placed, nor does he have an account with my name on it. I have spent over $10,000 at ACD in the past year. I responded again with all of my information and have yet to received a response back, this was 5 days ago.Some of the salesmen may be great, but if they have to answer to this guy for any issues that come up I can promise you that you will not be taken care of as a customer. There are other options out there that want your business."

Now it is time to use the warranty and I find out from the company there never was a warranty attached with these units!  ACity had even listed these units touting the company's warranty as 'the best in the business with 3 years bumper to bumper'.  They NEVER indicated these were being sold without a warranty.  Even my invoice states these items as being 'NEW' not used or discontinued models.  My disgust with Acity stems from their REFUSAL to call me back or put someone on the line when I call who can help!  They will not even be respectful enough to return a phone call.  Coldtech execs were very upset to hear of these practices and have since contacted Acity.  I am sure this feedback will do little to make them call or uphold the warranty they advocated with the units.  I hate to go to the Consumer Protection Agency and BBB but maybe that is my only course of action here as everyone at ACity is in hiding.  Seems everyone has had a great experience with ACity, lets see if they change my mind a re-write a new feedbackOne Very upset customer.  Do not like being misled and then left holding the bag!"

Didn't work at all when finally plugged in (mid November)  I did call \"A City Discount\" and left a message.  No reply.  Spent $894.29 on refrigeration repair (just got the bill now, hence the review).  It was made operational, but leaking water into freezer compartment.  Then this week, the kitchen filled with a burnt electric smell and it went dead again.  Parts are on now on order. I had ordered equipment from them before, so, as a return customer, was hoping to at least get a return call.  No such luck.  My advice: don't go for their used equipment. My repairman says that the unit clearly had been worked on before as it had cheap replacement parts (which were the latest parts to fail).  I should have bought new, but I was caught needing to meet a health inspector's demands at a time where funds were short.  Now I'm out $2,900 and waiting on the next bill-- and I'll still have the leak in the freezer compartment to deal with... and I'm pretty sure I'll continue having issues.For $3,800 I could have bought a True T-49F new with 3 years warranty on parts and labor, 5 years on the compressor.Don't throw your hard-earned money away on folks who won't even return your call.  You will regret it, like I am right now."

I called ahead and asked if they had continuous feed food processors in the showroom on display and the girl on the phone asked which brands and I told her and she said yes. So I drove 30 minutes to get there. When I walked in no one asked to help me so I asked where they would be. When I went to look there were none on display. On 2 brands in boxes, not on display and not one of the brand that I asked about. So I went back to the counter a 2nd time and had to interrupt a conversation between 2 employees to ask if there were any out in the store somewhere. The answer was no. So I went back to the shelf looking for the brand that I was interested in and could not see it. I looked on line and it said it was in stock (which I checked before driving so far).  So I went back to the counter a 3rd time and once again had to stop their conversation (between 2 employees) and ask if someone could help me. The girl asked what I needed, so I proceeded to ask about the appliance. She did not know what I was talking about so I showed her on my phone and that it was in stock but I could not see it anywhere. She looked it up and said it was online only. I asked her why it said \"in stock\" , she had no answer. And STILL no offered to go back to the shelf with me and take a look. I told her that I called before I came and drove 30 minutes to look at a product that was supposedly in stock. I was exasperated at the level of customer service and knowledge of their products. I just walked out. Don't expect any sort of help if you go to this store.Update after response 12/2/21I did not ask for a specific model. I wanted to see the brand which was not on the shelf and showed as \"In stock\" on your website, which I was told was not kept in the store and online only.  If it is not in the store it should not say \"In stock\". Its as simple as that."

The sales staff do not have the required knowledge to help in markets across the country. I am in MN and my salesman sold me a hood that is illegal here. I would suggest using a local company, as they know the local codes, even if it costs a little more. The consumer should not be required to read all codes and know them. If there is a so called sales specialist, it should be their job to know the requirements.\r My other annoyance has to do with payment. If you are custom ordering something or getting custom pricing, then this is not the place for you. My salesman would email estimates, I would confirm the desire to order, then wouldn't hear anything! I guess it is my job to track down the salesman to buy something? Last I checked, when someone wants to give you money, you should be seeking them out. I felt like I was working to place my order, not acting as the consumer. Everything that is custom has to be ordered by phone, so this is where my issue was. I guess the entire process was just far too difficult. To really put the icing on the cake, my salesman would very rarely call me, or return a call. If I didn't call him, then nothing would happen. Even then, nothing happened. I would ask questions, but never get any actual feedback. Just frustrated I guess! \r Stick to the standard stuff and you'll be just fine! Also, know what you are ordering, because the sales staff doesn't!"

          "Contenu": "It would be great if the photos of the item were the actual photos or the description were not so generic.  Only two baskets came versus the four it shows in the picture.  We were lucky we had one more basket to mostly fit in there on hand.  We were also lucky to have had dividers from our previous ice cream freezer or we would have had a big mess of novelty ice cream products just heaped together in the baskets.  These freezers should come with the parts needed to display ice cream neatly.  My previous freezer had four baskets with each divided into 3 compartments with extra storage below.  I'm now down to three baskets with reclaimed dividers and no room for a 4th basket and no storage space there to fill.  This cuts down on my organization and ability to carry the same product.  The old dead freezer and the new freezer have the same dimensions.  The sale went well, the freezer was delivered right on time, and it seems to be working well, so far."

We followed the tracking directions - called the number provided - and got a rep who was clueless. We gave her all the relevant information and she said the order did not exist. Yet we had been told it had been shipped and we should call this number. After more than one call with both my husband and I talking to the UPS person she finally realized that we had been given the wrong number. The number we needed was UPS Freight. The ship was promised for 2 different times, then delayed. The trucker who finally delivered the steel table and sink was very good to deal with, fortunately, after the previous aggravation. He offered to open the box when I said I wanted to inspect the merchandise and waited patiently while I looked it over to be sure there was no visible damage and that a table, 4 legs, sink, and faucets were included. I highly recommend you contact UPS and be sure reps know that to immediately put the customer in contact with UPS Freight rather than regular UPS if it is a large package. Better yet, have that information included in emails from ACity Discount. The frustration we experienced could have been completely avoided with better communication."

Bad thing is, the other unit I bought from them (same manufacturer) now went down. Must be something about getting close to end of warranty. They said it should be no problem reimbursing me this time as they straightened things out with the manufacturer. I would have gone to 5 stars but with all the initial problems, no call backs etc I went with 4 due to their fighting for me with the manufacturer.  I'd buy from them again but will ask more questions also. Just good business practices."

Had I known, I could've pass that info along to my client who was nervous about not having his item on time.  I also spent some time looking for an alternative.  I think the freight company you hired could have done a better job.  I thought of letting you know to see if you'll pass my message along to them.  Maybe they need some feedback.  Thank you!"

          "Contenu": "Third appliance purchased from ACityDiscount and everything has been 5 star worthy until this last delivery (first time fedex was the carrier). I had requested a call be made before delivery and provided a cell phone plus backup landline. After never getting a call on either and seeing the status change from delivery on Thursday to pending, I decided to call fedex. After a 20 minutes of transferring to different departments I was told that someone did call and when I disputed this was promptly hung up on. I went and got phone records from my cell provider after this, and those proved to me there never was a call. Back to calling fedex and twenty more minutes of shuffling around and I get a supervisor and the best they can do is 5 days later even though the shipping center where the item is is within 15 miles of the destination. The shipping portion of this particular order was incredibly frustrating, and completely unlike the previous orders from AcityDiscount.com. Removing fedex from the equation would bring this rating back up to 5 stars"
