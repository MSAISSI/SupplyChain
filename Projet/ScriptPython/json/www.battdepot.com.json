After I had a total failure of the battery I took the battery apart and surprisingly it was not the cells, but the chip inside the battery that had failed.  This stuff is just garbage. Read the warranty. they warranty everything except for the function of a battery.  They did respond to this review, which I was surprised with. And I did send back the battery. Getting emails response from them is brutal.  They never sent me new battery using the excuse they took the battery apart, but I told them that before I sent it in and they send me the return info so that was not an issue at that time. Best thing is to move on from this company and the companies that are subsidiaries.  Do a Google on these guys it is a disaster. Even BBB has a bad rating on these guys."

Longitevity is great, but it cannot handle a resume and subsequently shuts down within a few seconds.  Windows reports an unexpected shutdown and you have to plug back into the PSU (even with sufficient power) to restart at which point its fine again until the next sleep cycle.Will be starting the RMA process as I am now beyond the Return timeframe.  Have ordered an original Dell battery for a few pounds more and the issue has goneFundamentally, I feel ripped off.  Let's see how the RMA process goes and will be end up stuck with a replacement battery I will not be using so will not be using this company again, nor will I recommend.

Finally after some back and forth I was offered to send the battery for a replacement or refund. I chose the refund option as I noticed that the previous battery in my laptop was the same exact battery which only lasted me 7 months. This battery was replaced by a store and they ordered their battery through battdepot.com. I sent the battery back for a full refund, and I was promised a full refund with the shipping I paid. The refund I received was without the shipping. Now, I can't even get a hold of them, and when I chat with customer service, they keep saying that they will look into it and get back to me on it."

Definitely not worth buying from this company.EDIT: Was asked to return via cheapest return postage, but based on other reviews I chose a signed for postage as i didnt trust them. This still cost less than what battdepot charged for sending the faulty battery to me in the first place.  I also emailed battdepot before posting the battery to ask if they would refund return postage and was told that they didn't. By law they are required to pay for return postage for faulty goods."

The battery has low quality of use. After 6 months of use, the battery I ordered from battdepot has already reached its end of life. Upon reaching 20% of charge, my laptop shuts down. Also, it is hard to charge the battery to 100% since it stops around 90%. Despite being cheap at a quarter of standard price, the battery does not meet my expectations. My old battery had a life of 3.5 years, 7 times longer than this battery."

They replied within a few hours to give advice on what to try when installing. After following the installation instructions everything started working perfectly, however computer shut down again the next day in the middle of some work which I subsequently lost.  I would therefore be very cautious about replacing a battery again from anyone. I can no longer recommend this battery as it is unreliable and I have had to replace it with my old battery."

On reading other reviews, I see that others have had no luck getting a response or a refund, so I am not even going to waste my time trying. I realise now that I should have verified before I bought whether or not there was a registered address or contact telephone number for the company. My advice would be, don't use them, unless they are willing to publicise their company address and provide a contact number."

Holes were 1-2mm out of position across the width and length. With a bt of stretching / persuation I managed to get it installed.Then my mouse buttons did not work, which was because it was a little too thick and impinged on the plate. I managed to solve this by adding a bit of paper packing either side of the mouse plate.So it is installed and all working, but your average joe would have been stumped by this. The quality control of the Chinese manufacturers needs to improve."

Installation - no problem.Carried out 4 full charge/full discharge cycles as per instructions. Used the in-built Dell battery meter for measuring charge level.During these preliminary cycles, typical \u2018battery-only\u2019 operation of the laptop was used to carry out the discharge procedure. On each occasion It was noted that the battery charge level decreased steadily to around 60% after 1 hour. At this point, the computer shutdown without warning. On restarting using external power, the battery charge was seen to be practically zero. This \u2018cliff-edge\u2019 performance drop-off characteristic has been displayed repeatedly now since purchase with no signs of improvement.However, it must be said that the battery appears to hold its fully charged condition for several days if the laptop is left shutdown, disconnected from external power and unused."

I had to return both batteries and they did refund me, but they did not notify me that the batteries had been received or that they would refund me. I had to check my account for that. However, my issue is that I discovered a defect in both batteries which I pointed out to them in great detail in several emails but they STUBBORNLY REFUSED to respond or acknowledge my comments. I was staggered by this and very irritated. How could they be so ill-mannered and dismissive of me when I was making a very valid point several times over???

          "Contenu": "I bought a replacement battery for my laptop (November 2018) and only 8 months later am receiving a message to say 'consider replacing your battery'.  After 1 hour 50 minutes of use, the battery drops to 50% and then almost immediately reaches critical point.  On contacting Battdepot, I was told that if a battery lasts more than two hours after 8 months use, it is not deemed faulty however (as I have attempted on several occasions to convey)  the battery is not lasting even two hours and therefore, I believe, is at fault especially when taking the aforementioned message into account.Battdepot have been totally intransigent when discussing this issue with me and have referred me to their T&C's rather than concede that the battery is not fit for purpose.  Perhaps they should add in a section to their small print that says 'as soon as a battery leaves our warehouse and we have received your money, you are on your own even if you have very good grounds for concern, we won't assist you.  Please note that our batteries are of poor quality so best of luck'.  I would avoid using this seller."

I followed it's journey on the tracker and it travelled from the UK to several places in the UK then to Germany and France before returning to the originating location in the UK.  Easter intervened and I finally got the item delivered to Dublin, Ireland a week later than it had originally been notified for delivery. It arrived within the 3-6 working days stated on the website but as I had been notified of a delivery date and stayed in to receive it I was disappointed that due to Easter and the non working days associated it took an extra week for the delivery.   Had I not been advised of the original delivery date and only the one on which it actually arrived I would have given a better rating.  Poor communication and sending the parcel east instead of West contributed to this."

It does seem to be working properly without overheating and works better than the others I had tried.  I've only used it for about half a day and hopefully there will be no problems.  I will upgrade this supplier to a 4.  However, I do not think I will purchase from this website again due to customer service being non existent.  If a problem does arise, I'm afraid I won't be able to contact anyone.____________________________________________________I can't seem to get anyone to contact about my order.  I got a confirmation and order number after my purchase on the website, but received no email, the chat doesn't work or at least no one answers it, and I can't get customer service on the phone.  It's just a recording that instructs to go back to the website to check on the order.  However, there is no where to put in the order number, name or address.  It's been six days since I placed the order.  If I don't receive the order within the next 4 days, I will have no alternative but to call my bank to see if I can get the charges reversed."

So the delivery person just dumped it on my front doorstep outside my locked door and left, REGISTERING IT AS \"DELIVERED TO PORCH!!\"  Evri promises 3 attempts to deliver and I was waiting for success/failure of first attempt to update instructions if necessary. I was fortunate that a friend was looking in on my cats and was able to take the parcel in.  Where I live, it would otherwise have been stolen before my return. So.. Battery Depot themselves, I'd have given 5, but their choice of delivery service unfortunately lost them a point."

She'd managed to knock the power switch off before her Sunday bridge games and the laptop died mid game. A short diagnosis of the fault and a search when I returned home brought up several potential suppliers. Battdepot had both the smaller and the larger capacity, easily identifiable, at the right price. The replacement arrived in a couple of days and was fitted soon after that. Problem solved.p.s. I've just received her shopping list for the weekend via email and I've no doubt I'll be called on to help print off pictures of her great grandson when I drop the shopping off."

Big thank you."

NO answer or response.   My advice avoid buying anything from them , I got ripped off.Up date to Battdepot,  The battery was sent back to Battdepot. Upon testing it  was determined that the battery   performance was according to spec. The issue I had could not be duplicated. Apparently Lenovo has a issue sometimes with a non factory batteries. Battdepot responded to confirm my active credit card and refunded my cost for the battery. Thank you for their professional service.  G. Hastings"

One of the cells in the last replacement battery (from another supplier) died just after a year so i'm interested to see how this one is.  This battery was much cheaper than a hp one (although you can't buy them anymore) and also the previous replacement.  Based on my last experience I decided to go for low price as most suppliers appear to give a one year guarantee anyway so I've resigned myself to replacing it again after a year anyway.  That way I can only be pleasantly suprised!"
