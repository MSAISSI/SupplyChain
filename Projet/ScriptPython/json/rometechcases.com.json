When the battery came, the connector didn\u2019t fit the existing connector.  The website said z935 and I got the impression from other websites that z935 and z835 used the same RTC battery.  I contacted customer support to see if either myself or the company made a mistake.  I sent pictures of the battery with some caliper measurements of the connector plug, and they were able to find a compatible replacement.  I was able to replace the battery and get rid of my bios boot error.  Kudos to Rome for breathing new life into my old laptop and for working with me to find a replacement.  You may have better luck sending a picture of your battery first to customer support before you buy if your exact model isn\u2019t labeled in their site."
