          "Contenu": "Let me start by saying the good far exceeds the not so great. What disappoints? The microphone mount takes an inordinate amount of force to lock down.The microphone is heavy and shock mount just droops down unless you REALLY crank down on the locking knob. I have found that mounting it upside down is better... it lowers the  center of gravity and is more  stable in this configuration.What's good? The fit and finish is excellent, and the  sound is warm and lush. Seriously, our  vocalist used it for vocals for the first time at a practice session and even going through a small Mackie mixer into a pair of powered monitors with no effects or EQ and it was stunning."

          "Contenu": "Great mic for the money. Vibes are similar to an actual u87i. Definitely not one but a cool mic with more drip than anything else at the price point. They forgot about 1/2 the components in my order so I had to wait even longer than expected which was a major bummer. They did hook me up with an extra capsule tho so I gotta give them credit there. Speaking of capsules, im not too sure how I feel about the quality of the capsule itself. It seems to be the only questionable thing in the kit...which I found odd because they advertise themselves primarily as a capsule manufacturer. There is a definite \"burn in\" time you will need to do before the mic is really ready to go.....or at least that was my experience. The capsule sounded quite bad and harsh at first. It took a couple of weeks of constant usage usage to start evening out....and its still doing so slowly 2 months later. The build isn't too difficult if you're handy with a soldering iron and following directions....carefully. I will admit that they could definitely improve the build by taking the time revamp the instructions. (hopefully in the new kit) Overall, my experience with this product was.......eh ok. I marked this as 4/5 so my honest review gets through. 3/5 is what I'm actually giving it overall. I did receive one of the very last of the old kits so hopefully things are better with the MKII"

It's a bit cruder than a Neumann, you get a pretty loud pop when you change patterns , but for the money I'm very happy to abide a few quirks. it sounds fantastic. Smooth, full of mid range, sounds high end. sounds old.  Best mic purchase, you will not be disappointed. unless you've got cloth ears."

Although there was an extended wait time due to the well-known \"supply chain\" issues that have been experienced globally, this was not the fault of Dachman Audio. DA's customer service is exceptional - very responsive and thoughtful.I can be VERY critical, and don't give many 5-star reviews.

A friend of mine recommended it based on his experience with the previous version, this one is a lot smaller than the one he built and recommended.The build is a bit more difficult than what I experienced before with preamps and EQs but very well explained on the booklet, so I really didn\u2019t have any questions, but just followed the instructions and completed the microphone in a few hours of fun work. It worked immediately after I plugged it in and it really sounds stellar, I showed the results to many people and everyone is blown away. It really sounds \u201cexpensive\u201d. But it\u2019s not.I might get a second one for the pair sometimes soon."

          "Contenu": "Listening to audio demos I was impressed with the DA-87i mic. Second time I was impressed was when I saw the price. Third time was when I tried recording vocals, voice-overs, guitar... an exquisite combination with my 73 preamp. Always wanted an 87-style mic and now finally it's here.Gripes are that import duties must be added to the purchase price when ordering from Europe. The container box is swell enough but the wooden lid doesn't perfectly align with the bottom part. The screw for attaching the mic to the shockmount is squeaky. Shockmount is nothing special and the small size of the wing (that locks the shockmount angle) makes it hard to get enough tension for the mic to stay rigidly in place - I would design it larger so you get more torque. But these are minor things. The sound from the microphone is lovely. Level of customer support arising from order delay was exceptional. All in all no regrets and I would buy again. Thanks Dachman!"

How does the mic sound?  Great.  What does it sound like?  A Dachman, which is not a bad thing.  I can't comment on how it compares to a Neumann, I don't own one.  I do own various Mic Parts mics, and the Dachman is every bit as good as they are.  It's also beautifully made."

I enjoyed the build very much.The mic sounds beautiful. I'd compare it favorably to my Neumann TLM 102, but with far greater flexibility. I look forward to trying it out as the figure-8 in a M/S configuration.When I had some noise problems after completing the build, I wrote for support, and immediately received a thoughtful and useful email, which served to make the mic pin-drop quiet."

I\u2019m blown away!  I\u2019m sure that it matches the U87 even better. We double recorded and with a 1.5 dB roll off at 2k on the Dachman you could edit between the 2 mic\u2019s no problem. Congratulations on making such a wonderful mic.  So glad that I purchased it."

A few steps were a bit difficult and required a second set of hands to complete. He had a lot of fun completing the kit and the resulting microphone sounds amazing! This is not something for a novice. I would definitely recommend it to someone who enjoys DIY and loves high quality audio gear. Dachman customer service is the best I've seen anywhere. I was trying to get this by Christmas and they worked with me to get it in time. After the microphone was built, my son had some technical questions. Dachman responded extremely quickly with answers that were extremely helpful and solved all his issues."

It's not the most expensive mic I have, so I've already got my money back just on vocals and acoustic guitars, piano. I've even had luck as it being a solo room mic for the drums. The mic does what all good gear does: demonstrates it's eagerness to be invited to the party! Again and again."

Take your time and clean the board when the instructions say to. Cleaning will pay dividends. Use acetone or nail polish remover, Rubbing alcohol has no effect on the flux residueI took three nights of 2 hrs each to assemble the kit and it worked 1st time. No hum, buzzing., 60hz pickup at all. The Mic is super sensitive at low volumes and will pick up any little annoyance in the room. I had to remove the batteries in a clock in different room when test recording an acoustic guitar as it was plainly heard during quieter sections.I was very impressed and if you have a good amount of soldering experience its a rewarding few days of assembly to get a quality product."
