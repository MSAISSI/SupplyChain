In the state that it\u2019s in right now, there\u2019s no way to turn it off. (Except letting the battery run dead.) There\u2019s no reset button. What I have is a big blue paper weight. I should have read the App Store reviews before purchasing it and 2 sets of tags."

          "Titre": "Not as good as it should be. There a reason Tonies are better reviewed",
          "Contenu": "I just got a jooki 2 and the initial impression of the packaging, web site etc are very good.Then come the hurdles. 1. To set it up the first time you are obliged to have, in my case, an android phone, download their app. up to here not so strange.the strange part is where you will have to register and give some of your data to them. Without this you can't use the product at all. It gets worse. Then you need to give location permissions and only then you can configure the wifi on the product.. Yes the wifi.So after you connect with bluetooth you need to configure the Wifi. this wifi is one of your choice but typically the one from your home. this means again, that you give access to your home wifi to an unknown box that does an unknown number of things.then...you need to connect with your phone to the same wifi network where the jooki box is and only then you are allowed to interact with the product.In summary: without wifi it doesn't work. (forget about hidden Wifi, forget about VPN's you might have, forget about security in general). The USB cable is not used to connect to a PC at all. it's really just for charging and nothing else.2. The reason it get a 2 star instead of a one star is the fact that once you get it working properly, and you're able to send the MP3 files (you can also use spotify, which I didn't want) it's really easy to use and the sound quality is not so bad.3. to get to the 3 star at this point everything must be fully ok...it's not. the orange buttons only work if you rotate them fully. for this you need a certain strength and dexterity. so my 3 year old son is completely frustrated and sad because he keeps rotating the knob but never enough for it to work.4. The figurines are ok, the material is soft to the touch and are relatively easy to fit in the music slot. Overall construction looks solid although I haven't put it much to the test because as I mentioned my son is really sad that the buttons are not usable.Suggestion to jooki. Please really improve on the connection method of this product. I'm not exactly illiterate (I'm an IT engineer) and I didn't find it user friendly at all."

          "Contenu": "While the Jooki is awesome and is a great concept, we are disappointed by the control buttons on it.  They are difficult to use/ to turn when choosing/skipping a song. Such an expensive item should be easy-to-use for the child who uses it, but it is even difficult for an adult to use. The button needs to be turned A LOT to skip a song and the tokens on the Jooki can get in the way.  A different system should be used to skip the songs.  Also, the extra tokens (to be purchased separately) do not have a loop on them and cannot be gathered together and tied to the Jookie. The Jookie cannot easily connect to any wifi, it has to be specifically matched to an address, which is a pain when travelling and wanting to change songs.  The volume control system only has two settings, which is also a little annoying.  Aside from that, the speaker box sounds ok and the tokens are easy to install on the Jooki.  It recharges fast enough and last for a long car ride which is handy."

Set up was a bit difficult, as finding the songs we wanted to buy as MP3 files was a bit tricky, and we used Amazon music but it\u2019s a pain to download your music files. We made some tokens play MP3 playlists and some play Spotify playlists. Our daughter likes both. There are 2 knobs on the Jooki. Our daughter can use the volume knob easy enough, but does not have the wrist strength to use the skip song knob. So I would recommend the company change that. However, all that being said, our daughter still uses the Jooki to play songs and we love not having to use our phones for her music!"

We had a lot of CDs already and didn't want our kids to ruin them, also we want them to listen to songs, that other kids player producers definitely wouldn't have in their selection. In addition my husband speaks a different language and can record and connect stories in his language so that the kids can practice that as well. The support team is very helpful. I have had about 3 times minor problems, where I didn't know how to use the software. Everytime they responded very quickly and helpfully. The first generation jooki has the USB-port for charging in a very unpractical place, which is why we ruined two chargers already. I hope the new generation has changed that but I wouldn't know. Still, I think jooki is the best choice for parents who like choices."

We even have a custom made playlist with family audio recordings, and this I find it to be very unique for a toy. The jooki, as advertised, really does help get her off the tv which I\u2019m really happy about.The battery is long lasting and the figurines are tough. She throws them around from time to time due to the excitement and they don\u2019t even get scratched on our tiled floor.The customer service is also great! One of the figurines wasn\u2019t working for me when it arrived and they were friendly and quick to respond. They gave me the choice to have it replaced or reset the nfc chip in the figurine myself following the instructions they provided. I went for the latter and in no time I had the figurine working again.I would recommend jooki to any parent. Definitely a must have for a child."

To be completely honest, I struggled a bit with the set up at first. It took me a few minutes to get use to the mechanics of the app, but once you get it, it is actually pretty easy to set it up. And the device in itself is really accessible for young children. So easy to use! I reached out to the Jooki support team once for a small connexion issue. They were prompt to reply and really helpful. It was fixed in just a minute. I really recommend Jooki to people with small children!"
