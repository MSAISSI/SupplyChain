We have had a lot of negative feedback about the financial side for clients. They don\u2019t get receipts sent to them, which they don\u2019t like and when their payment method needs to be updated, they can\u2019t don it on their end as an automatic payment and that causes a lot of work for us. It\u2019s not always the most user friendly to navigate and it seems there are a lot of little bugs being worked out. I\u2019m happy with the price, but I have had a ton of people emailing because they don\u2019t know how to do certain things or find us in the app, which is incredibly time consuming and frustrating for us. Would really like for there to be some improvements made as I like the team and concept of the app."

They get back to you right away and are super helpful. They also give you references with their answers. There are a few things I wish Fit Degree offered. Mainly, a way to sign children up under their parent profile. I have lots of kids classes. A lot children don't have their own email yet, which is required to sign up. If families have multiple children, this presents issues. They have to 1- figure out how to sign each kid up with different emails, and 2- make a profile for each kid which means if they want to sign up their 3 kids, they have to login and log out 3 different times to get all of their children signed up. This creates a lot of work for them. It's way too many steps.The other feature I would like to see is easier reporting. I want to see exactly who my monthly members are and have all of their emails in one place. I want to know in advance if someone is going to hit a milestone club count. I want an easier way to track monthly attendance by purchase. I think the Fit Degree team is great and I hope these changes will happen in the future."

It should be more user friendly when it comes to registering for an account. Having a client register intentionally for  your business but you can't see them unless they actually click on something in the app is frustrating as a business owner. It sounds unprofessional to say \"just click something and then I will be able to see you\". That's an issue that happens AFTER having to list 15 steps for registration on a website (that no one reads and then I have 15 different areas that I have to cover to figure out where things went haywire in the process).  If someone is on the website or the app and clicks that they want to register for a class, that should be automatic once they pay and they shouldn't have to go follow up on it.  I will say the customer support is fantastic, unless it's the weekend and then you're going to have to wait until the next business day.Being a new customer, I feel like I will learn to resolve some of these issues, but it shouldnt take 15 steps to get connected to me regardless of whether I have those possible issues with each step committed to memory yet."

However, it is tough when no one is around on the weekends if there are any urgent matters. I also think there are a few features that the app would benefit from - one being the ability to customize confirmation emails (our building is security coded, so it makes it difficult when we can\u2019t put any further info in the confirmation email). Or, maybe have a section to write some studio info on the app by the phone number/address or something? The other feature that would be helpful is when a class is canceled, instead of having it disappear from the app, display it as \u201ccanceled\u201d. But overall, I would highly recommend FitDegree. It\u2019s been such a game changer for us!"

I have a few kids classes and it is really difficult to make a profile for each kid because not all of them have emails or phone numbers. If they were under the parent account, I wouldn't have to worry about that. Then the parents could sign them up easily without having to log off their account and log into each kids account. I have parents who have 3 or 4 kids, and it is just so much work for them. I fear that they won't keep signing up because it is too much of a pain."

There are a few functions that are clunky.I am getting use to it.  And it seems silly but the colors used in the on the go app are difficult to read. Black letters on blue background can be very difficult for color blind teachers to read. This is when checking attendance on up coming classes. I would like the ability to color code the classes on the schedule. This sounds like a lot but I am very happy with this software.

It has been affordable, reliable even with some update bugs from time to time, and exactly what we needed to run our new yoga studio. The customer service is incredible and I have not experienced tech support for when issues or questions come up like this before. They are on it!Along with us our customers find it easy and intuitive to use and operate.  Creating classes, events, or series is simple and just makes sense."

All the bonus features, like friending people, seeing how full a class is, events posted as if it were an ad and I can't wait to use the video promos. Owning 5 studios with 40+ teachers, it's hard to spread the word about sales, workshops and events but now the students see it every time they sign up..BOOM!Seriously, thank you for helping us along the way. FD will be dominating the market soon.. good luck"

Needless to say, we just switched BACK to fitDEGREE after we realized that 1.) Our Clients really LOVED the fitDEGREE app, and a year later were still wishing for it and 2.) The customer service of the big company does NOT hold a candle to the team at fitDEGREE.   I wish we hadn't left!"

Training is great and copies of all the meetings are provided for reference. If you cant figure out what you need again the customer support is great. Client feedback has been great.

She was a wealth of knowledge and presented all all of the material i needed to learn in an organized and meaningful fashion. She sent me an email before we met each time stating exactly what we would cover and left me with specific homework to complete for the next time we met. She recorded each session and sent them to me for reference. l am a visual learner and Christine accented that in her teachings. She always made time for questions and never made me feel like I was asking too many of them. I felt like I was Christine's only client. She was so focused on my new studio and needs and remembered all the details I told her about it from one session to the next. Christine even helped me with some changes on my website to make booking classes easier for my clients. I feel like I can reach out with a question that may come up down the road and Christine will be there for me. I am so happy I chose fitDEGREE!"

It is the most important resource for running my business and I 100% trust the fitDEGREE team as they continue to make the platform better and better. They listen to user suggestions and implement them in an even better manner than the users imagined. They are always thinking of their users and consistently do the right thing. It's fun to see them grow but continue to be 'touchable' and successful with their service-centric foundation. Oh! And they are WAY MORE reasonably priced than any other platform out there. Go fitDEGREE!"
