I contacted their support 10 seconds after and asked them to downgrade and either refund the rest or add it on top to increase the period.None of it was possible, they wouldn't refund it or add it ontop, so I haven ow paid $100+ for their premium hosting, which is suppose to cost around 40 dollars. I would also like you to pay attention, if you go to Hostinger Company Activity, how they have flagged 100+ 1 starred review the past months to get them removed from Trustpilot.I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone"

          "Contenu": "I am concerned about the security of my personal data associated with my Hostinger account. Recently, I have been receiving unsolicited commercial emails and phishing attempts from a domain impersonating Hostinger. These messages are sent to an email address exclusively created for and used with Hostinger, which I have not shared publicly. Additionally, I am receiving marketing communications from third-party companies to the same email address. Notably, the phishing emails seem to be specifically targeted, indicating awareness of my Hostinger account. I want to clarify that my device is secure, and there have been no breaches in my email security. This situation leads me to suspect either a compromise of Hostinger's database or an unauthorized sharing of customer information with external parties. I am seeking an explanation and urgent resolution to this matter.Update:Thank you for your prompt response. I have provided all the requested information and am now awaiting your team's investigation into the recent issue I have encountered.While I am pleased with the service overall, I would like to emphasize that privacy is of paramount importance to me."

I had to delete the website entirely and start from scratch since I\u2019m on a tight deadline. I had high hopes kicking it off with hostinger as I was planning to host client websites on the platform. The checkout system also seems to have glitches. It charged me twice! I have applied for a refund, let\u2019s see how that goes. If I don\u2019t get my refund within the time period, I will be taking further steps. I might also ask for a refund for the package i intended to buy as well and move on to another hosting platform in the next couple of days unless Hostinger provides me with a timely service guarantee and fixes these issues. In which case i will edit this review. But seriously, customer service isn\u2019t their strong suit. Nothing seems to beat namecheap when it comes to customer service."

Now, I\u2019m considering a hosting service with a different content moderation policy. I\u2019ve also reached out to the author of the comment (which led to the site being shut down) and informed him that his comment was removed due to a site-blocking threat from my hosting provider.

I just spent 1 hour and 45 minutes before getting another transfer (end of shift or just transfer) without any kind of help. It looks like the old team from the call centers is now working for Hostinger, the ones who put you on hold and ask you to spell your name 5 times before they transfer you to another unhelpful person. Every single reply came about 10 minutes later as if it was timed, with no update or help at all, then after 30 or 45 minutes, a transfer. I had a very easy case, a serious technical issue and my request to escalated was not done until... they run the clock enough times pretending they are actually helping a customer. They are not, they just put you on hold, or reply every 10 minutes just to scam their employer. I hate ChatGPT taking jobs but if you ever wonder, this is the reason why that happens, the dirty old lazy tricks of the call center \"support\" staff. You can see that the negative feedbacks are mainly related to support. I think they should buy SiteGround.com and have their staff take over, they are 1,000 times better."

What other reason would it be only available on their AI builder but not WordPress? Which does not have the same features, flexibility, and customization options as WordPress.I suggest Hostinger reconsider their decision and bring back the option to choose a domain later for WordPress websites, or else they will lose many customers like me."

Had I not checked my site, which on the whole I don't really need to do that often it would have been down for much longer than the 5 days. I rely on my site for new business. So when enquiries dropped to zero i knew something was wrong. Hostinger have cost me potentially thousands in lost revenue.

          "Contenu": "I purchased a 48-month or 4-year plan for single-site hosting on February 10, 2023. Then, in November 2023, I found that they had converted my site to a yearly renewable plan for one year, which is more expensive. They did it without my concern. I asked them to join the live chat. They didn't give me any clear answer, and they kept harassing me for more than an hour.Still, they didn't give me any clear answer as to why they did it and how they would solve their cheating. My name is Sayed Sudip Ahmed, and they can track my complaint easily. I filmed the whole thing by screen recording and will soon share it.Later on, they said I did it myself. My card was not added to their system, and I was not charged any money for this action. They did it silently without my concern.Later, they said they credited some amount to my account, but I had to buy another or the previous plan. I tried to buy the previous plan, but they blocked my card, so I can not make any transactions on their site.  Indirectly, they asked me to remove my review from truepilot. Do not trust Hostinger.Do not trust them with your website."

On the day I found out I also need a license to a admin system. Makes sense. Most VPS have this. But they did not inform me only premium prices are available. So now the prices is double. And the panel is none-refundable. I choose a version that was most affordable for my needs. Ok lets activate it. The panel environment was supposed to take 15 minutes to activate and load the license. 24 hrs later. No game. It shows as no active license on the board panel login. While active on the admin. I contacted them 4x no reply at all. Nothing. And surprise, the 30 day refund is also not available because I am not located in the US. Even if here on the EU 14 days is mandatory. Scammers, tossers, and totally incapable from the replies I did get. So 156 + 80 euro down the drain for absolutely nothing. Do not do it!!! If you want a good party in my area the Netherlands's try Transip. Which I should have stuck with."

But then, a couple of minutes after getting a refund, was billed again for the same thing.In the end decided to keep the renewal due to my main service provider not supporting the TLD in question. But after this experience, I will be looking a new place to do business with.This has seriously damaged my trust for this company.There is also the fact that in legal documents on the site, it's mentioned that Hostinger is based on Latvia.

Because I got charged and support said we can't refund and suggested me to sell it on SEDO. I went on that website and hostinger was not even in the list of registrars. Then I contacted again and they suggested few other steps. Isn't that an amazing corporate excuse of let us keep charging you for the things you don't even need or remember that you have. Most of the people won't even go to SEDO to go through all hassle but even if you do TADA! they don't even exist in their list."

Instead we had to open a new domain!!!A refund has been requested and we will see if they manage to live up to their costumer information such as the 30 days money back guaranteeWe will of course update this information as the days go by..Sad to tell, but no more Hostinger- as it has been a bad experience for us..To be fair- A refund has been made. And the support has been all ok. .But they have allocated the cost to another domain that we don't even needed. And for this domain you cant claim a refund..In order- You buy a domain- lets say a .com- You select a free email to that domain name, later you discover the mailbox is to small for you. Then you can NOT change the email address if you upgrade and want  a bigger inbox on the same domain!!! Instead u have to buy a new Domain and use the upgraded mailbox.....Ohh I give up!! Cause its really weird...!!- Let us hope they will change this complicated way of upgrading a simple mailbox."

Support told me they can make a refund only to my account balance because I paid via crypto. And I don't want it on my balance. It's my money and I want it where it came from - on my crypto wallet. So if you pay with crypto they just steal your money, they won't return it to your wallet if they refuse to provide you their services for some reason.

For backups for each website separately you have to install plugins on that site or take a backup by ftp and they are complicated for backup and restore. I Use other web hosting and they don't have this limitation.I Hope hostinger do something for this. this review is for people like me with little knowledge but I am happy with hostinger support and speed and price"

          "Contenu": "I subscribed to a business email account. I then found out a couple months later that there was a conflict with the business name and so I needed to change my domain. I asked Hostinger support if I could associate the new domain to the email plan I was paying for. I was told that I needed to purchase a new email plan for the new domain. I tried to ask if they can just downgrade the plan on the original domain and then give me the upgrade for my new domain for free... they said no because they will not issue a refund for the original account I'll no longer be using because it's over 30 days (it's been 48 days). Why in the world can they not change the domain associated to the email plan? I am a 1 star level upset about this and am now looking at alternative providers, but I've given 2 Stars because I do actually like their services and I know it's going to be a pain to find another provider whose services I like (but hoping the customer service will be better elsewhere)."

          "Contenu": "Let me be honest with you. They are giving the best hosting service out there. I have used almost all hosting services. They are also not bad. But Hostinger's user experience and performance is much cooler & awesome than others. However, Hostinger's customer support is the worst one. I had to contact their live support many times, first they appear on chatbot after 10 minutes. And then they take like another 10 minutes to reply one line and so on. So if you are not a technical person who can't google and sort out problems on your own, as a Hostinger user, you're out of luck.The other features are very cool though. Their hpanel, UX/UI, AI systems, everything is way better than Bluehost, Hostgator, Namecheap or Godaddy. Their only problem is live support. (Maybe the reason is their AI support or a lot of helpful blogs and Youtube videos - so they thought there is no room for live support maybe).That's the honest review from me. Best wishes."

I believe addressing these issues will contribute to enhancing the overall quality of service.It appears that the support provided lacks commitment in its responsiveness, particularly during critical situations and urgent needs. The level of service in these circumstances has been perceived as weak and irresponsibly handled.Database Naming Request:I have been actively involved in the website migration process for several days. Unfortunately, my initial request regarding the customization of the second part of the database's name, a feature supposedly changeable, has not been acknowledged. Despite multiple communications with the customer service team, this seemingly straightforward request remains unfulfilled.Incomplete Site Migration:Upon being notified of the successful completion of the migration process, it came to my attention that the site had not been fully transferred. Essential components such as subdomains, databases, and email accounts were overlooked by the migration team and not moved to Hostinger.Disorganized Files:The extracted files from the backup are disorganized, leading to unnecessary additions of folders and files. This has resulted in increased inode usage and memory consumption.Refund Operation:I purchased a plan with the expectation of a smooth refund process. Despite providing my order number to customer service and assurances that no charges would be deducted, an amount for the initially promised free domain was deducted. Regrettably, when I pursued this matter, I received only an apology without a resolution."

Stripe does not support that country but Paypal does. I asked their customer support why I cannot add or link the Paypal payment option and they advised it is not supported for the region or country. Then I sent the customer support rep a link showing that Hostinger provides hosting services in Argentina hostinger.com.ar and also the ecommerce option with 500 product limit. So what payment portals do they use if that is the case? I have the Paypal business account in Argentina which means that they service that country but the only thing the customer rep said is that there is a currency issue where Paypal does not accept ARS$, that is the whole point of the exchange rate if dealt with another currency. If you don't want to have issues with payment portal options with Hostinger, I suggest you research more on the hosting provider and ensure the options you are looking for are available especially if it will be an online store. Thank you"

Their help (which is really poor) blames my home ISP but now my mobile data and IT consultant have now been blocked too.  Works just fine from Belgium and Birmingham ... but I don't live there.  They say to try a different server but don't seem interested in understanding the cause of the problem or actually fixing it.Another problem is that they don't offer a wordpress.com migration service.  Part of the reason I moved was to have all my websites in the same place.  Frustrating.When migrating it is seems to be impossible to preview the new website without changing the nameservers and making it go live.  Tried for ages to try to understand how to do this but just got copy / paste responses to change my 'hosts file' - which didn't work.  It is possible that this is related to the first issue about being blocked from my own sites but all the 'help' seem unable (or too stretched) to actually take the time to understand the problem and, you know, help with it.Stressful and disappointing."

Just an over all bad experience which I truly regret using. The one thing I do like is the support and they are normally very friendly and most times fast, however I cannot rely on everything running smoothly and I dont want to worry about issues and should not have to but I do."

AI is a great technology, but human communication is still the best at this point (thankfully!).Aug 6 - I signed up about a month ago (2 domain names + hosting). The \"product\" itself is fine (control panel, tech stuff, WP intergration,etc). HOWEVER the \"Customer Success team\" is an AI which is unable to address out-of-the-box issues. When you have one of those, you are sucked into a black hole, and you remain stuck. I was billed twice on the same day for one domain registration + 2 accounts seem to have been created, although both with the same email address, and merging them or somehow resolving the issue appears impossible. At this point, I just want to cancel everything and go elsewhere - but how? The AI \"helper\" doesn't want to address that either. eeek! I never write these types of reviews - but it might be the only way to attract the attention of a real human to address the technical glitches I am facing. Time is our most precious asset. I have now lost many hours trying to resolve this. PS: I have 20+ years experience with various hosts. Wanted to give Hostinger a try."

After that i can not send email to users - it has the same issue again and again. so I reactivate status. but it has the same result.also when i create a new email account it has the same issue, it can not send email to users.I reached chat and email support, I don't know what they do, but emails work fine after they reach support, but every 2-3 days the same issue occurs again.I have sent only 1143 emails from 130000, what is the meaning of 100 accounts ... if you can not send email from any single account perfectly."

If you do not need particular help, it is all fine but if you need to get in contact with them, 7 working days or even 1 working day can easily become weeks or months if you do not keep reminding them you are waiting for some help. I could not access my account anymore because the 2AF was not supported by my phone anymore and so I had to wait for more than a month to have this problem solved. Not being able to access my account, and so to the chat with experts, meant that the only mean of communication were emails managed by many different people with a lack of internal shared infomation resulting in asking for info already provided or telling me the info were not available while two days before they had already granted me the access. Customer care is really important when you deal with online services and if this bomes difficult, then you start to look if there are better providers.As my domain hasn't being effectively used by me for a website, I cannot say if there are practical problems or difficulties in using this product but I will certainly think about what it is better to do in terms of keeping the domain with Hostinger or moving it to another hosting provider. So, all things considered, I would strongly recommend Hostinger to improve the responding time and customer care efficiency when peopole, for any reasons, cannot access their account anymore and so cannot chat with Hostinger staff."

Not having the ability to make a video a section background is a MAJOR problem for those wanting a more advanced site appearance. Also disappointing to not have parallax scrolling options. However, the options available are very easy to apply and the overall site quite intuitive to navigate.

They checked one more time and replied that there had been no transactions from that card, I could see them in my online bank though. I wrote to support and the account recovery again but that time the latter didn't answer. I don't know why the things are going this way. We are talking about $40.

Still, I was lost in the interface and did my best to suck it up and wade through the mess I'd made with needing to transfer sites to my new account. I reached out through chat for help. I got a lot of generous help from Simonas. Thank you Simonas. His shift ended. I was passed onto Mantas who offered no help, only links and a fee to solve my problems. I asked for Simonas back, I was passed onto Fikri. Fikri picked up where Simonas left off with excellent help.The mess I created with my sites and account happened because I got lost on the Hostinger site between choices. The solution required creating sites, deleting sites, managing back end files and databases, and renaming backup folders, as well as resetting a password for an individual site. I was given links to follow that contained more links, and even then some steps that I was guided through weren't in the linked help.I'd like to give a higher rating for the fantastic help that 2 out of 3 people provided, but it was more than that. The resources aren't customer friendly meaning that not all help pages are helpful."

These sites include capcutstudio.com ,capcutstudio.net ,capcuteditor.net , all of which are registered with Hostinger's Domain Name Service. It is evident that these websites are phishing pages, as they have copied the template from the legitimate company capcut.com. The downloads on these sites are clearly Trojans, as verified by various online virus scanner services and flagged by Google Safe Search as scam pages. However, the Hostinger staff responsible for abuse reports (abuse @ hostinger.com) appear to be quite ignorant. They don't take any substantial action and only request more \"deep\" information. The fact that these pages are phishing attempts is clear to the naked eye, evident through downloads and scans by online scanner services, and verified by Google Safe Search. I am deeply disappointed with the company's security quality and the lack of diligence and awareness among Hostinger staff regarding internet security. I cannot rate them higher than one star for their quality.Edit: After Hostinger's staff has seen this message, they cleared these phishing domains in less than 24 hours. Thank you very much; you saved many victims from these scams."

Second, there are a few agents who couldn't resolve issues for me, even though some issues were so easy and didn't take long to resolve. Third and most recent, I was told the wrong @TXT to put in GoDaddy's DNS zone. Having said that, Hostinger is the best hosting company I've ever used. I prefer Hostinger to some other hosting companies I used before switching to Hostinger. But Hostinger needs to improve the quality of live support which will help to outperform its competitors."

This builder should be developed for those who wanted to build more big and unique website. I have also used WIX builder it is to some extent a replacement to WordPress.But the hosting and domain services are great. No comparison as I have used godday, WIX, Square space.

This was not explained or being informed earlier in any publication or instructions. I don't see the relevance requiring someone to officially register by opening an account if there is no intention of using Hostinger as the web host but as a developer. In my opinion an unnecessary added step in the process of granting access to my developer."

If you are interested in buying the hosting for 4 years, you will be scammed for sure.Update: They fixed it after 4 days since purchase. I hope they will be aware to not happen this in future."

When you buy a hosting the options list free SSL, but they don't say that is only if you also choose a free domain or you opt to transfer it to hostinger. Also, after buy the SSL for my client's domain I realize that it isn't working for subdomains, just for the main one.The support is great, but those two problems probably make me look for another provider services."

Their customer support is also quite responsive and helpful, and I appreciated their live chat option, which allowed me to get help quickly.However, I did run into some issues with their service that prevented me from giving them a higher rating. First of all, their uptime is not as reliable as I would have liked. I noticed several instances where my website was down for a few minutes at a time, which impacted my visitors' ability to access my site.Secondly, their user interface can be a bit confusing and overwhelming, especially for someone who is new to website hosting.

Apparently, the server structure changed and I wasn't offered a solution to have them migrate my sites to the new system... so, looks like I'll need to spend part of my vacation to organize and hopefully have them migrate correctly the first time.

          "Titre": "Deteriorating Good Perception Of Hostinger",
          "Contenu": "My initial perception when using Hostinger was very positive. However my good perception has deteriorated  substantially. I understood that this platform was about making it easy for a website designer to create a website without writing any code at all. In fact there appears to be instances where your own code, in order to get desired results. becomes mandatory. In my mind this defeats the object of using such a platform in the first place. After all the idea is to save time. One of the great experiences using Hostinger was it's 24/7 live chat window that could easily be accessed while designing the website. It was wonderful and easy to use. While on any navigation page you could simply click on an icon and help was immediately available. If, while conversing you navigated to another page, the chat window would follow so that it was easy to reference an item with the live specialist. For an inexplicable reason their design team has now altered the manner in which help is provided. The 24/7 chat window can now only be accessed via the account management page so that it makes it more difficult to refer to the problem you are experiencing and the chat window no longer pops up anywhere else. I consider such a change as counter productive as it makes it more difficult to raise issues and provides a poor user experience. Why FIX something that was working so well and degrade it?? Hostinger's form design is, in my mind, merely work in progress and does not meet all the facets a designer needs for a well thought out user experience. For example when a user clicks on the SUBMIT button a message is displayed to the user BUT there is no way to set it's font size, font color or placement on the page. Neither is there a way to control how long it should be displayed and the form is not reset until the user navigates to another page. Their web builder lacks a carousel element, text boxes can not have a encompassing border, their image gallery element is very difficult to use with images of different proportions, and they do not support domain names ending with (.co.za ). However, the client is quick to be reminded that all these features may be brought about by using other CMS plans, writing additional code, embedding code snippets or changing NameServers or DNS settings. BUT does this make for a good user friendly experience? I don't think so. Often I ask myself why their design team does not focus on the lacking facilities instead of FIXING and making worse systems that are working well (such as their 24/7 chat window). With the exception of one single chat experience with one bad moment their live specialist are very helpful. Still if I were asked to rate Hostinger as a whole I would have moved from an initial score of 10/10 to 5/10. It's a great pity because they have the capacity to be right at the TOP of hosting and website design platforms available  on the internet."

An example is it will send out highlighted text if you moved text around while composing.  You won't know until it's sent. Appreciate that Hostinger listens to feedback here and through email. They send emails after chat, so I was able to reopen a ticket that way. Their web hosting and tech support has been very good otherwise."

I am still waiting for their response and will update my comment once things are resolved.Another update as on 28th Nov: Finally they found the root cause which was on their end and resolved the issue. Kudos to Manuel who was really helpful and did not talk like others who just did not care and did not extend the support to provide a reliable and genuine response like him. My trust in Hostinger is back after 12+ days of struggling and hunting for a solution. I am updating my rating to 4 for that reason. This is due to the efforts of Manuel who helped me like a pro!"

I have 4 websites and as my plan was due for renewal, I decided to take the great offer of a 4 year plan. This last week I started the transition and generally it went well. I moved the 4 websites and set up email accounts and transferred my old emails. My only issues were in what order to do things. Should I try and transfer email before switching nameservers? The online help was less than clear. I wasted a lot of time trying to get emails transferred and it was confusing as now I was dealing with Hostinger and Titan. Trying to sort out where the problem lay cost a lot of time. When I transferred a website I needed help as the site wouldn't load. I was told to enable Lightspeed cache and flush it....again, I wasted a lot of time. A set of documented steps in chronological order to undertake the transfer would be welcomed and not leave us trying to get help from both Hostinger and Titan.Other than that, the onboarding went well and the ability to transfer old emails to the new email account is something I haven't seen with any other hosting company.Website performance is excellent and now I have discovered how to do things, I will be recommending Hostinger to my clients as their plans on other providers come up for renewal. I will also be recommending Hostinger for all my new clients. I would have given 5 stars were it not for the confusing information on how to transfer websites and emails.Also, to be honest I find the hPanel confusing to work with though I guess I'll get used to it in time.I've watched several youtube videos about Hostinger and am really impressed with their roadmap - I'm also really impressed with the pricing. For my clients who have a good deal of traffic I have used Siteground in the past but Hostinger performance is just as good if not better for a  fraction of the price."

Removed my former pages from the server and started from scratch.  For the most part that worked.

          "Contenu": "Overall, I'm happy with the price-to-performance ratio I'm getting from Hostinger. The plans are very affordable, and the features are great for a beginner or small business. (I use Hostinger for 2 years now, I used before one.com I pay now 1/3 of what I paid by one.com for the same price!)Pros:Affordable: Hostinger's plans are some of the most affordable on the market.Great features: Hostinger offers a wide range of features, including unlimited bandwidth, free SSL certificates, and a free domain name for the first year.Easy to use: Hostinger's control panel is easy to use, even for beginners.Cons:Helpdesk: The helpdesk can be difficult to reach at times.Server speed: Server speed can be slower if you're located in a different region than the server.Specific feedback:Helpdesk: I've had to contact the helpdesk a few times, and it's been hit or miss. Sometimes I've been able to get help quickly, but other times I've had to wait a long time for a response.Server speed: My blog has readers in the US, Europe, and Australia. I've noticed that the server speed is slower for my Australian readers than for my US or European readers. I'm not sure if this is because the server is located in Europe or if it's something else.Overall thoughts:Overall, I'm happy with Hostinger. The price is right, the features are great, and the control panel is easy to use. However, the helpdesk can be difficult to reach at times, and the server speed can be slower if you're located in a different region than the server.Recommendation:I would recommend Hostinger to anyone looking for affordable web hosting with great features. However, if you're located in a different region than the server, you may want to consider a different provider.Additional tips:If you're concerned about server speed, you can choose a server location that is closer to your target audience. You can also use a CDN, such as Cloudflare, to improve performance for users in different regions."

And most of web hosting services doesn't offer running Node.js on shared hosting, which is fine.The only thing that I didn't understand when doing my refund process, I wanted to keep the domain, but to keep it, you need to leave $10 of the refund value to keep the domain. While I got this domain for free from Hostinger for one year, so I didn't understand that part, but I kept it anyway.The user interface and navigation is good and I like it."

When I wasn't able to do so, it was easy to find help and when I spoke with a representative, they were very patient, kind, and attentive.  I would recommend to anyone who is new to creating websites and web hosting as a top-notch go-to for web hosting."

Forget frustrating lag and lost visitors. Hostinger's servers are optimized for peak performance, and it shows. My website has never been zippier.24/7 live chat that actually delivers: No more waiting an eternity for help. Their friendly and knowledgeable support team is always just a click away, ready to solve any issue with lightning speed (pun intended!). I've never had a question go unanswered, and their solutions are always helpful and clear.Seamless user experience: Managing your website with Hostinger is a breeze. Their control panel is intuitive and easy to navigate, even for complete beginners. Plus, they offer a ton of helpful tutorials and guides to get you started.More than just hosting: Hostinger goes beyond the basics. They offer a variety of hosting options to suit your needs, from shared hosting to cloud hosting and even VPS plans. Plus, they have a ton of extras like website builders, free domain names, and SSL certificates.Unbeatable value: Let's not forget the elephant in the room - the price! Hostinger's plans are incredibly affordable, making them a perfect choice for budget-conscious individuals and businesses alike. You're getting so much value for your money, it's almost unbelievable.Honestly, I could go on and on about how much I love Hostinger. But at the end of the day, it all boils down to this: it's made my life easier and my website better.

Correction of these errors was quickly established and the website now works perfectly again - so my sincere thanks to Zhi who also gave me some useful tips on how to identify these errors in the future.  I have also been very impressed with the facilities on the Hostinger website  which greatly helps the administration of the website  - far superior to those of my old host provider.So well done Hostinger, I would recommend to anyone contemplating setting up a website or, indeed, looking for a new host provider."
