          "Contenu": "I'm sorry to write this but I was VERY disappointed. I've spent months looking at various providers offering to help with fitness and weight loss, specifically for over 50's (which sadly I am now!). In particular, I liked the look of chair yoga. But not the gentle, soft touch yoga, I like the more strenuous exercises that genuinely look like they'll increase fitness and help you lose weight. Your advert on Facebook caught my eye, specifically demonstrating the vigorous chair yoga I described. Imagine my disappointment when I downloaded the App and the chair yoga section for men does NOT even exist. There are several ladies versions, not what I want. For males, it was traditional floor style yoga, again NOT what I wanted. After so many months of contemplating, to finally choose your product, I feel completely let down. False advertising, plain and simple. Well you've got my \u00a330, so good for you. I've already deleted the App after less than a week and I will never look at your website or advert again. Poor. Very very poor. \ud83d\ude21"

I sent 2 emails asking for a refund because I am in no way interested in fasting. I did get quick replies, but they just told me where i could access their available videos, that anyone could do them ( with doctor\u2019s permission) and that more videos will be coming. My request for a refund was not addressed either time and the ad said there was a money back guarantee. I requested this within the first 24 hours of seeing the app and realizing it wasn\u2019t what I was looking for. Very disappointed!Update: I was contacted by the company and issued a refund that should be available to me within 10 days.  They were very polite and helpful and they even offered me free informative information on diet and exercise."

Like what is this!!! I did not agree to a partial refund as I do not even partially use this app.. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. This is strait up theft. That\u2019s why they want your banking details up front. They rob people? Stay away.****UPDATE: After writing this review, I was issued a full refund. They apologized and also promised not to auto renew further subscriptions.  Refund was processed quick. And To compensate for any inconvenience they shared comprehensive guides covering various aspects of wellness.  I am honoured they refunded and the way they handled my complaint . Hopefully this fixes the issue. I will update if anything changes."

They ask you to complete a questionnaire about your goals and personal information to create a custom fasting program for you\u2026 then sell you a timer. The ap is rubbish. Nothing is personalised, it\u2019s literally just a timer. You can use your phone timer for free, and there are plenty of other free aps out there that actually offer personalised plans and helpful information. Lasta say that they offer a \u2018100% money back guarantee\u2019 that they tell you about right before you sign up, BUT they make it impossible to redeem. When you can actually look at the ap (once you\u2019ve paid) and you see it\u2019s trash and want to cancel for a refund (I did this within 24 hours of signing up), they refuse your refund saying that you have to prove that you\u2019ve followed their plan for 21 days by sending them photos and videos of yourself making and eating the recipes from the ap. Which no one could ever do. So this is intentionally misleading practices by an unethical company whose only goal is to get your initial payment, then fight you when you ask for a refund because you have actually had a look at the ap and it\u2019s rubbish. DO NOT SIGN UP WHATEVER YOU DO. You can find any of the \u2018tips\u2019 on the internet for free (and better and more useful ones) as well as better and more useful recipes that you can actually make and will actually eat. I\u2019m so disgusted that a company would operate this way and defraud customers over and over again, as evidenced by similar reviews here."

This was copy and pasted from their return policy: Lasta offers a flexible and convenient way of trialing the app: you can choose the price that suits you the most and use the app for one week (3 days) to determine whether or not it fits your lifestyle and needs.  First of all I canceled well within their very conflicting timeline in the app itself.  I didn't realize at the time I was charged $39.12.  Then this past week there was a charge for $83.23 withdrawn from my checking account from an unknown company.  I almost canceled my debit card.  After researching, I discovered it was from Lasta.  I never authorized any amount of money to be withdrawn.  To me, this is THEFT.  I contacted the company and was told that they never received a \"cancellation by email\" so I am not entitled to a refund.  There is literally a cancel subscription option in the app. that I utilized an hour after downloading it.  They did offer me a 30% refund of the latest fraudulent charge and a discount on their services.  I did not agree.  This is strait up theft. Please beware of this company and others that offer a free trial.****UPDATE:  After writing this review, I was issued a full refund.  I was also promised that they would remove their \u201cmisleading\u201d trial period from the app.  As of right now, it\u2019s still there.  At least they honored the refund.

          "Contenu": "I saw the Lasta app being advertised on social media and thought I would look into it. First off, I had to purchase a $50 six month subscription before I could do anything (even take a look at the app). I bought the subscription and downloaded the app. I immediately opened and went through the app which is very confusing with little guidance on how you should fast or even for how long. You basically just get a timer of how long you are fasting. I realized immediately that this wasn't for me so I reached out to them through their contact us for a refund, which stated that I could receive a refund within 30 days of purchase. Days later I hear back from Lasta's customer service telling me I am not entitled to a refund. I reply and tell them that I have read through their refund policy and to please explain why I was ineligible for a refund. They respond and say they will give me a 30% refund. I respond with that is unacceptable and that I wanted a full refund. They respond again, now offering me a 70% refund. I of course, wanted all of my money back, but after days and days, hassle after hassle, I just finally said refund my 70%. I just wanted others who this app may not be for to know how they are. I wouldn't buy this app or a subscription until you have a received a free trial to ensure it's worth your money. Because it definitely wasn't worth mine... not even 30% of it. Terrible business practices here!"

          "Contenu": "I purchased this app based on info in an Instagram ad.  I should know better!  I paid for a 3 month subscription which was supposed to include all the features.  There are plenty of little nuggets on fasting advice and related topics, but info provided is not of any substance and I can find better by myself all over the internet.  I can track my fast and my water intake. I CANNOT access mood tracker, activities, steps, or anything else.  I feel ripped off.  I have some of these features on my Fitbit, and I will get along without the others unless I find an app that fulfills it's promises.  I asked for a refund, but they won't do that (I have only had the subscription 3 days).  So I have told them to cancel me at the end of the 3 month period and that NO additional charges are authorized.  I think they are a fly by night bait and switch operation.  Note to self (again) NEVER EVER purchase anything based on an Instagram ad without doing due diligence first!UPDATE:  6/8/23.  I received email from Lasta offering a 50% refund if I would take down this review.  Initially I asked for a refund, and none was offered.  Prior to that, I had emailed support asking for help how to access features.  I got no response on that request.  The offer of a partial refund to get me to take down this review seems like they want to stifle my opinion.  I would hope others would have a better experience.  I also received email from TrustPiolot that Lasta was requesting my contact information to be sure I had legimately purchased, or my review might be taken down.  They have my contact, I communicated with them and they replied.  I will not be\"paid\" to take down an honest review of my experience."

          "Contenu": "So I heard fasting might be an option for weight loss. Not knowing anything about it when I did a search Lasta came up and looking at their site it looks like there will build a personal plan for you to follow. In bold print it says MONEY BACK GUARANTEE so I figured I had nothing to loss. I filled out all the personal information and figured I would be getting a personalized plan. What I got was a suggestion that I fast for 14hr and then the app turned into a basic timer that you turn on and off... no notices no alerts... if your not opening the app to turn the timer on or off you don't even know its running. So after a day I realized this was a total waste of money so I asked for a refund. I was told I have to wait 14 days then I can get a refund... I thought this was strange but I figured it was a way for the company to try to get people to forget to come back for a refund... I waited 14 days and when I reached out again now they directed me to the fine print which say you have to follow the personalized plan (which they never provided) for the first 14days and you have to provide verification of everything what you eat when you fasted. Of course this is impossible to do so basically you pay them $50.00 for a timer.UPDATE 7/20/23I just got a replied to my review... the standard sorry for the experience... and yes I did get a full refund but only after I had filed a claim with my credit card company."

The phone number they provide simply has a message saying \u201cthey are unable to take calls at this time\u201d and refers you back to the email contact support which just creates more automated messages but does not solve issues or cancel my subscription.Update:After three days I received an email offering a 30% refund. I declined and received another email with an offer for 70%. I respectfully declined again stating my expectation from their stated offer was 100% refund. The next day they refunded 100% and I see PayPal is actually processing it. Just be aware that the fine print terms of their refund (which were not seen when signing up) are complex and bizarre including photographic proof required of the app\u2019s failure to help you lose weight. Even then they only promise partial refund. I am appreciative they agreed to 100%."

So in less than a week I email support to ask for a refund.  They emailed back that they stopped the automatic subscription for me.  That was great, but I emailed back as to when I could expect my refund.  They asked why I was disappointed with the app and when I told them, they told me that I didn't meet their requirements for a refund. They gave me to option of getting free info on how to better do intermittent fasting, or to freeze my account.  I chose to freeze my account as I am using another app now...one that is easy to use and half the price!  So yeah...buyer beware. Read the fine print.UPDATE: that being said, they did specify the conditions of the guarantee which I failed to read. I've increased my review as they worked with me to refund 30%."

Seeing the different recipes is great because I don't always think of healthy foods.  *Idea* It could be a neat idea to help subscribers by allowing them to also post recipe ideas and have someone review these and give input.  The cost is given in 3 forms.  That is helpful."

I also like that notifications were suggested but not pushed on you, but were helpful to keep me engaged in my weightloss journey.One of my favorite things was that the app did not push a certain diet. Instead it allowed me to choose an option, which is great for those who have their own preference for meal planning. One of my favorite things is that this app plots the timeline in which I can expect to plot my goal. That is amazing!The Learn Today feature allowed me to learn about why I feel hungry when I do, what to drink while fasting - which is truly helpful, and helping me differentiate moods from emotions. I enjoyed the healthy food for busy people section, which gives you viable options to eat healthy while on the go. In all, I would definitely recommend this app to anyone looking to take control of their health and lifestyle and reach their weightloss goals."

I was hopping from other apps to websites in tracking my activity, calorie intake, my steps, trying to research meal plans and educating myself in the science of nutrition. When I happen to find this app called Lasta, I was curious to try it as it seems promising in simplifying my weight loss journey. And it truly did. From my experience through this platform, I was able to already see great results within a week of losing 1.5 Ibs. 2x easier.Not only was it very easy to navigate and convenient as everything that you need to achieve your ideal physique is in one place, but they also focus on how to exponentially promote your wellbeing which helped me in developing great self-care habits to become a better version of myself like meditation, doing affirmations, stretching, reading, running, etc. There are many components implemented in the app that has skyrocket the way I have been planning my health. From the daily stories & tips that are highly educational, to daily weight / mood / calorie / fast tracking, planned work-out exercises, and meal plans customized for my calorie goals, it all kept me accountable, informed, and thriving with ease. I feel like without this needed support, I wouldn\u2019t be as consistent in my journey. This platform also saved me so much of my time from having to switch from app to app, website to website and I can now use all of that time that could\u2019ve been wasted researching everywhere to pursue my dreams and work on personal projects. My favorite feature that they provide is that the moment I opened my phone, my fasting tracker pops up at my Home Screen reminding me to be more disciplined and motivated. And also they provide easy and simple healthy meals that are calorie-friendly, inexpensive, healthy in nutrients, and TASTY. (Which I think is the most important part of any meal)The only drawback I could think from this is that their fasting period timers do not go below 12 hours. So if you feel that you can\u2019t fast for half a day, then you may have to stop the timer yourself if you need to. But other than that, most elements in the app are solid.If you either struggle in managing/monitoring your fitness journey or want to start losing weight in a more efficient way, I would recommend Lasta. They have all of the essentials that you need to kickstart your journey all in one app to becoming a more lean and fit person.
