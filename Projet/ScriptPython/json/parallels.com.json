Telling me to press Ctrl+del which unlocked the mouse, but as soon as I clicked again it was locked.  Then after 5 mins of trying to fix it, black screen of death appeared and it crashed.  Lost all my software and I am struggling to fix all the problems it caused by trying to retrieve my expensive software.  No option to speak to anyone.  I subscribed to an expensive package to have support 24/7 \ud83d\ude02 What a joke.  It just takes you to a community forum to ask the public.  Its like the blind leading the blind.  Support never replies and when it does it\u2019s generic and unhelpful. It is easier to buy a Windows computer.  Don\u2019t even bother with this."

You are better off purchasing an inexpensive windows machine because it will meet any needs that you have in computing power that you would get from running windows on parallels. the search function of their data base makes it almost useless. Contacting support generates a regurgitation email where they request the information that you already gave them. After dozens of attempts to contact their support I did get one person that was helpful. I am not sure how it is that they have a Gmbh?? I have never had a German or Austrian person reply, ever. The support people are not English or German speakers."

Not sure if this just happens in the trial version, but when I tried to contact customer support about it, I couldn't find out how to email or contact an actual person. All I got were suggestions to go to the forum, or talk to the bot. Not sure if they reserve live support chat for paying customers, but it doesn't give one confidence to purchase for the full version if you cant even talk to someone about the trail not working as advertised."

They have not responded to my support ticket (created 40 hours ago) or answered messages or posts on their Facebook page. They have created numerous posts on Facebook since I contacted them, but they have blatantly ignored my attempts to contact them about a serious issue with their product. I have been a paying customer of their's for many years. Their product is very flawed, having caused me a number of issues since upgrading to Parallels 16 last year, yet they decide to completely ignore any support requests. I'm apparently not the only one who's experienced problems with their products or poor customer services. I will take this up with my professional translation colleagues on Proz.com. Parallels will not be recommended to anyone from me!"

I explained that I tried installing on multiple m1 Macs to try to see if I can get a specific software that I need to run on Windows, which was why I installed it on a couple extra computers. I also ended up wiping my current intel Mac only to reinstall everything again. Even with this clear explanation, they ask me for my key code. If you have my support number and email, you would easily be able to find my account information and key code. Instead, I get an email about 3-5 days later asking for my key code because I have two of them. I only have one license."

I called again and when I thought I got connected to an agent, the call dropped. Terrible customer experience!!!! After I made this review, someone from the team contacted me only to clarify what my original question was and without empathy nor apologies. I still needed to spell the word apology for the agent to say it. But, isn\u2019t it supposed to be a common courtesy to empathize with the customer if she had a terrible experience with the company? I appreciate that someone reach out to me, but I personally think, they really need to work on their customer service. Getting the customer to buy is one thing, but keeping the customer is another."

Instead of simply solving my account problem, they returned my money, and instead of version 16, I have back a malfunctioning version 14. An important question for this company:\"Do you have a basic knowledge of marketing and how to take care of customers? Are you wasting money on advertising and saving on the care of long-standing existing customers?\"I do not recommend this company even though it has an interesting product because if you have a problem, instead of solving it, you will have to read dozens of pages about other possible problems and eventually give it up. This company may have a good product, but it doesn't even want to take care of its customers.Just as wind kills flowers as this company kills its customers by its lack of interest in the customer and zero support in solving problems."

I've switched to using a PC instead. The frustration is compounded by the fact that I haven't received a response from Parallels yet.I'm eager to resolve this situation promptly.

After I selected this, they show another screen with the SUBSCRIPTION version selected and the non-subscription version showing an increased price of about \u00a3126. This is very mischievous pricing to say the least!  I contacted Parallels support and the person wouldn't accept that this is deceptive pricing and wouldn't tell me how to buy the product for the price on the 'Buy now for \u00a389.99' button I selected on their website. He tried to tell me that that price is only for the subscription but that is not what I selected and it's not what it says on the button.I got around this nonsense by searching for a Parallels coupon and getting approximately the correct price.Other issues:I'm UK based so I wanted to buy Parrallels in pounds sterling and receive their marketing emails in English but as I happen to be in France they are sending their marketing emails in French. I tried via support to point out that they should use the user's language settings not his location for their marketing language but they wouldn't accept what I was telling them. If I had been in China would they have been sending marketing emails in Chinese?I used the trial period to evaluate the product and I thought I would try a program that works without problems on my Windows 10 PC, which happened to be the antivirus AVG-Free. It would not run in the virtual Windows 11 under Parallels. I exchanged emails with their support, as I can't tell if this is a Windows 11 problem or a Parallels problem or that it doesn't run on my Mac's M2 processor.  I got nowhere with their support. I asked them to try it themselves by downloading AVG-Free but they wouldn't. They eventually gave up and told me to contact Microsoft, which of course would be pointless."

Some times performance is ok for one or two sessions, but then it starts to take several minutes to start the VM, and then apps and keyboard and mouse input freeze for 10-20 seconds at a time. There are tons of threads on Parallel's forums about performance with people reporting similar issues, most of which never get resolved.The features set is great and perhaps unmatched, but the performance makes me just want to use competitor's products, even free open source ones.UPDATE:Six days later, and I've still only had one email from Parallels support that didn't help. I've sent multiple technical reports. All attempts to start a chat with someone have been futile."

No attempts to help me have worked and even though they said they were going to accelerate the ticket, here we are, no joy. I finally asked early in December for a refund. The had the nerve to tell me \" Unfortunately, we cannot make a refund, since more than 30 days have passed since the purchase and activation\". Wow. I wonder if Fusion is still around? I used it a long time ago successfully.This site works! Just a few hours after my review, Parallels refunded my money but still said they wanted to see if they could resolve the issue. Not sure I'll take them up on that. We'll see. I'm happy with the refund. Thanks Parallels!"

There is no \u2018pound\u2019/\u00a3 key on my phone?Probably part my lack of experience doing something like this and a few anomalies with the Parallel?

It IS sharp business practices to not offer a substantial rebate when a license was purchased less than 2 months ago, and if that's the pretext to try to shove down your users' throat your subscription model, you're singularly failing at it.Secondly, there is no excuse for your CS not responding to any inquiries on this, see your own forum, there's even a thread about that.Enough said."

We'll see what tomorrow yields.So...after an hour wait and 3 attempts on day 2, I was able to get through.  Technician was very kind but was not able to resolved the issue which will need to be elevated.  I'll keep you posted on what comes next.29 May - The initial technician who helped me has remain engaged but the problem remains.  Thus far I have taken a screen capture that the technician stated was not helpful and that a system report was required.  Upon generating and submitting the system report via Parallels, the technician stated that the report was not readable and requested that I email the files to him.  After attaching the 35 Parallels generated files, Parallels' email server rejected the email I sent stating the email was too large.  I followed up with 35 separate emails, 4 of which were rejected once again by the Parallels email server.  That's where we are at the moment.  I'll keep you posted."

Well, read just a few of the bad reviews and you will soon see what the common problem is:NO CUSTOMER SUPPORTWhen you read a review that says Parallels has no customer support, believe it. All those good reviews? They're people who have never tried to contact Parallels Customer Support. I was one of those people. I have used Parallels for years without needing to contact support. But the first time I need it? Nothing. Because when you need it, it doesn't exist.What more proof? Read Parallels' own Forum. This is my issue, and it is an issue that has obviously affected a lot of people with M1 Macs. But has Parallels fixed the issue or even provided any help to any of these people (myself included)?No. Read and see for yourself: (OK, can't post link, but search the title \".NET framework 3.5 not downloading\")This is not the only issue I have had with Parallels on my M1 Mac. I currently have two outstanding Support Tickets. They have been outstanding for two weeks now and not one of them has been addressed. No emails. No contact. Nada.Parallels will take your money and flip you the bird. Consider yourself lucky if everything works. Then consider what you would do if you were not so lucky and everything stopped working . . . and there was no-one to help you.The icing on the no-Customer Service cake? When I contacted Cleverbridge for a full refund, they replied within hours. The matter was referred to Parallels, which \u2013 suprise, surprise \u2013 did reply (but still not to my outstanding support tickets - go figure!). They replied to inform me I was not entitled to a refund. Even though under Australian law, if you purchase something that doesn't work, you have a legal right to a full refund.The reason for not qualifying for a refund? Because it has been more than 30 days since purchase.The reason it had been more than 30 days? Because I am still waiting after two weeks for someone from Parallels Customer Support to contact me about my issues. I have even sent them follow-up emails and received nothing.If, after reading this, you still want to buy Parallels, why not contact Customer Support yourself to enquire about their products. See how long it takes for them to reply \u2013 or not. Then \u2013 and only then \u2013 make your decision.Still not convinced? Go read some more of those bad reviews and see how many were resolved \u2013 even after Parallels pretended to help them on Trustpilot.Also, have a look at just how many of the bad reviews have been lodged here in the past month and year \u2013 a very large percentage. Why is that? Dont let the Star Rating fool you. They may have been a decent company once, but not any more. I've used Parallels for years, but I'll never use them again. I wish I'd never upgraded.Talk is cheap. Parallels is not.RESPONSE TO PARALLELSThe knowledge base article fix does not work \u2013 it was the first thing I tried,There is a whole thread devoted to this issue, the link to which I cannot post here, but it is on the Parallels Forum and is quite a few pages long.I have contacted you to process my refund. I note that even now I still have no response to my two outstanding support tickets. I will keep Trustpilot updated on how this eventuates.UPDATEIt's a shame Parallels isn't as quick with their customer support as they are to address issues on Trustpilot. So the solution to my problem was apparently to upgrade to Parallels 17. I asked for a refund and it arrived today. Thank you. As much as I am tempted to buy Parallels 17 with the refund, in all this time I still haven't received a response to my two support tickets. I'm sure they've been cancelled by now, but I'm not confident things have changed. I'm adding one more star for the refund \u2013 because at least I got that \u2013 but I don't think I would have gotten it without Trustpilot"

This is what the Parallels website states about support:Parallels Desktop comes with 24/7 phone, chat and email support.* Subscription licenses come with phone, chat and email support available for the lifetime of the subscription.Since the latest update to the MAC OS which is 11.2.1 (Big Sur) on 02/12/2021, the Parallels Desktop Virtual Machine (Windows 10) has not been able to connect to the network or internet.Today I tried the chat support feature and was number 4 in line. Three hours later when I was number 1 in line, the chat box provided this message:We are sorry, all of our operators are off-line at the moment. Please check back later, or use an alternative contact method.Then I tried the phone support number 888-811-2459 and was place on phone hold. The automated response first stated that all operators were busy and that I would be helped when the next operator was available.  After about 5 minutes, an automated message said that all operators were busy and to call back later.This is NOT 24/7 phone or chat support.Additionally, based on Parallels own support discussion forums, these technical problems have been present since early February and Parallels has not been able to resolve the problems and distribute an update to correct it."

          "Contenu": "I\u2019ve installed the trial version of Parallels for Mac. It looks good in general and I was considering buying a $99 license. However, during checkout I\u2019ve come across a price manipulation. After entering details and turning to checkout I got a price which is ~35% higher than the one placed on the main website. Moreover, it is converted by default to my local currency. It seems that this is made intentionally, looking for the people who won\u2019t notice price difference. The most interesting that Parallels support told that this difference is related to VAT and is determined by my location. But the thing is that VAT in my country is 20%, not 35%.All in all, this looks like a marketing trick or price fraud. And I will have to search for alternatives.-------UPDATE:We've discussed the matter with Parallels Team. It turned out that increase over $99 original price tag is applicable only to non-US customers and is established by Parallel's payment processing partner. Such increase consists of two parts:\u2013 VAT being individually calculated depending on client's location\u2013 Currency conversion fees that are calculated by payment processing partnerThe second item is quite interesting because even if I turn off conversion to my local currency at the checkout, it still shows increased price in USD.And it still looks really unusual when VAT is claimed to be individual across different locations. I've purchased quite a lot of software licenses online and this pricing case looks strange.All in all, my final price is still $135 which makes the product less attractive."

For me, the biggest minus is the fact that permanent version of Parallels Desktop allows you to use just 4 CPU (out of 12 I have on my MacPro) and 8 GB of RAM (out of 128) so I can't use the whole potential of my PC. I know that if I had chosen a one-year subscription I could use the full power of my computer, but I dislike paying for an app every year. I would give it 5 stars if they made a permanent version which would have allowed me to use the whole potential of my computer."

I needed a VM environment on my new iMac using Catalina OS to house an old \"2007 Quicken for Mac\" program in an El Capitan OS.  I did not want to abandon 16 years of data to try to fit into (or misfit) the latest Quicken App.  I found that on the whole, it is doing what I need to continue to add data to the App.  I'm living with some peculiar issues such as that I no longer be able to use Quicken's native backup.  Every time I do, I lose recently entered data.  I conclude after working with Quicken experts that it might be a Quicken problem that they no longer support.  So I just rely on Disk backup on the Mac.  Hoping that is adequate.  Then there is the issue of shutting down Parallels.  I found that if I shut down the VM, I will lose data in Quicken as well.  So I must do no more than  minimize or suspend Parallels, when I turn off the computer.  It give me pause when recently Parallels offers an update.  Should I shut down the VM and risk losing data for the update?  I'm learning to live with the corkiness of the situation.  By the way, their tech support is great, very responsive and knowledgable."

This software is business critical for me, however it completely failed to work. I simply couldn't use it (much too slow, screens not building up, hanging...). So I tried out Parallels and found the perfect seamless integration imaginable. There is simply not any limitation or disadvantage I could think of. It works as if it was a native Mac Os application (fast as any other application, files on my local Mac Os drive, synched to NextCloud, cut & paste between Mac Os and PV*SOL).Important to mention that my comparison between Virtual Box and Parallels relates to the same laptop (as specified above)."

          "Contenu": "It is the only trouble free and working solution to run Windows software on MacOS, amongst alternatives that I have tried. Main purpose is to use OriginLab Origin software on a MacBook Pro or Air. Both have 16 GB RAM 512 GB SSD. I let Parallels decide during installation how much RAM/CPU cores are assigned to the virtual machine. The VM is stable and performance of the Windows software is very decent. Windows is version 11. What I like best is having full access to data on the MAC from the Windows VM, which simplifies data storage and access. On top of that, I can use Mac USB peripheral devices, network etc. from the Windows VM as it were implemented on the Windows VM itself.What I like about Parallels is the reliable upgrade policy and the good support."

          "Contenu": "I needed a Windows virtual machine on my Apple Silicon MacBook Pro, because I needed to run Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio on it.  I tried VMWare Fusion first. It worked, but boy was it a chore to install correctly.  Took a couple of hours.  A co-worker of mine tried Parallels, and he had *SUCH* as easier time of it.  Parallels went and found (and installed!) the correct version of Windows 11 Pro (VMWare made me find it, download it, and install it manually).  Further, using Parallels, you can run Windows programs directly on your Mac desktop, right next to Mac programs. They call it \"coherence mode,\" and you can't even tell that the program is a Windows program running in a virtual machine. It looks like a native Mac app!The last straw for me was when VMWare Fusion wouldn't let me copy/paste something from a Mac app to an app running inside its virtual machine window.  Because apparently it just can't do that.  No clue why.  It just can't.  They even say so in their documentation.  So I uninstalled it and switched to Parallels.  That was a bit over a month ago, and I'm not going back.Parallels also offers you the ability to subscribe to the software annually, if you want \"free\" major-release updates, or you can pay for the software one time, and not get any major-release updates.  I *LIKE* the idea of actually being able to BUY software instead of subscribing to it forever.  Having the option to do either is definitely a plus in my book."

There have been no hiccups when operating; you just use it like any other application, opening and closing as needed.I've used a different platform for Windows on Mac before that required to partition disk space restarting the Macbook in the proper platform every time to be used. That was not convenient at all, especially after using something as easy as Parallels!"

I choose Parallels, because I had to manage some Excel files that cannot be open in Excel Mac native app because some configurations, and now I can open, edit and so much more. About the price, I think it worth it a lot, because I'm no longer seeking for someone to borrow their PC to do some tasks, wasting time during the process."
