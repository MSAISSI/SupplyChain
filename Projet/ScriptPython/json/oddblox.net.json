This was my first time being a \"hoster\", the process was very simple and I had asked if they could add the server files for a Mod Pack we wanted to play and they were more than happy to add them in during the server setup process. All of this took about 10 minutes in total. I am very happy so far with the results!I wanted to post an update as this just happened last night. My brother and I decided to change modpacks and we used the Mod Manager feature for our server. There was an issue with the server files that the mod manager had and it was missing some mods, which caused a mismatch error. I started a chat and was connected with Andrew, he personally helped take a look and trouble shoot the issues we were having. Eventually getting the dev team involved to update the server files and ultimately solving the issue. All in all the issue was resolved in about an hour maybe 2 (I find this very reasonable especially since this was later at night) and my brother and I were able to start playing same day. You guys are doing a great job! Keep it up!!!"

          "Contenu": "I had been using Bisect Hosting to host my modded Minecraft servers for the longest time, since a lot of modpacks have discount codes for that service and I figured it'd be worth a shot to save money--every single server I ran, no matter the modpack, lagged the moment you had 2 or more people online. I bought more RAM for each one and it made no difference; and even as I stripped away the heavier mods it would still often chug. After getting fed up with it on my third time using Bisect, I looked around for other options and saw someone recommend Oddblox on Reddit. Gave them a shot after looking into the alternatives, and I absolutely wish I went to Oddblox sooner. Their prices are just as good, if not cheaper, than Bisect, and I'm able to run a server with 200+ mods and 3-4 of my friends all at the same time with pretty minimal lag. Had a hiccup or two at the very beginning as I was getting used to their control panel, but their support is good and the server itself is fantastic. Highly recommend--until I switched to Oddblox, I thought all modded servers just HAD to lag. Not the case at all."

I have mostly used the 4GB of ram service in either France or the UK and it always runned smoothly, even on 1.19 with a bunch of plugins.There's also a free server that you can get with 2GB of ram and it's great for testing stuff out or making a server with friends.I don't really have any cons.
