Well, as component entertainment systems usually last years this has not and several speakers as well as the receiver have failed on me. While Aperion was once happy to help the product and support have long since been discontinued and now I am left with a half operating, expensive $3,000+ piece of junk. I should have known and will likely never purchase an Aperion Audio product again."

By May of 2015 it was non functional. While speakers were warranted for 10 years, electronics were only warranted for a year. Electronic transmitter went bad. Aperion sold system to us knowing it was going to be discontinued but did not tell us that. When problems occurred they Indicated they would still assist with the electronics mfg. to address malfunctions. Electronics manufacturer discontinued supporting the product. We were offered a paltry $750.00 by Aperion toward a new system, but we would have to return the old system at our own cost. Initially, Aperion's support was very helpful, but once the system was discontinued, the offer for replacement was inadequate as far as we were concerned, especially considering the system must have been known to be unreliable. Aperion took advantage of us as far as we were concerned. Now we have 5 large paper weights too big for a desk! Would not purchase from Aperion again."

I called Aperion for help in repairing the system and was told that they no longer sell or support the system. There was nothing they could do to help with repair or replacement.I did receive advice from the tech support person suggesting that it might be a power issue. He advised me to search for a replacement power cable. I took his advice and fixed the immediate problem but I'm now on notice that when something more serious fails I'll have to replace the entire system, 6 speakers and the amplifier. I don't think I'll be purchasing a replacement from Aperion."

Truth be known, I am a self professed treble guy. If you are like me, with the heightened expectation that these little boxes will cut through, or shatter glass with high frequency you will be dissatisfied. If you taste is tailored towards a very light audiophile accent to compliment your system, than these maybe for you.The market is far from being saturated with a choice of super tweeters, so  in all fairness this was a relatively low cost experiment.James"

I received the product and it had good sound presence, especially in the mid-range.  However, the speakers lack the bass output and the overall sound experience I was looking for.   I then call customer service to ask for a return (RMA) since i had only had the speaker approximately three weeks, but was told that since they were open box, I would have to pay to return them.  Highly disappointed in this return policy.  I guess I will have use Amazon going forward.  Amazon stands behind their return policy whether regular or discounted pricing applies to the merchandise.

          "Contenu": "I loved the quality of the speakers (Versus Grands), but felt that they were a little weak in the bass region, even for 2 channel music listening. I called customer service and their reply was to \"get a subwoofer\" to which I replied \"That is why I purchased these large towers in the first place - not to have a subwoofer\". They were not very cooperative when I wanted to return them either, as I did not have the boxes (they had gotten wet), even though I offered to pay for new boxes to ship them back in. I wound up selling them on e-bay, and loosing a good bit of money. So, not a great experience."

          "Contenu": "First off, the sound of these speakers are fantastic, as is the bluetooth connectivity. What really puts a damper in these speakers however is the fact that they automatically turn off after a few minutes. Having used these speakers for years now I will say that the experience has really been frustrating. Imagine going to the bathroom or going to get the mail then coming back to play something to then notice the speakers are off, then having to find the remote to turn them on because thats the only way they will turn on. Now imagine doing that everyday for 3 years. Its gotten to the point where I just leave something playing while I go make a lunch or some other random task so I don\u2019t have to keep turning on the speakers when I return. All in all, great sound and features but the fact that it always turns off after a few minutes if I\u2019m not playing some sort of sound makes this a hair-pulling product to own. I wouldn\u2019t buy these again."

Did not receive an order confirmation, nor did I receive the speakers.  When I called, it took a while to sort things out...only to be told my order did not get in on time to reserve the available speakers, and it may take months for me to get them.I already had the amp, and paid for it.Someone finally prioritized my order, and they sent me a pair of speakers that had been returned within a few weeks.  The color of the speakers (Cherry) did not match the photos on the website (they were stained a bright red, not natural Cherry colored as in the photos) so we returned them.The sound was o.k., but not natural enough to warrant the jarring aesthetics of the red speakers.  In all fairness, we expected the sound to be lifelike and on par with some fairly high end speakers we tried that were four times the cost."

          "Contenu": "I bought a complete set of speakers from Aperion for a home theatre system I was installing in my home. I bought 2 large front facing speakers for either side of the screen, 4 smaller units to be mounted on the walls at the sides and back of the room, a separate speaker for under the screen and a large amplified speaker for bass sounds.My interaction with the company was very good throughout and I had no problems making my order or getting the speakers. They were shipped very well packaged/protected and were handsome to look at.My issue is that they just didn't sound as good as I was led to believe they would by advertising. I bought these over the internet based on others subjective reviews, but have to admit to being disappointed in this expensive purchase. By the time I was finished adjusting and working with them it was too late to do anything about it.The speakers play well at higher volume but are noticeably anemic when played more softly or at regular levels. The large powered woofer buzzes if left plugged in with the system off and also seems not to be very capable of adding any depth to sound when not played at higher volume. I had to return the first woofer I got for other issues...and this one developed it's own sometime after the warranty expired.I really wanted to like this company and their products...I think they handled all aspects of the sale and delivery quite well...and yet the product itself is as I mentioned before a disappointment."

Odyssey monitors, GamuT amp, MSB DAC) which is room-EQed using Dirac Live DSP and ASI resonators, but the highs were lacking air and presence. The Aperion tweeters are more than easy to integrate, but I needed to choose a higher x-over point to avoid a degradation in uniformity, so 12k/14k was absolutely necessary for my system. Like all good super-tweeters  the ENTIRE frequency range is affected, as we listen to musical overtones and not to HF sine waves. So speaker integration was my priority here, and the outcome was quite good. Matching the goals I had beforehand. I have some IsoAcoustics pucks underneath them. The price is very modest. Very satisfied. As Aperion mentions explicitly, you will need to adjust X-Over freq. (HPF) + attenuation carefully, otherwise you won't be able match them to your speakers well."

          "Contenu": "Bought one piece of \"Aluminum Ribbon Super Tweeter Speaker Pair Gloss Black\" which is a great item to upgrade speakers lacking treble sparkle, resolution and extension (e. g. these with below top-notch grade soft dome tweeters). Highly recommendable! Do a great job on top of my Polk LSiMs.Item was shipped within 24 hours after purchase.My only complaint is poor packaging. Retail box is so damn tiny that speaker front has only 0.57\" air clearance to cardbord from packaging. On rear side where binding posts stick out it's only 0.35\" clearance to cardboard.It was bound to happen mine were hit centrically at one speaker's leading edge by intrusion in transit, resulting in minor dent visible. As I am not a nitpicking guy it's still O.K. to me. But it could be avoided by using larger foamed inserts and just a little bigger retail box. These sit too close to cardbord in their packaging, at least with their unprotected middle of cabinets."

When I went to use it recently it had no output.  I carefully reviewed the owner's manual to no avail.  I called Aperion on two occasions and spoke to two different employees there, Steve being one.  They were very patient, responsive, and helpful.  The problem couldn't be solved over the phone.  I ended up taking the speaker to them where they ran tests and determined the amp was not working.  They could not repair it due to parts unavailability.  In the big picture I was disappointed that the sub failed with so little use and good care.  I was also disappointed that they could not repair their own product.  I can't say I'm happy with the product, but I am very pleased with their customer service and attitude.  I would purchase another product from them.  I found a terrific old school stereo repair shop near Aperion and I believe they can repair my unit."

They provided expert advice based on a solid understanding of acoustics and also what their products capabilities are. We went through several ideas and figured out a 5.2.4 layout that worked. We leveraged the A5 immersive height modules for ceiling speakers, bipole speakers for surrounds. I had some legacy Verus towers I was gifted that needed some TLC and they did a perfect repair! The center channel we used the Verus Grand V6C. After some equalization settings work, it\u2019s dialed in. Perfect!"

I can't recommend Aperion enough. My old speakers continue to produce incredibly accurate sound and the new ones are just as good.

Aperion was a very highly rated brand.  Come to find out it was direct-to-consumer only.  No middle men.  With that, you get very high quality speakers at 30-40% the cost of similar competition.  The workmanship of these speakers is second to none.  All of my speakers have the cherry finish and are stunning.  Aperion manufactures top end speakers, well designed, well constructed and excellent sounding, at an affordable price.  Aperion is definitely an American success story!  Do business with them.  You'll be happy about your decision!"

          "Contenu": "First let me say the packaging is excellent and well above average compared to mainstream brands at these price levels.  The attention to safe packaging cannot be overstated - I've received $3,000 speakers where the packaging is blown to bits and unusable a second time - not the case with Aperion Audio Novus I received.Fit-N-Finish: Top marks for visual finish, design and build quality.  The N6T's are even more handsome in person.  I love the unique reflex slotted port as well as the subtle baffle slope. Bass driver quality is good, crossover parts are above average in this category.  You will not find ceramic resistors in oversees designs at this price level.  The grills are impressive as are the many fine details of a $1700 speaker. Sound: I give the N6T top marks as a dynamic, punchy and well sorted micro detail speaker for movies.  For music, the Novus are cut from the typical American sound profile, lots of hard rocking bass, extra leading edge detail for your brass and symbols, yet a little too light in the vocal department.  Think Hans Zimmer Film Scores - the Novus are up to the task with full range movie scape sound.  You will want a very strong tube amp or high quality class A/B amp that promotes midrange warmth to extract the very best from your N6T's.  *Use thick copper speaker cables, avoid silver cables, the N6T need no assistance with upper treble energy.  Aperion Audio speakers should last you many trouble free years."

Then I received updates about shipping directly as well. On to the speakers. I have a 5.2.4 setup now with the recent Aperion tower and bookshelf purchase. They were packaged very nice. I'll save the boxes for moves in the future. The sound with my Denon AVR and the auto set up is very clean and nice sounding.

Speakers are still great but the remote was having some issues (normal wear and tear, although it is very tough, the internals are not as tough, specifically the LED which stopped working and hence my speakers couldn't be used anymore; no universal remote available for these beauties, and there are no buttons to push on the speakers either).    The sale experience for the replacement remote was flawless.  I talked directly to Collin Lybarger who is always friendly and helpful, so everything worked out nicely.   Got my new remote and now I'm again enjoying these incredible speakers."

          "Contenu": "I bought my first set of Aperion speakers 11 years ago. They have been wonderful speakers for that entire time. But when the Verus III V8T concert Towers reviews came out a couple years back, I started saving my pennies. I purchased the Verus Towers, Surrounds and Center channel and the 12 inch woofer. To say that it was an Epiphany in my musical listening experience would be an understatement. honestly, I have never heard imaging this detailed.  Once I got them dialed in, I was literally transported to the studio with the performers standing right in front of me singing to me. Not all recordings are made equal of course, but every recording that I\u2019ve listened to sounds great, and the best are almost unbelievable in their clarity. While they certainly are not cheap. I can honestly say that for this price point I can\u2019t imagine any speaker being better. I am running them through an Onkyo RZ \u2013 950 receiver, which I am now just using as a pre/pro. As I also purchased the new E5 amplifier, and am powering the four height modules (Atmos) with the Emotiva Basx four channel amplifier. Again, absolutely stunning. Oh, and they look incredible as well. I would encourage anyone who is looking to spend a reasonable amount on speakers to look at the Aperion first before anything else. I can\u2019t imagine wanting a different speaker in this price range. Aperion my hat is off to you! And thank you for the gift of me falling in love with music once again!!"

Customer service is superb, really aiming to please the client. And the sound of the Silver cables coupled with my Focal Elegia's/Astell and Kearns player is very difficult to tear myself away from because of their musicality, incredible detail and stage-like imaging."
