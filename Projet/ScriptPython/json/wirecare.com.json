The coupler was for a baler wiring harness that runs the bale monitor.  She paid $30 and about $3 in shipping.

          "Contenu": "Purchased several items from WireCare.com on 12/15/21 which the website stated they were all in stock! On 12/16/2021 at 1:20pm cst I received an email from customer service stating that not all of the items I ordered were in stock and that the item(s) would be in stock approximately 1-1.5 months and that the remaining items would be shipped out then! Six (6) minutes later (I repeat 6 minutes later) I got a shipping notification! I responded to their email on 12/16/21 at 8:49pm stating I wanted to completely cancel my order if the order wasn\u2019t complete. It should be noted that as of the morning of 12/17/2021 the item had not left their facility and wasn\u2019t in the shipping companies possession due to the shipping log & and the date and time stamp when the shipping label was created. I received a emailed back from WireCare 12/17/2021 at 7:58am stating that the items had already shipped yesterday (complete & utter BS). This is absolutely terrible customer service!!! First, the quality on hand should be correct in your inventory, no where on the website did it state that the item(s) were on back order. Secondly, 6 minutes to respond to an email so I can cancel my whole order is not sufficient time whatsoever and why didn\u2019t the company give me a call since it was a required field during checkout\u2026.? Third, why the heck would I want half my order\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t have ordered the items if I didn\u2019t need them! Lastly, when I asked to completely cancel my order before it had shipped the company canceled my back order item(s) and refund me for those items (which I never requested) I asked for  the whole order to be canceled and not shipped! This company is a complete joke. I do not recommend this company to anyone! I will be using Digi-Key for all of my purchases and at about half the price for the same items! WireCare of course stated I could return the items for a complete refund but I guess they don\u2019t understand time =money! I would waste more money in postage, gas and payroll to have one of my employees ship the item back. First time using this company and absolutely the last time!"

After I paid for the purchases and delivery (not cheap), after a while they wrote to me in the mail that some goods were out of stock and some of the money would be returned to me on the card. In a letter, I asked the seller to wait with the shipment while I revise the configuration of the goods I need based on what is in stock. But the seller never answered my mail. And I sent the item with the missing items from the cart and returned the difference to the card. As a result, I did not spend quite efficiently on delivery, and did not update the cart based on the availability of goods."

I ordered MPAO .75 BK with adhesive, but what I received was MPNO.75 BK no adhesive backing  But after calling and leaving messages to correct the problem to date I have still not received a call back so that I can get the issue resolved. at which time I will be happy to edit my review to reflect the solution reached'  ***** I need to mention that I have ordered in the past and have never had any complaints with the product or the services so I am hoping the this is a simple issue with the operations due to Covid changes in operations and will be resolved to everyone's satisfaction"

Instead I got an email after placing my order saying that certain parts were backordered and would be sent 2 or 3 months later. This is pretty bad because I placed orders with two other vendors at the same time, incurring rush shipping charges with each of them. Had I known Wirecare wouldn't deliver, I could have found the backordered parts on other sites. Instead I had to pay yet more rush charges to place additional orders for the parts Wirecare missed.I like Wirecare's usability and detail. Prices are often 50% above those of competitors, which when I placed my order I assumed was because it kept all listed parts in stock. I was willing to pay a premium for that, but paying a premium doesn't make sense when parts are out of stock and not identified as such. Fix the interaction between the inventory system and the web site and customers won't get disappointed like me!"

          "Contenu": "My company was in need of a new cable gun kit. I sourced them from multiple vendors and saw that you were the only one that did not have a shipment disclaimer on the product page. I called first to request a price match, as your unit is $700 more than all of the other vendors, including DMC. I was told that you do not offer price matching, but the unit would be received into your facility on Monday 12/30. I thought, Time is money so I might as well go ahead and get this unit since I do not have to wait. I received tracking a few days later for a single part of my order. Once the unit received I initiated a chat with Wire Care and requested an update only to be told that the unit was ordered from DMC and usually takes about 4-6 weeks to process through them before even shipping to me. If I knew this ahead of time I would have just purchased the unit from another vendor for the lower amount. Feels a bit bait and switchy in my opinion. I did request that the amount be credited but was told that since the margins were so thin on this unit that was not a possibility.I find it hard to believe that someone who has a relationship with Daniels would not have a better discount than what they list on their own website to consumers. Edited 1/7/2020I would like to add that the wire care team reached out and advised of the miscommunication issue. I appreciate their professionalism on this matter and their method for handling our concerns."

There is no way to tell this from your website. In fact your website is hard to match components as you have to scroll and guess, then read all the specs, and roll the dice to see if they work. So those 8 items pin and sockets were a waste of money as well as the crimper I bought to try and make them work. Didn't even try because the plug and receptacle were so obviously off. Edit-improved review based on incorrect info in original review. Other than this inconvenience and doubling the cost of my order, the components seem like good quality. The deutsch connectors work much better than the weather-tech connectors I previously used and they are rated for more current which could not be done with the other ones. Update: customer service reached out and refunded me for the incorrect components. Also, they pointed out they have a page on their website that can match the various components to your task. Thanks for the help. Review improved accordingly."

I was outraged to say the least at the charge for shipping and handling, especially since what I ordered didn\u2019t even total 1 lb. I contacted the company thinking I was not going to get a response, and to my total surprise I got a prompt response from Steve Crane, Sales Manager, informing me that he was going to correct the mistake. Really nice guy to work with! I only gave them 4 stars because of the error in billing, but over all I would definitely order from them again."

Well it's my fault cuz the measuring is too confusing I thought that the sizes indicated should measure in width but no, it should measure in diameter. I hope they create a easier way to find out the correct size of what the customer want. I also ordered techflex, good thing there's no problem on that. Kudos to that!People in Wirecare are very nice, I thought in the first place I'm talking to the chat bot only lol, they all answer my questions very well. Thanks to the people who I talked with! Will definitely gonna order here again soon :)"

And for that reason I still have faith. And for what its worth, the item that did ship looks great.

I wanted to amend this review, specially after Michelle reached out to me personally to address my issue, and offered to send a replacement. It is rare that you find such personal attention in customer service these days. The order was not a large order and very little money was involved, yet they still took the time to make it right. I will continue to do business with Wire Care in the future and I give them the highest recomendation"
