It has now been months and no estimate, no reply back, no answers and winter is knocking at the door. Used to be a top notch company so very disappointed and not quite sure why unable to get an estimate to replace duct work."

Additionally, they gave me a quote on a new A//C unit and heater system. It's not cheap but they did show me several payment options. My only issue is the fact that they charge a service call charge, then the A/C unit service charge and then a charge for driving to my house which is 19 miles from their office in Sydney. The total charge to service my A/C was $347. After calling a few other companies, two of which were in Scottsbluff, NE. Which is much further away and their quotes were less. And they don't charge to drive out."
