Our UPS account has a shipment release authorization but it says not available due to shipper restrictions. We then tried to have it held for pickup at a access point but that too is restricted by the shipper. We then called Strobes and More and they told us we have to wait home all day for UPS. We have never had this issue with anyone else for such a small order, $1,100. We will never be ordering from Strobes and More again."

They then try to blame it on UPSAs you can see they have no intelligent response. I've reported these thieves to multiple agencies as well as the attorney General. They are theives. Trustpilot said my review was to harsh but reality is they stole my money and refuse to deliver my items. I stand by my statement and hereby add attachments.I swear to GOD these are the dumbest ppl on the planet I have been arguing with them on order number 260825. They lied to me several times. They lost my order and then tried to make every excuse even blaming me for it. I promise you I have never in my existence encountered a more pathetic company in my life. I would rather eat rat crap the rest of my life then to deal with these uneducated morons."

Had one of their tailgators catch fire while still under warranty, had some difficulty finding a shipping tube to send it back in with. Recommended it to a friend because other than this one which I felt to be defective, I love the product. Ended up using the shipping tube theirs came in to return mine. By that point it was a few months out of warranty, I had documentation proving the event of it failing and catching fire occurred prior to the warranty ending and was declined warranty coverage on a replacement due to it being out of warranty by the time they received it.*in reply to their reply* I\u2019m not sure how 2 am being the time this shows it was posted has relevance however 1. It was done about midnight but between time zone difference and there being a delay in reviews posting it appeared to be later. 2. I think it\u2019s a given that first responders keep odd hours and I posted that before bed after having been busy all day.Also I emailed Lauren back in April asking that it be reconsidered after having talked on the phone including a picture of the product that was damaged that also included a time stamp from when it was still in warranty and never received a reply. This email also included a order number.In regards to the fuse it did blow after catching fire but regardless of that the product failed while under warranty and isn\u2019t being replaced as if it were, that\u2019s where my concern lies."

What a great business...NOT   I do not recommend doing business with this company at all!!!"

I'm not sure how you can make this not happen again, but I probably will not purchase anymore lights from your company in the future. Our emergency light salesman is no longer in business and I was hopeful that your company would be the replacement. I obviously was wrong. Thank you for your time, and I still have not received my light. I guess my business and future business with you doesn't mean anything to you all."

I called the company and they told me that they needed additional information about my vehicle, so it was going to be another 4 more weeks before I would receive it. I asked them why they didn't communicate that before now. They said that they did try to call but I never received the call or message. I told them that I wanted to just cancel the order because I was going to use another company that could get it for me a lot sooner. Unfortunately, they told me that they couldn't refund my money. I had already placed the order and because it was a \"special order\" they wouldn't be able to give me a refund. How convenient, they hadn't started my order because they \"needed additional information\" but they sure could keep my money because it was a \"special order\"?!?! I will never use this company again."

They should have taken care of their customer while working out the separate issue with UPS.  I paid for 3 day shipping too.Here's the best part, I called asking about my order, was transferred to Dave, as he was working the claim with UPS.  Besides telling me \"i don't know why they transferred you to me\", He told me that they would not ship out my order until they work out the claim with UPS.So they have a customer order and paid for a product.  It gets damaged before ever delivered to the customer, and the customer will not get the product because of an issue Strobesnmore has with UPS.  I canceled the order and will go to a company that knows how to treat a customer."

          "Contenu": "While the product seems fine, I was disappointed by the fairly draconian return restrictions. I ordered a light bar that ended up being an inch too wide. My installer, a former police officer and fire department chief (I point this out because he is a reliable, honorable person I trust), who recommends your company all the time, made the mistake when pulling it out of the box of cutting the zip tie holding the wires together, only to find that the bar was too long. He then simply placed it right back in the box. In returning it, was basically implied that I was lying in saying that no power had been applied to the bar, and it had not actually been installed in any way. To top that off, I paid for the bar, plus shipping. I returned it, paying for shipping, and then when I was told it was refused, not only did I have to pay for shipping BACK to me, but a $25 fee was added on top. This all seems like just a way to get more money out of people. I agree with paying for the shipping, but was the extra fee really necessary? I have already ordered other items (and fear any cancellation will incur more draconian fees) but once I receive this final order I will not be ordering from the company again. I only give two stars because the product is good, but management needs to look closely as to if they care to build long term business with customers, or adhere to rules, and charge unwarranted fees, to make an extra buck."

I have a screenshot of their website as of this morning that shows backorder status for the lights I actually received but I guess they don't check their own website. Ordered two different types of lights.  One showed to be on backorder, other did not.  I sent an email prior to ordering and was told I could go ahead and place the order and they'd ship them when they came in.  I paid, got a receipt, and then got a shipment notice.  Ended up receiving the lights that were listed as a backorder on the website, and not the ones that did not show as a backorder.  No one contacted me to let me know about any type of short shipment.  Following the directions on the box, I emailed customer service.I told them the lights that were showing as in stock (if you're showing backorder on one I assume the other is in stock) did not ship but the ones showing backordered did.  I got an argumentative response saying that your website did not show stock and the lights were 4 to 6 weeks out.The lights I DID receive are great.  I expected to have to wait on SOMETHING, so even that isn't an issue.  Had the shipment been short and someone communicated that, it would have been a 5 star rating.  Had the shipment been short and I got an update that wasn't argumentative, 4 stars just for me having to ask where the other lights were.  The quality of the lights and the value are why it's still at 3  stars and not lower.I would still recommend the company, just understand that you may or may not get what you ordered and customer service isn't going to tell you anything until you ask."

I give the products ordered a 5 star rating, I give the response from the company a 5 star, however when I received the initial items there was no paperwork showing what was being delivered and what was backordered.

Being that I wash my truck once per week, that will mean that I will most likely always have a condensation issue and it detracts from the appearance of the product. I\u2019ve never had this issue with any other light bar I\u2019ve owned. While the light is impressive in function it is subpar in design and production."

It turns out that they are the same but all of the messages I left with Strobes and More went unanswered and I had to figure this all out on my own.  So I went online and found the same thing, one terrible 2 MINUTE video that didn't explain anything and and just showed clips of some guy plugging stuff in with much explanation or close up shots of the panels.   Once I had it installed, 8 hours later, It all worked great and I'm impressed with the quality of the product, BUT, COME ON GUYS this is the world of Youtube, pull your head out and make a decent video."

Initially they calculated $17 shipping  ( UPS ground ) from Rhode Island to NJ, on a switch I was ordering which was under $20, and maybe a 1/4 pound in weight!  After contacting customer service I received a \u201cship free\u201d code to apply to the item at checkout.  There were also no updates on the package or tracking number tied to my email.  I work on the road quite a bit and find the arrival information vital, especially when the item ordered is holding up the installation of a warning light beacon.  The problem is most of us are use to dealing with Amazon which almost gives too much \u201cupdate\u201d information.  The item was packaged well and in pristine shape.  Other than the shipping policy, I like the products Strobes and More sells.  Hope this helps"

I purchased a Havis console over the phone during which time I gave the customer service representative the type of radio, siren, Etc. that was supposed to get mounted.  She looked up the bracket numbers advising me the brackets should fit the application.  When I received the console, only one of the three brackets were correct.  When I called customer service, I was told they could not do anything about it that I would have to purchase the correct brackets for approx. 40.00. (AFTER JUST SPENDING 400.00 ON IT) I than explained that I was not that one who gave them incorrect part numbers and the 400.00 console I just purchased will not work with the brackets I was given.  I was than told I would have to contact Havis to resolve the issue.  I did contact Havis and they sent me the correct brackets and extra filler plates at no charge.  What really disappoints me the most is that I just recently spent SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS with Strobes N More equipping two vehicles with lights, sirens and other equipment."

Bought them weeks ago and no one thought to follow up with me after spending close to $200 on their site that my products are not available, thats so inconsiderate of the customer. They offered to send me different brand products for the sold out ones which was an acceptable solution, but the entire process to reach this solution will make me make sure I do not buy anything of greater value like I did again, just ridiculous that with the amount of money i spent no one thought to inform me about the status of my order at any point time, have used SNM one other time and had a great experience, this time around not so much.

When I had a issue with one of my Slivers, they sent me a replacement, as to their 5 yr warranty, unfortunately they sent me a updated Sliver II model that would not work with my other 3 Sliver lights, forcing me to purchase 3 more Sliver II's. When I asked if they would discount the others because I was forced to purchase them, they refused. After having the Sliver II's in my vehicle for 2 months, I had a issue with 2 of the new Sliver II's. After sending them back, they told me nothing was wrong with them and sent them back to me. After rewiring my truck and putting them back in, as per Strobes n More, they still didnt work properly. Calling back again and sending them back, they stated nothing was wrong with them. They finally, after me sending 2 more back, they replaced 2 of the Sliver II's with E6 Slims and discounted 2 other E6 Slims for me. My complaint is I had to do all the labor and time to install and uninstall these lights multiple times. Imagine if I had to pay someone to do all that labor??? It would have costed me a arm and leg!! Also I am out of a lot of money with Sliver and Sliver II's I am not using. Thank god the different person I talked to the 3rd time gave me 2 E6 Slims for free as a warranty and a discounted price to purchase 2 more E6 Slims. I believe they had a issue with the Sliver lights because they are discontinued now, and being replaced with the E6 Slims."

          "Contenu": "I bought the E beacon lights for my truck. I work in the asphalt business therefore I spend my days in the road. Though these lights are on the more affordable end. Because they were made by strobesnmore I assumed nothing but the best. I\u2019ve been extremely happy with every other product I\u2019ve purchased but sadly these lights were sub par. They cannot be seen on sunny days which didn\u2019t work for me. I\u2019m not knowledgeable on the differences of classes of lights but these ones just aren\u2019t bright. I contacted strobesnmore. They offered to have me send them in to look at them to make sure they were working properly. I can\u2019t go without lights. Asked to replace them or exchange for a better light and I\u2019d be happy to pay the difference. The owner of strobesnmore sadly wouldn\u2019t help with any of that and from there I haven\u2019t heard back since. So my advice would be to really know what your buying before making the purchase. Unfortunately due to this situation I will not be making anymore purchases with strobesnmore. They make false claims like this reply below that they tested my lights. I sure don\u2019t remember sending my lights that I purchased from you in for you to test them? When did that happen? What good would testing any other light than the ones on my truck? Why would you want to resell these sub par lights to someone else anyways? Why is it my fault you sold me these lights that don\u2019t serve the purpose? Like I said make sure you know what your buying before you purchase from strobesnmore because this is what you deal with if it doesn\u2019t work properly or perform to proper standards. What a nightmare, I\u2019ve wasted more time than it\u2019s worth on this. Bought new Whelen beacons and won\u2019t have to worry again. My complaint was they were dim and couldn\u2019t be seen in the daylight. Did you test my lights or ones you had there? There\u2019s no sense in wasting time with this and going back and forth. It\u2019s my fault for not not testing each one before I brought them to be installed I guess. Guess it\u2019s my fault I bought them and I\u2019m not happy with them. Just would of expected a better outcome. Hence why I say to make sure you know what your getting from strobesnmore before you have them installed. Have a nice day."

          "Contenu": "I placed a order within the last 2 weeks.  The turn around time was spot on and the order shipped out to me quickly.  If I could rate only the products availability and getting my order fast it would be a 5 star scored review.However, that is not the case.  The online strobes n more website offers online chat.  The chat/service/answering questions and overall attitude of the rep via chat is useless. I was browsing the site on several different occasions compiling my order.  I had a few questions to be clear on some products, compatibility etc..  I always got the same female by the name of Sarah.  Sarah was not just unfriendly every single encounter with short 1 or 2 word responses but mid first question she vanishes.  She then almost answered 1 question then silence again for 10 + mins.  It\u2019s always bad service when a customer is trying to spend their money yet receives a rep that is in and out of the conversation with no explanation as to why.  It\u2019s obvious she is distracted by something else.  Once in dialogue with a customer on chat It should be treated just as I was on the phone speaking to her.  Unfortunately this is not the case.  In chat going over some products and she goes silent.  I am literally saying \u201cHello? Can I get some help with my order please?\u201d  More silence then a \u201cTech\u201d? person chimes in to tell me that Sarah answered the phone from a customer\u201d(??)  However, I am a new customer trying to put a order together to place right then and I even said that.  So I got bypassed by the phone?  I do not understand why a chat box automatically pops up on the website offering to help you but you get dropped if the phone rings?  This is a huge waste of time for the customer.  I needed about 7 items on my initial first order of many to come.  I patiently waited a good 30 minutes needing some answers prior to placing a order.  Sarah never came back, no follow up message, nothing at all.  I was over it so I picked a product I was familiar with and purchased that item only.  The customer service rep was too busy to help me even though I was chatting with her before the phone rang from someone else.  I am very understanding if employees are only 1 or 2 at the phones and chat.  Most customer service reps would apologize with a brief explanation of their situation.  Also giving some idea of when they could help you.  Perhaps she would suggest to call me.  Sarah just vanishes without a word.  Long story short I purchased the one item for $300+ and went to another dealer who knows how important good service is.  He helped me right away, good attitude, very informative, took his time to answer any questions and he gave advice on how to make things run smoothly.  It took less than 30 minutes.  I was not dropped for another customer, ignored, no vanishing acts or any of that method of treating customers.  I have since made 4 purchases with that same competitor with no issues at all.  I possibly may buy another product again from strobes but It would have to be a product I know well.  However, if I get Sarah I will not waste any more of my time like I have already."

          "Contenu": "I used their gear primarily to retrofit a partially de-commissioned CVPI for security work. The hide away strobes were easy to install and are very bright. I do not know if the supplied gaskets keep out moisture, they are a cushion type material not rubber. There is some fogging in both headlight lens that was not there before the install. It should be noted, I used new OEM replacement headlights for the install. If you are running the control boxes in the trunk you have to buy an inordinate amount of extensions (8) at 9 bucks a pop to make it work. I had to get one extension to just outfit four hide aways in the rear reflector assembly and tailights, for a control box ALSO located in the trunk, which is ridiculous. The base set of wiring for each strobe should be 12 feet at least. This change would have eliminated half my extension purchases. The extensions have a nice shielded (easy to pull) individually wrapped hot and ground wire with a proprietary connection link. The shadow siren/light controller is fantastic and does a lot at its price point. I have divided the lights up on the supplied four switches A. rear (4 hideaways), B. Front (4 hideaways), C. (front amber x2 in grill), D. red/blue front grill. Siren tones are crisp and the PA function is clear through the siren that came on the vehicle. The remote function on the Shadow allows you to mount the control box out of the way in the trunk. You can then run the supplied (16 ft) RJ11 to the driver's seat where you plug in the handset. The handset itself is made with thin plastic, so I do not know how durable it is. I did not see replacement handsets on sale. You may need one during the life of the unit. Since the handset is so thin, I am scared to try to use the magnetic mic holder I got from SandM for fear of drilling into a vital component and voiding the warranty. I called their tech guys with a question regarding the 2 power inputs into the siren controller, and if they could be hard wired from one line from the battery. When pulling the wires back I had not anticipated needing 2 power lines to power one controller. Maybe it is necessary if you are running 2 sirens or siren/growler. Only one of the power inputs has a fuse on the line and BOTH should come with a fuse in a plastic housing based on that conversation. In all great customer service and tech support."

I docked it one star as there are no on/off indicators to let you know if one circuit is left on in daylight.

The videos they post are top notch, and give a great example on what the products (lights) can do. My only complaint is that they do not show the amount and type of wiring enough that a person has to do to get the products working correctly. For example, I recently bought a group of switches for an arrow light bar. The diagram on line only showed the basic wiring, so I had trouble figuring out which wire went where. Obviously red is positive, black is negative; but when all the wires are red, then what? After awhile of figuring it out, I got the light to work. It was just the agitation that I had to go through."

I had to apply blue-tint vinyl wrap to get a decent blue color out of it, which makes it less bright (though it's still pretty bright, just not as bright as it could be).I assume the other colors do NOT suffer from the same color wash-out issue -- I've noticed across multiple manufacturers that blue is the most difficult to get right.At some point, I'll probably pick up the amber to replace my front and / or rear motorcycle turn signals."

That's perfect for a response mode and then just to have color on scene. I also did purchase the extra led lights because I will mount them either on the side of the grille guard or possibly in my headlights and thanks to the simplicity of the plug in style for the extra lights, it's so much easier now. I highly recommend this light!"

Other than that I'm happy with my purchase. Would like to make a suggestion though... I needed to extend the light bar power cord a full 12ft to work on a 2012 RAM Laramie mounted on a \"BackRack\".... I made my own wire loom (soldered and heat shrink connections), maybe you could offer as a service to extend the light bars power cord... looking forward to the next purchase... Will also consider purchase the multi strand wire from you next time...highly recommend the E6 Dual Color and Millinion Mini Light Bar! Especially for primary lighting."

I use amber emergency warning lighting on my vehicles for the simple fact that I carry tools and stop to help motorists in need of help but don't want to get killed doing it. I use Strobes-N-More products on our work vehicles also for warning lighting. Just one example is a pair of E-6's that I put on the rear of my old company pick up truck cap. I received a newer company pick up truck three times now but that old Silverado with the E-6's is still in service. Those E-6's were disconnected for a while. I hooked up 12v power and a toggle switch and they still work just fine. They've been on the back of that truck cap as surface mount rear facing (Amber) warning lights for at least six years and we're still using them.Customer Service at Strobes-N-More gets a five star rating also. Not once have I called them and not spoken to someone that made sure that my question was answered before I hung up with them. They're the kind of people that you would feel comfortable just stopping in and saying hi if you were in R.I.If you have a business with vehicles that stop or stay on the side of the road (like landscaping vehicles), Strobes-N-More is the place to shop for affordable warning lighting.Thanks for listening,Joseph YuodisTolland County in Connecticut"
