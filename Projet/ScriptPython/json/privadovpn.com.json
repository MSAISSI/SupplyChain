I and my expat neighbors use VPNS and they tend to take my lead.So as you may see they replied to please reach out to them because they don't recognize my email address in spite of the review request going to my email. I responded by opening another ticket and pasting the communications in there.I just now received an automated response from the ticket created yesterday. They say its been awhile since they've heard from me.

Marketing bombardment; a labyrinthine site that always seems to end up on the upgrade page, whatever your status as a user; oh, and a friendly \"we know where you live\" map of your house when you try to cancel (for which you have to fill in a lengthy form only for them to email you a public but impossible-to-find link to a subpage of the site).I signed up to be able to watch streaming services (I doubt the Russian and Chinese journalists who actually make valuable use of VPNs have the time to tolerate the incessant marketing from a company like Privado), and the playback was nice and snappy during the free trial. Of course, with 2023 data rates, the 10GB was exhausted within 3 hours, so after following the link to \"Activate Limited Speed\" (supposed to be available after the full-speed data is used), which lo, dumped me on the upgrade page, they got what they wanted and I signed up for a premium month. I cancelled immediately (the subscription autorenews after a month and there is no option to choose for it not to), and then began the slowdowns. Sites that previously streamed smoothly now require reduced quality settings, reproduced after several reboots of the VPN.I suggest looking elsewhere."

Yet, they are trying to get this review removed unless I provide them with further details which I promptly did.I tested the free version and everything worked fine so I purchased the annual plan.For the first 6 months I literally had zero issues then after the most recent update (3.5) the vpn no longer masks IP ( I suppose ).As a consequence I cannot stream on vidio.com as I used to do just a week ago before that update.I contacted support and they replied very promptly even if was Saturday evening.They asked me a whole lot of data and details and after that replied giving me a list of their protocols and telling me to choose one of them instead of letting privado choose automatically.Mind you, they DID NOT advise which one/s would be a better choice they just told me to change it.I tested 3 different protocols with 3 different browsers but I was still being geo blocked.I contacted them again asking, for the second time, to be refunded and letting them know that my service was working fine before the update with the exact same browser, extensions etc.They replied back telling me to try different browsers and clear cache/cookies (which I had already done ) and intentionally ignoring my refund request.I then replied explaining that I use the most secure browser available and that my history, cache and cookies are cleaned on exit.For the THIRD TIME I asked to be refunded.Their most recent reply so far was a bunch of things I needed to reset, change, and try. They told me, AGAIN, that if issues persisted they would investigate further.AND AGAIN they deliberately ignored my refund request. No mention about it.  ZERO.I feel absolutely cheated upon with no ways to talk to anyone on their part who would actually give me my money back.They take your money but when problems arise they do not give it back to you, even if it's entirely their fault.My advice is: STAY AWAY.P.S before anyone tries the \"we could not locate your account\" or other ways to discredit this review this is the ticket number#PRV00151639And I could paste the emails if necessary...EDIT AFTER PRIVADO'S REPLYExactly what I said.\"Our service does not prohibit the viewing of said website, however, we are aware that some sites and services have implemented measures that would prevent their content from being viewed while connecting to our VPN\"Update or not your service is NOT delivering what promised. I, as a paying customer, have paid 12 months in advance for a service that I am not receiving.And you, being the deceiving and dishonest company you are, won't offer any refund or compensation even if, per your own admission, your VPN is not doing what a VPN is supposed to.\"Unfortunately, due to the amount of time that has passed, your account is no longer eligible for a refund as outlined in our Terms of Service: https:// privadovpn.com /terms-of-service/\"You just protected yourself by adding another deceiving bit to your TOS and hiding behind it whilst it's obvious that I am not asking a refund because I want to cancel my account but because I paid for something I am no longer benefitting from.\"You can cancel further billing charges by logging into the admin-panel ( edited because tp does not allow links in reviews ) and clicking the cancel button at the bottom of the page.\"THIS IS ANOTHER LIE.There are NO BUTTONS at the bottom of any page thanks to which you can cancel your next billing cycle by keeping the current account active.THE ONLY way to cancel the billing cycle is to cancel the entire account and lose the ability to use the vpn service for the remaining months I have already paid for.You are absolutely shameless.At least everyone here on trustpilot will see, thanks to your own words, the type of company you are."

First it was the cheapest. Although I knew it didn't have all the bells and whistles as some of the other big names, all I cared about was speed and privacy. The second was because of reviews that speeds didn't change that much. After the purchase and testing it out for a few days I found out I was disappointed. I only find one server in the entire list to be in green, most are in red and some in yellow. I find the speeds are so much slower than expected, about 1/20th of my normal speed. I hope these issues can be fixed very soon or I will have to find a way to cancel my subscription. I don't even know if I have a 45 days trial period or not."

There is no information on your website about cancelling, not even on the Support section, apart from a very misleading answer on your FAQ about cancelling through third party websites, which doesn\u2019t apply to most people. After much digging on My Account, I finally saw a pale gray, almost white Cancel Subscription button at the very bottom of the Billing page. All in all, it took me about half an hour to cancel my subscription due to your deceiving practices. This is very sneaky and almost unethical. Because of this, I will not be using your services again in the future. Thank you."

          "Contenu": "I subscribed to PrivadoVPN several months ago. Despite not being able to use the kill switch (which immediately disconnects me from the internet), I was pleased with PrivadoVPN. (And no, \"support\" did not give me a solution to this.) So I use it without the kill switch being activated. The download speed is approximately the same as I receive from my ISP.Then they recently notified me of an \"upgrade\" which is basically support for Russian and Chinese. I do NOT want to \"upgrade.\" I sent support@privadovpn the following:I use privado vpn on two Win 10 computers. Every time I turn on the computers, I get the upgrade nag screen. I don't want to upgrade--I don't want Russian, China, etc. How can I keep this annoying nag screen from popping up every time? I click \"remind me later\" but that doesn't do any good either.The first response was that no, I am not able to stop the nag popup. Then a second response was: \"If you prefer not to install the update with the extended language support, please visit Privado app's Settings > Application > and under \"Update automatically\" , remove the green tick.\"That \"solution\" didn't work.I am NOT PLEASED that can't opt out of the nagging me to \"upgrade.\" Please, PrivadoVPN, do not post the canned response that you send everyone else...\"we're sorry, etc., contact us...\" I have already contacted support.Update on 8/17/23 - Trustpilot notified me that PrivadoVPN wanted information \"about my account\" or my review would be removed within 3 days. I did send the information. Then PrivadoVPN's response was that no, I can't get rid of the nag screen every time I try to log in. \" the screen offering an update will still appear, unfortunately.\" (\"Offering? No, demanding.)The \"team\" recommends installing the update--which includes Russian and Chinese. They say, \"Even if you decline this current update, there will be more languages available soon; with the next updates, there will be French and Dutch added along with multiple other languages.\"I do NOT want Russian, Chinese, or any language except English. I am very unhappy that PrivadoVPN does not give me the freedom to avoid their intrusive, annoying nag screen in order to log in.They offered to give me an additional free month to my subscription. Big deal.Next update: Please, PrivadoVPN, just leave me alone! The kill switch issue is the least of my issues with PrivadoVPN. I don't want your \"upgrades,\" I want the nag screen eliminated, and I am even more annoyed to keep getting your repeated unhelpful emails and messages."

          "Contenu": "This is an unpaid review from a first time VPN user. PrivadoVPN is awesome. It has a great price (watch for deals), never drops, and is incredibly stable and low latency. I use it on a PC for competitive twitch games and the total latency to servers is under 50 ms, which is within 10 ms of my normal so that's fine. It doesn't throttle ever on large downloads or long play times. Totally smooth. It has a ton of nice features like socks5, and it has a clean phone app where you just click one button to VPN connect."

It's 5 stars and more."

Because stupid Shaw Bluecurve does not allow loopback and there is no way to enable it, we couldn't move between our cluster. People outside our network had no problems. Suggested action was to use a VPN - Privado's 10GB did the trick very nicely. The only annoying bit was having to enable and disable it each time we swapped servers...so we went ahead and paid for two years. Now, I just leave the VPN running while I play - game still runs smoothly with no lag while on the VPN. I'm happy!"

This would've been fine, but I had the kill switch on, so it took me ~20 minutes just to get it off and get back on my internet. Maybe I'm just tech illiterate or something \ud83d\ude2d but I'd really appreciate if the kill switch feature would be shut off when you ran out of data, and maybe a notification would pop up (actually, I can't remember if one did, but I'm sure there was one that I missed). Again, it's a very good VPN, and the small issues I have with it could be overlooked."

This was a major selling point for me. And despite the occasional disconnect from the VPN, I still rate them 5 Star because they conduct themselves sincerely and professionally. If there's an issue, I can open a ticket and they will get back to me in a reasonable amount of time (within a day). However, I have come to learn that in many instances the reason for the disconnect was from my side. Because when I rebooted my computer I was able to fully access all servers normally.Their pricing is also reasonable and most importantly affordable. And when I use their service I am less concerned with online attacks, because I believe that their service is doing a good job of protecting my identity from most online predators.I am comfortable recommending them to others, because their service is consistent and I pretty much know what to expect from them."
