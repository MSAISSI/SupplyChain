Being outside of the United States, I may need to run certain document drafts past my own lawyer from time-to-time, but that will be the exception more than the rule. Most of the conversions for Canadian law will be more about re-naming comparable U.S. legal departments."

Until I found Plainly Legal. Not only did Plainly Legal make it SIMPLE for me to create documents and agreements with their library of templates, but it also gave me templates to use to protect areas of my business that I had not even considered. I mean, I had never thought of having my podcast guests sign a podcast waiver, or to ask for an agreement for clients who offer testimonials.I feel much more comfortable that I am legally protected in my new business. Just like car insurance, I hope I never NEED legal protection, but I'm glad I have it."

          "Contenu": "A beta program for legal software?. Legal? Really? Any normal person might cringe at the thought, but I jumped at the chance when Bobby Klinck opened the beta doors of Plainly Legal. This software grew from his template library, which is a rock-solid product presented in an easy-to-understand manner. Bobby brings great credentials to the table but leaves pretension behind\u2014there\u2019s always a sense of fun surrounding him even as he underpromises and over-delivers. I dived into the beta testing and every feature I\u2019ve worked with so far works as described and promises to be invaluable to me as a new business owner. His templates keep my website safe, and there\u2019s a legal audit feature coming which will help me discover what I\u2019m doing wrong and tell me exactly what I need to do to fix it. You can\u2019t beat that! Bobby continues to develop contracts that allow me to move past the scary legal stuff and know that I\u2019m covered to do what I love to do. Bobby and his team are always there to offer a friendly helping hand\u2014I\u2019ve even had email responses after business hours (but please\u2014let them have their well-deserved time off). To be transparent, my questions were all due to my own ignorance, not any issues with the software. Everything I\u2019ve experienced so far during beta testing supports my faith in Plainly Legal and what it can offer entrepreneurs in all niches.This is a 5-star company operated by 5-star people offering 5-star information!"

          "Contenu": "I rarely write reviews for anything, but Plainly Legal is so important to my business I felt moved to tell others.Deep down, everybody knows that being in business carries legal risks.  But that's all we know.  We don't have a sense of what those risks are, exactly; or the ramifications of anything in the legal world.  (Except that we don't want to be sued!)  We don't even know what we don't know.  It nags at the back of our minds.But ignoring the spectre and hoping it will go away, or \"it'll never happen to me,\" is no kind of strategy.Big companies have whole legal departments.  Medium-sized businesses have a lawyer (or a firm) on retainer.  But *every* business, whether you're one person in a pick-up truck or a Fortune 500 corporation, needs legal support.  Here are some scenarios:- If you have clients or customers, don't you need contracts, agreements, terms of service?  A refund policy?  Or do you just hope you'll never have a dispute?- If you have employees or subcontractors, don't you need employment agreements, subcontract scope-of-work, confidentiality, and non-disclosure agreements?  Or is every employee going to be a match made in heaven?- If you have an online presence, like a website, don't you need a solid privacy policy, terms of use, and disclaimer?  Or do you just hope that privacy laws have bigger fish to fry and you'll go unnoticed?Those are just a few common things to think about. However, business owners aren't lawyers and we don't know what we don't know.  What aren't we thinking about?  What's not even on our radar?But lawyers are expensive.  They notoriously charge you just to pick up the phone and say hello.  So we decide to gamble.  \"Since we can't afford legal help,\" we think, \"maybe just hope we don't need it.\"  Bad strategy, but it feels like there's no choice.  Roll the dice.Plainly Legal solves a LOT of these problems.First, what it's not:  It's not a lawyer.  You can't pick up the phone and get a live person to give you legal advice.  It's also not a law firm.  You can't pick up the phone and have them react to a lawsuit on your behalf.  Those kinds of things, you'll still need representation.But Plainly Legal CAN help you keep things from ever getting to that point.  And that's the missing piece.  That's the need in the market that Plainly Legal saw; and they address it elegantly for service-businesses that're somewhere between Zero- and Full-Legal-Department.Plainly Legal is the brainchild of a Harvard-trained lawyer with credentials as long as your arm.  He's top-notch.  I know, like, and trust him with my complex business.  I feel like I'm in good hands.- Plainly Legal does a great job with contracts, agreements, releases, NDAs, privacy policies, disclaimers, terms of use, and just about anything else I've run into.  And they're adding more all the time.- Plainly Legal does a great job with guidance and knowledge in plain English to fill-in the gaps so you don't feel like there's so much you don't know.  There are explanations and analysis galore to help guide you through the Heart of Darkness that is the legal jungle.- Plainly Legal does a great job of helping you analyze the current legal stance of your business and then bolster the areas where your legal strategy might be weak or unaddressed.Being able to make full eye-contact with those three major areas, there's a level of comfort and peace-of-mind that comes over you.  It's as if you had the power of a law firm giving you sound guidance, but without the worry of hemorrhaging cash every time you pick up the phone.I can't praise Plainly Legal enough.  If you're operating a service business (not so much for retail or physical products), Plainly Legal is likely going to help you immeasurably.  If you're anything like me and my company, you'll be glad you have Plainly Legal on your side."
