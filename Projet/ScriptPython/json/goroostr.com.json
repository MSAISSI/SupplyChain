          "Contenu": "GoRoostr made a good offer for my MacBook Pro, and they got great reviews here.  So when I got ready to sell it, I chose them over all the other companies I'd looked at.When they received my MacBook, they emailed me that they'd found some serious problems with it:  the touchbar and camera didn't work.  Those had been working fine, at least until I reformatted the hard drive the night before I shipped it to them.  I Googled and found some quick and easy software fixes that were recommended for both issues--change a setting, reset the SMC and the NVRAM, etc.  I forwarded them those links.GoRooster replied that they'd tried all that, nothing had worked, and now the computer was overheating (another new problem I'd never had with it).  They said they suspected problems with the logic board.  They told me they'd still buy it, but they dropped their offer by 60%.  I told them, never mind, just send it back to me.It took me less than an hour to get the touchbar and camera working, by resetting the NVRAM--a simple trick, and one of the suggestions I'd sent them.  The computer wasn't overheating--not even close (it\u2019s my lap it was sitting on, so I think I would\u2019ve noticed).  It was working fine, no problems that I could find.GoRoostr also sent the MacBook back to me with a login password that it didn't have when I shipped it to them.  I had to reformat the drive and reload the OS--again--before I could do anything with it.And when I'd originally shipped my MacBook to GoRoostr, I spent $20 on a heavy-duty laptop shipping box with a special foam insert to designed to protect it.  They sent it back to me in a different box, used, thinner and flimsier than the one I'd used, and padded with wads of paper that probably cost them 10 cents.  I had to go out and buy more packing materials before I could ship it to another company who wanted to buy it.And that second company I sent it to?  They found nothing wrong with my MacBook, and promptly paid me the full amount they'd offered (considerably more than GoRoostr's last offer)."

However, when I got to FedEx, they told me they could only send laptops with their laptop-shipping box at $16. Luckily I hadn't bought any specific box or bubble wrapping, otherwise I would have had to throw it away. If you make your messaging about the wrapping clearer, it can be a smoother experience for future customers.\r Thanks GoRoostr!"

Unlike other services that provide packing material, you are responsible for getting it there in one piece. So when hey quote you, factor in 15 bucks that you will need to spend out of pocket for the packing. I would of rather just gotten less money and got the packing material from them."

Hassle free process and they pick up the phone quickly when I called them and responded to my email quickly. Pleasure to do business with GoRoostr. I highly recommend them to anyone looking to sell anything Apple related. They definitely have a future Customer out of me. I was going to sell my MacBook Pro to another company but I\u2019m very happy that I sold it to GoRoostr."

Instead of recycling the laptop at Apple I found GoRoostr from a Google search.  I entered in all my laptop information and was told I would receive $161.  After filling in all the laptop information; I received an email with a prepaid FedEx packing label.  I  packed up the laptop with bubble wrap and a few days later I received an email asking to confirm my phone number is linked to my venmo.  Once I confirmed my cell is linked to my venmo account; I received the payment for exactly $161.  This process was easy and receiving $161 is better than giving it to Apple to recycle.  Definitely a good experience and I highly recommend people to do the same with their non-working laptop."

          "Contenu": "GoRoostr is truly best in class...not just because the prices offered are highly competitive, but because the customer service is second to none.I recently upgraded from an iPhone 12 Pro to an iPhone 15 Pro Max. I did my due diligence on a variety of companies who buy used Apple gear, and, with the exception of one (whose reviews are sketchy at best), GoRoostr offered as much if not more than its competitors. I was not surprised, as this has been my experince with GoRoostr over the years, selling a variety of Apple products.But what truly sets GoRoostr apart is its customer service. Before I actually placed my \"order\", I emailed them with a question, and got a responsive, courteous, friendly email back nearly immediately. With the GoRoostr-provided FedEx shipping label I dropped the iPhone package at my local FedEx store on Monday afternoon. It arrived the very next morning (Tuesday) at GoRoostr, where I received an email receipt from them that they received the package, and it would be evaluated and I would be made an offer by the close of business the very next day, Wednesday. I received an email from them on Wednesday morning that they had completed the evaluation, and immediately paid me in full by PayPal. So, in less than 48 hours, I went from wiping an iPhone, to shipping it, it being received, evaluated, processed, and paid. All the while GoRoostr remains in communication, with courtesy and respect.There are any number of companies out there who buy Apple products. But GoRoostr is second to none. When I (inevitably) have Apple products to sell, I will be working with them again."
