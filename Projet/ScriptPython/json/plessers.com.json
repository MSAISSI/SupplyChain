I was told I would get another one in two weeks. After two weeks had passed I was asked to call them. I asked for a refund which was repeatedly ignored until I finally contacted my credit card company."

The delivery guy showed up at 2pm.  I received a call from the delivery guy asking when I would be home. I stated that my appointment time was from 2:30 to 6.  The guy refused to wait half an hour and said that he needed to get to his next appointment.  Long story short, I refused the next delivery day attempt.  This is not how you take care of your customer. You don't show up ahead of schedule and refused to wait for the appointment time.  I will never do business with Plesser again."

She called several times to determine the side. I repeatedly said the dryer\u2019s left side but looking at it from the front it is the right side which was the criteria she kept going by. When the Samsung arrived, not only was it vented on the wrong side, but it was dented. I asked for a refund and purchased from another appliance dealer. Unacceptable."

It took three attempts to have the correct washer and dryer delivered. I took three days off of work and lost money. When I asked for compensation, they gave me $50 and told me I had to reach out to GE. Well no one I spoke to was rude, the entire experience was unproductive. I wanted to support a small business, instead of ordering online from Best Buy or something similar, but I was not rewarded with , the experience I had hoped for. The issue was that they didn\u2019t deliver the machine themselves, and instead farmed it out to a delivery company in New Jersey, who was unable to help me, and who made errors, so while Plessers didn\u2019t themselves make the mistake, they did choose to hire people who were incompetent. As I said, I did not feel I was adequately compensated for my loss of time and money. In the end, the machine works well , but I would not order from them again."

          "Contenu": "We called the evening of 5/10 to place an order for a dishwasher and spoke with Jenn. We called back to order it after I talked the options over with my wife but Jenn texted us back saying she was on another call but would call us before she left. She did not and never responded to our follow-up texts. I called the next day and placed the order with Peter Romano who was very nice and helpful. He told me I would get an email the night before with a delivery window. I then got an email from Plessers saying I would get a call the night before with my window. The morning of the delivery, I woke up to my wife panicking about the delivery people being at our home. I had only recived an email about the delivery 20 minutes before it arrived. Obviuously, this was not enough notice and luckily the deliverymen were nice enough to take their time unloading to allow me time to disconnect the old unit. I called Peter twice about this delivery issue and never got a call back. We used Plesser's based on a recommendation from a family member but after this we will be sure to never use Plesser's again and will be sure to tell all of our friends and family to do the same. Truly awful customer service!"

Unfortunately the delivery and subsequent interactions with Plessers went downhill from there. The first time the range was delivered, they said that it would not fit in the space even after they measured it. They did not bother to even try. I requested for them to come a second time and I was asked multiple times if the space was the correct measurement which we had confirmed multiple times. The second time they came, they asked if we did anything to increase the space and I said again, no it will fit. Sure enough, it fit - and with a little room. They then pushed the range in with force and as we found out after they left, caused a gas leak. We had to get our gas company to come and fix it. Extremely disappointed at how it was handled and there was no follow up whatsoever. We also asked for some sort of a discount or refund and that was completely ignored. Will not be going back to Plessers."

I said the number on the invoice was correct but not on the item delivered. One week after they tried to deliver the wrong oven I spoke with a different sales person who informed I was looking at another week or more to get the oven delivered. He was very helpful in arranging for me to pickup the oven that day. So I drove two hours each way and picked up the oven. I will not deal with these people again.

Plesser's failure to provide a reasonable delivery estimate evidences: (i) they have no idea what they are doing; or (2) they purposefully and fraudulently misrepresent estimated delivery dates in furtherance of finalizing a sale. I suspect its the latter. Moreover, I requested on multiple occasions for someone at Plessers to contact me and they have yet to respond.

The delivery company had our appliance in their possession for over 2 weeks, we finally received our refrigerator. I had to email and ask questions on how much longer it would take. I was never able to speak to a manager. After making 6 phone calls and waiting on the phone for over 4 hours in total over the 6 phone calls, I was told that I could drive down to Ohio and pick up the appliance myself. Then I was reached by 3 methods, email, text message and phone call. At which time I was told the appliance would arrive on a Saturday. I replied to all three methods of contact that my family was out of town that weekend and we cannot accept the delivery. I have a email confirming that they will reschedule. That following Saturday I received a phone call from the delivery company that they were at my house and needed me to open my garage. After I turned them away I had to make several phone calls in order to get a new date. Finally the appliance was being delivered on a Friday. When the shipment arrived, it was damaged. Scratches and dents, the back of the unit was severely damaged to where I had to bend the metal back in place. After talking with someone on the phone from the delivery company, I was told I could reject it or wait for the following day when Plessers was open and I would receive a significant discount. When calling Plessers to discuss my damaged appliance. The lady was not helpful and rude to me and my wife. When I sent the serial number to her and told her the damaged unit does sound fairly loud, her response was \"well because you are using this we cannot take it back.\" At which time I told her that the delivery company put the refrigerator in place and they plugged it in. We were not using it at all. Then she became insulting and you could even hear her giggling/laughing when my wife expressed her disgust with this whole experience. We then were told we could be credited for $300 (the cost of the extended warranty that we purchased). After rejecting that offer we then were told $375 was the highest we could receive. After checking around for this discontinued refrigerator, I was able to find another one from a different company. But we decided to take the low ball credit and not risk the possibility of waiting another 3+ weeks to receive another appliance that may be damaged as well. Overall we were not happy with this experience and would not take this risk again in the near future."

We stopped the person doing installation and show them the damage of the machine. We paid $249.99 for installation. He asked me whether accept some money for the damage. I told him I prefer a brand new one without any damage. He said he can ask GE technician come to change the front door so that i don\u2019t have to wait for using. He didn\u2019t tell me if I use the machine I will not have chance to change a new one. Anyway I agreed. A couple of days later, I received the appointment for changing the door. I asked excuse from my work staying at home for the service. The guy came and asked me if I have a broken TV. I was surprised ask him \u201care you sure it is TV?\u201d. He said \u201cyes\u201d. I said: \u201cno, I am waiting for changing the door of washer/Dryer. He checked the paper in his hand and showed me: \u201cyes, it is washer/Dryer\u201d. I did not feel the right person for changing the door because he didn\u2019t bring anything. He came in taking some pictures of the machine. During the conversation I asked him a couple of questions about the machine. I asked is there any program for \u201conly spinning\u201d? I occasionally only use spinning for hand washing clothes. He told me \u201cno \u201conly spinning\u201d program. You have to choose \u201cDelicates\u201d program instead of hand washing\u201d. Later I checked the website I found the program for only spinning. I feel very uncomfortable for the service. First, I was told the person will change the door, (one time service) it wasn\u2019t. Second, I was told I need another service for changing the door. I realized if the person like him careless and unprofessional to change the door, I may need more services. I don\u2019t have time for handling the problem. I called pleaser\u2019s asking for changing the new machine. I was told I don\u2019t have chance for changing new one because I have used it. I don\u2019t feel comfortable with it. I am disappointed from Plesser\u2019s service and suggested customer should buy from other stores."

          "Contenu": "If you dare buy from Plesser's, at least skip the $538.85 upcharge for \u201cGold Premium Inside Delivery\u201d. The salesperson convinced me to upgrade to Gold Delivery: \"Premium in home delivery includes a 2-man team unpacking your products, bringing them into your home and placing them in the room of your choice.\" The local delivery contractor was awful to work with, and only sent one person who refused to unpack or place the appliances in the room of my choice -- instead, they left them boxed and put them in one place.  I asked Plesser's to either 1) help compel the local contractor to finish the job or 2) issue a refund, but the representatives I spoke with were rude, condescending, and unwilling to help, and even threatened another delivery charge if the local company returned to finish their contracted work.       Full narrative below.I purchased Gold Insured delivery for $538.85: \"Premium in home delivery includes a 2-man team unpacking your products, bringing them into your home and placing them in the room of your choice.\" My experience and the service were extremely poor and did not reflect this commitment, more resembling that of Standard Delivery, not Gold Insured. The delivery window I was provided was 4-8pm, and I made arrangements to be present during that time. The driver called at 2:30pm and said they would be there in 20 minutes, so I left my meeting right away and rushed up to the house. The driver left me waiting and did not arrive until 3:45pm anyway, so I did not need to leave my meeting nor rush. The delivery team consisted of one man who immediately declared he would only put them in one place all together \u2013 he would not take them to the room of my choice, nor unbox or inspect them. He also refused to move the appliances intended for the basement, even though one flight of stairs was to be included, and instead dropped them in the garage.  Because he was alone, he asked me to help him move each item and stabilize the dolly after the first appliance he attempted to move alone slipped and created a hole in our wall. His delivery instructions clearly read \"PGOLD SERVICE LEVEL GOLD: 1-2 PERSON DELIVERY,  UNCRATED AND INSPECTED DELIVERED INSIDE HOMETO ROOM OF CHOICE, 1 FLIGHT INCLUDED\" each part of which he ignored or fought.  The result is all our appliances (except those intended for the basement) are in one location \u2013 still boxed/crated and uninspected. I am left with a hole in our wall and to figure out how to unbox and move all these appliances, having already paid $538.85 to prevent those very problems.  Plesser's representatives were rude, condescending, and unwilling to help, and even threatened another delivery charge if the local company returned to finish their contracted work."

Unfortunately our newly finished hardwood floors were scraped with their hand trucks, and the refrigerator waterline was improperly installed. As as result the floors are left that way, and we had GE Appliance service come to our house twice to replace parts and fix the problem.We were also not informed by our salesman that our stove required a Trim Kit to complete the installation. When we called him his response was Oh yes they don't come with them anymore, and we don't handle that-- just go to Home Depot and buy one they're all the same. Not much support after spending $6500!!We instead went to your website and found the kit listed, and ordered it through GE Parts. Needles to say we found this experience a total disappointment."

I then went to PC Richards, and Appliance world, where appliance world worked with me on install and delivery price and a small discount. In addition your install and delivery staff are high end delivery people. They delivered the frig and it was obvious they wanted to leave ASAP to their next delivery.  Not impressive for a high end appliance store. On the other hand Appliance world has a dedicated staff that only installs. They solved problems on the spot and I was their only stop for the day.

After I inquired at the end of January about my delivery, I was told that this model had been discontinued and I would need to pay $450 more for the newer model.  Ok, this happens.  But the old model is still available on their website to trick other people into purchasing and then having to eventually pay more.  Once the oven was delivered, we installed it and it did not work.  We contacted our sales person about this and also the mail in rebate.  I have got no reply in 2 weeks now.  Good thing Frigidaire was out to fix this warranty repair.  I will never order from Plesser's again."

I said yes and then she said that dishwasher wasn't available. I asked about another model and we talked price, delivery and extended warranty which she included my invoice.  I live in MA and asked if they sell to MA customers which she said yes. She asked how many steps to get where the kitchen is.  I've never had a delivery count the steps up to my house.  Delivery is delivery in MA.  I had to pay extra for a few steps.  I gave my credit card number and asked what the total amount would be. She said they'd send me the invoice.  I've never bought anything w/o knowing the total amount before hand. When I finally got the invoice, they incorrectly charged MA sales tax on the delivery and extended warranty.  I had to call accounting to clear things up.  There was $50 rebate on delivery and she said she'd give me a $50 credit instantly so I wouldn't have to wait the 12 weeks for a rebate.  I had to ask multiple times for the $50. It was a huge headache buying from Plesser's.  In the end the salesperson made good but I had to keep at her.  Never again will I buy from Plesser's."

Because of a changes in the design of the kitchen the opening for the Range is 36\" inches. I called Plessers requesting a return of the 30\" inch (which is still in the box on the pallet in my garage) and I would purchase the 36\" inch Wolf from Plessers as a replacement. The larger Wolf Range is $4K more expensive then the 30\" inch. When we called our Sales Representative (Mario) he informed us that Plessers policy is that they cannot take back high end appliances as they are considered a special order. This was never communicated to us when we purchased the range, I have escalated to the owners and received a call from the Sales Manger two days ago with no update on the status of returning the 30\" and purchasing a 36\" inch.  On the Plessers's website the continually tout a \"family owned business\" that provides \"Old Fashioned Customer Service\",  based on the return policy and run-around we are now going through, this is not a true statement."

The person who scheduled my installation was seriously untrained.  She started by not giving me the option to have the refrigerator installed  and old one removed (despite the fact the sales person instructed me to make these arrangements with them) and instructed me to call Plesser's again who basically just turned me back to her again.  I ended up calling them back and got the same girl.  This time she ended up quoting me the wrong prices (10 times as much as anyone else) to take the old fridge away and to install the new fridge with the water connector.  I was at a point I was going to cancel this completely until she called me back to apologize for the mistake.  But then she got confused again and told me that I would get a new delivery date.  As it turned out, the old one was never cancelled and I got 20 minutes notice they were coming.  Add to that, the fridge had a dent in it and the door replacement is on back order and even that took a host of phone calls from LG, to Plesser's Cust Service and to the shipping company to get this taken care of.  Way too much of my life spent on this to ever deal with them again.  But who knows how long before I even hear back from anyone regarding the new door.  I will definitely stick to local places like Best Buy in the future."

One box is damaged and I\u2019m afraid to even open it at this point.They need to fire the warehouse employees that treat the appliances with total disregard. The range looked like it had been dropped 10 feet from a fork lift.At least they send out new appliances and give you an extended warranty for your troubles.Buy from them if you want a good deal and are in no hurry to get your appliances."

What could be improved on however, is the lack of communication we got for our order. All we got initially was the expected ship date. Up until the week we were supposed to get delivery of the new refrigerator our scheduled ship daye never changed. Luckily I called the carrier that was supposed to deliver a few days before the delivery date only to find out from them it was on backorder and wouldn't ship for another 2-3 months. Just added to the frustration of backordered appliances. and BTW- Plessers charged the whole amount even though they knew it was going to be several months before shipment. They did credit most of the purchase price, holding back some as a deposit to keep our order open after I called and complained. Communication people, that's a big part of it and they weren't good at it. The price was good at least."

Regarding the delivery, I paid extra for them to bring the appliance inside the house and they should have uncrated and unwrapped for me to check before acceptance. The delivery company brought the appliance in and rushed my wife to sign. She asked them about the service we paid. They said they could unwrap it but would not take the trash away. Okay?! We have a trash can. But then they left without even uncrate it as promised in the service we paid. My wife called Plesser's and the girl said \"oh, from the picture I can see the appliance is still sitting on the crate\". She said someone or manager would call me.

Delivered late after 5pm and after my contractor already left. Guys who delivered got it in the house fine but left all the packaging trash on the front lawn. I don't know if the refrigerator was knocked around during shipping. It made a high pitched continuous noise when first plugged in and the next day when I called service. It has since stopped. It was also a bit difficult to schedule delivery. They use robocalls and emails to confirm the delivery window they're offering but it's only a yes or no choice. There is no option for a different window. There is a long hold to speak with someone and they weren't quick to respond via email. Super nice once I could talk to them."

Due to bad experience with other retailers in past, I called Plessers c/s and they assured me another Plessers team would make the delivery on 9/22. But that did not happen. Instead, the delivery service  pushed the refrigerator from the middle of kitchen toward wall with no floor protection as Jose and Eric did on 9/21and now I have deep zig zag grooves on my hardwood floor. Upsetting, and will be costly to repair. However, had to give 4 stars because I used Plessers during hurricane Sandy, they were great then but disappointed now ; they do not take responsibility when their drivers damage your floors."

We were out of town and could not arrange coverage on such short notice. They said they would deliver the following week but not sure what day. Finally, three phone calls later I got them to agree to deliver the following week. Then they gave me two different delivery windows from two different people on the same day.

Your guys assured me that my sanitation people would take them away as is, but this was not the case. I had to break down the cartons, and the wood pallets, tie them up, and make it nice and neat for the sanitation department to do the cart away. So I missed the first pick up day and the stuff sat there for a few more days. It took me about 90 minutes to do it, and I have a bad back. I was not very happy and I had tipped them generously. They could have been more accommodating. What can you do?"

The several staff I interacted with over time until delivery in October/November were always knowledgeable and extremely helpful. What sets Plessers above the rest? Service after purchase! During delivery, 2 of the delivery men damaged the refrigerator - how ironic, the items travel 3000 miles to California and the damage occurs in the last 100 feet while carrying the fridge up the stairs - the bottom of the fridge cardboard box hit the stair railing denting the side panel). The delivery driver called Plessers immediately, and Daniel Lastraglio, Escalations Coordinator responded in an exceptional manner: Plessers would either replace the unit, give me a credit for the damage, or give me a complete 5-year warranty on the fridge. I chose the credit.What a terrific experience. Kudos to Plessers. Fellow purchasers, you will be in good hands and get the best products, service and price. They are the gold standard. Sheldon"

Mike demonstrated a genuine commitment to resolving our issues and he was able to facilitate a replacement for our defective unit in a timely manner.  After not having a refrigerator for 2 weeks, Mike and Plesser\u2019s literally swooped in with a solution and became our heroes.  What truly sets Mike apart is his dedication to customer satisfaction. Recognizing our frustration with the previous experience, he actively pursued a solution to ensure we were satisfied. Mike's proactive approach and determination resulted in a successful resolution, and we were able to replace our problematic refrigerator.Plesser's Appliances, as a whole, provides an excellent shopping experience, boasting a wide selection of high-quality products and a welcoming atmosphere. The customer service we received from Mike was nothing short of exceptional, and we are now loyal customers thanks to his efforts.If you're in need of top-notch appliances and unparalleled customer service, look no further than Plesser's Appliances. Ask for Mike, and you'll undoubtedly receive the same outstanding assistance that made our appliance shopping experience a pleasure.

Their website is kind of clunky and could use some updating but I have found that taking notes and calling to talk to a CSR is really helpful.  They will help you save the most money, answer all questions, get a great deal on extended warranties, and get all of the rebates.  I am so glad that I found them."
