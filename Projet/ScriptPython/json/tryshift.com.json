Little did I know that you can't even split tabs (i.e. two tabs in a workspace vertically or horizontally), nor can you use screen sharing on Slack due to not being able to have pop out windows. I've purchased Rambox instead, which has all of those features and seems like a much better product."

          "Contenu": "For 3+ years I was a massive fan of Shift. I couldn't operate without it. I loved it mostly because I could operate all 3 Google accounts and their Drives in ONE place - as well as - LinkedIn, Grammarly, Calendly, Messenger, Weebky and AWeber. But mostly, every app or email account had its own set of independent tabs. THAT was gold. Then came Shift Ultra, and that's when issues began for me. Now all the tabs are shared (which defeats the main advantage of Shift). So you have to create Workspaces - which I don't need - to get an independent suite of tabs (as it was before). And there have been numerous other annoying glitches - mostly random setting changes as a result of the upgrade.  I've spent 3-4 hours with customer service (who have been excellent, I must add) trying to get Shift to operate somewhere near as effective as it was, and I'm not there yet. What frustrates me a lot is Shift keeps raving about how good the 'Ultra' upgrade is for workflow, yet there IS NOT ONE VIDEO demonstrating WHY and HOW the new version is superior. But I can't see how it's better. I need that video demo! To Shift's credit, they have offered me a sweet deal for the next year but I'm still wanting to see how the upgrade is an improvement!"

Running all of my Google Suite apps through it really helped my computer run more efficiently instead of running everything in multiple Chrome tabs.  But since upgrading to v8 I have had numerous problems.  Opening Google Sheets or Docs often results in a white window that does nothing. Switching between my 2 gmail accounts often does the same thing.  Shift used to be a helpful tool... now it's pretty frustrating."

Just another sidebar which I don't need as I can just make folders in my browser for quick links anyway"

          "Contenu": "Later edit: The new version has a bunch of annoying bugs, and when I went to support, after 13 emails back and forth with screen recordings, they told me, \"I'm doing everything right; we don't know,\" and then asked me to download the \"Alpha\" version of Shift, which guess what: the Alpha version won't work on my MacBook. And yes, I did download the MacBook version. Now, I deleted the buggy version of the app, and Alpha won't work for fuc* knows what reason. So I need to download the old app again to get access to work. Guys, stick to Opera, it's free. Random idea: Instead of spending tons on ads to acquire customers, what about some more tech engineers? It makes sense to sell only annuals, right? The retention problem is solved. If this was a free app, fair enough, but I paid an annual, and I expect bugs to be solved, NOT ME BEING ASKED TO GODDAMN DELETE WHO KNOWS WHAT FOLDERS AND THEN THE APP ITSELF. Bugs: Google Calendar freezes, opening new windows from an app integrated won't work, email freezes sometimes, maps works on and off, extensions are cra sometimes (Grammarly, for example)Below is the 4-star review, edited above after more use:****This tool has a lot of potential and was exactly what I needed. Multiple workspaces, so I don't always need to open a bunch of Chrome windows, which is a nightmare.The only problem is this is buggy; the screen freezes randomly here and there, then Gmail freezes, and some extensions are not working properly. The other day I was in Google Maps, and it just did not work, so I had to open Chrome to look for whatever. Then Grammarly acts weird, and so on.Support is great, but if bug fixes are not coming soon, I'll use Opera; it offers literally the same functions for free."

Basic features have been removed during the 'upgrade' (?!) and it's worse than ever at loading up applications.I've been paying for $100 a year for the last 2 years and have now cancelled. They made no attempt to keep me as a customer or ask for feedback, so if that doesn't tell you what they think about their customers, just look to see if they've responded to any of the critical comments on here (spoiler: they haven't).I've now downloaded Franz and - although it's early days - already having a better experience on the free version than I ever did using Shift."

Asked for a refund within the 14day trial (which in my opinion isn't long enough to get to know and use the tool properly to build a workflow) and the support person persuaded me to stay and use the new beta v8 version which has lots of updates for Macbook M1. This version may have been worse than the previous version. It really doesn't offer that much over using programs individually as it slows your computer down considerably and when the apps break, you have to open and use them anyway. Now they won't refund me my money because i'm outside the 14 day period. Bad execution on building the software and poor support rules. Not what you'd expect from a new SaaS company."

Within the first 24 hours of having an account, they had sent me 7 emails in addition to the 'welcome' emails. I thought that this might correct itself over time, but nope - still getting a huge number of emails filtered through to my spam folder (I added an email rule specifically for this).The biggest gripe I have is that the unsubscribe link in their emails do not work! I contacted them on Twitter about this, and they informed me that I should open a support ticket.Judging by the reviews, I'm glad I didn't bother as it sounds like they simply don't respond. In the end, I decided to block them at email server level as I was tired of their emails filling up my spam folder. You know a company is bad when you get frustrated by their emails being delivered to a folder specifically designed for spam."

There\u2019s too much competition to deal with companies who don\u2019t care about your time.  As a rule, if they don\u2019t show love when prospecting you, it\u2019s a strong indication that you\u2019ll get worse treatment when you become a customer.  Only then they have your time and money!I also suspect that many of the 5 star reviews are internally motivated.  Who leaves a 5 star review with the only text: Great customer service when all the 1 star reviews indicate the opposite. Another sign of fake reviews is many are from people that have only written one review for Shift."

Also, if you subscribe to the basic plan you don't actually get access to probably the main reason why you'd want the app in the first place: a platform where you can manage multiple apps and emails at once. In other words, unless you subscribe to their service (which is annual by the way so you can't try it out for a month) you literally only have a tool that lets you switch between inboxes. You also get flooded with pop-ups that keep trying to get you to subscribe. And have fun sending out emails, because it's going to be signed off with 'Sent from Shift' which can only be removed if you pay $99 per year for their premium plans.Shift is clearly designed by the same people who think spam and pop-up ads are a good way to convince users that your product is good. If you think that's a software that suits you, then go ahead."

Essentially, all it does is combine all your accounts in one browser-like set-up - (What the heck?!) I can do that with chrome or safari as well - no added value there.What annoyed me most is that when you run into a problem, you have to fill out a whole service ticket with all kinds of information about your account and name and stuff (when you're paying advanced, you might expect to not have to do that). And then the solutions I got was mostly stuff like \"Log out of everything and delete app data and log back in\". OK, that is exactly what I DON'T want to do - that's why I got this software :DI do NOT recommend this software to anyone! Waste of money!"

Unfortunately, the execution is fairly poor. The product is very buggy. Every day, multiple times, the entire program just completely shuts down. When you email customer support, you'll get an answer a day later that basically asks for more information and says that their engineers are working on it, but you won't get any resolution for months (if ever). But, as buggy as the product is and as frustrating as the poor CS is, I was strongly considering renewing at the previous rate. But, instead they jacked up the prices. It's now $150 per year for what is basically a browser that allows multiple logins at once. But, good luck expressing to them how absurd this is. All you ever hear back is how much they've thought about the price increases and how rare complaints are. Okay, if you say so. When your churn goes through the roof, do me a favor and don't come begging your old clients to come back. You had a chance to take care of the longstanding clients and instead you decided to ignore concerns and jack up the prices."

Upon doing so, the shift team offered me a full year of the pro version for free. So, they refunded me and I took the offer.  I must say that while the platform was useful, it comes with challenges.  Every other day there would be a glitch somewhere in the dashboard, or a new update.  Many times the dashboard would open up, but would not function.  Meaning I could not navigate through any of my mail, folders, drafts..   This was extremely frustrating.While support would have me uninstall the software, try an alpha or beta version instead, each with their own bugs and glitches, which I gladly would create a support ticket for.  I just was fed up with having to be their guinea pig and never any real fix or improvement.When I saw that my subscription was about to expire, I did reach out to them to see if they would continue my free \"pro\" subscription since I was a loyal customer and they simply told me NO!  Not even a substantial discount. #TryshiftfailWhile I am always looking at new technology and innovative products for my team, TryShift just doesn't make the mark for both their product or their support!

If you want to use other applications like Trello, Whatsapp, or anything that's not an email account, you have to pay for the Advanced version, which is $99.99 a year. The Pro version only allows for the use of multiple email accounts, and costs $29.99 a year. The only subscription option is yearly for both versions. Would have absolutely loved this, but $99 upfront is just too much if you're still in school/college/university.

Having apps and accounts streamlined really boosted my workflow, productivity, and mental clarity.However, after a few months, the account was spontaneously downgraded. After almost 2 additional months of back and forth with support, I still didn't have access to the original subscription. The person I was in communication with was friendly and responsive at first, but literally did not acknowledge the nature of the issue and kept asking for the credit card on file (there was none since I never had a paid account). I question whether or not she actually read the emails. Eventually she stopped responding unless I followed up, became less and less friendly, and I finally just deleted the account. I loved the product but felt there was a significant disconnect with customer support that made it impossible to benefit from the Shift in a reliable way. Ultimately, the issues with customer support cost a great deal of time and I lost all of the benefits of streamlined productivity."

With several workspaces and even when using a high-end machine, it's just too slow compared to the browser. That might have something to do with the 32-bit mode that it operates in (on Windows at least)2. Extension support. Ultimately, this is where a lot of little bridges are burned since there's a wealth of extensions that make Chrome and other browsers that much more useful.However, A+ to their customer support.If you're in the same boat as I was, try Workona instead, it's a game-changer that achieves a lot of what Shift tries to achieve, but does it all in the browser."

I have a huge gamer PC, I doubt that the performance problems are related to hardware.Also, one of the features that made me unsubscribe was that the update alt-tabbed everything 2 or 3 times before showing up. Let's say you're in a game, and the update finishes, shift will minimize your game but there's nothing, so you re-open the game, then it will minimize it again, with nothing to show you, of course. Then on the 3rd time, it will tell you that there's been an update and that it needs to restart. It can't get any more annoying than that when you're playing an online game.I used to like it, but for 100USD/year it has to be better."

There are currently just three issues for me that prevent it from being a five star app. 1.) For those of us with a ton of apps open (discord, slack, gchat, linked in, etc etc), it would be great to be able to group and expand/collapse the app icons on the side of shift. The way discord does with its server management works perfect. You can google examples of how this works.2.) When doing video chats or huddles with screen sharing, I need to be able to pop that out to a floating window I can move away from the shift window. You used to be able to do this in shift 7.3.) Whenever someone replies to a thread in slack, i don't get any notifications."

My experience has improved 200% with this, that's why I **want** to give you 5 stars.Cons 1: there is *only* one con that's prompting me to write this review and remove one star... REFRESH. There are some applications that I need to know in advance that there's a message, click somewhere, and then back (or refresh directly which is a pita) in order to get an updated list with new messages. It's a pita that I'm ok living with, but it's preventing the app from being perfect. Refreshing needs to be your biggest priority in my mind, WhatsApp requires SOOOO many clicks in-and-out for the notification to get updated.Con 2: I understand that the concept works *only* for web-based applications, but I think you guys should really figure out a way to make non-web-based apps (e.g. Signal) to work with it... it's still silly having to have Signal opened somewhere else. Not a dealbreaker, but stillRecommendation: Remove the \"[+] Add to Shift\" from the panel and move it to the \"... Options\", once you've installed all the stuff you need, that icon there is just ugly (or make it optional in the config panel)."

Customer support was immediately responsive, and followed up afterwards to make sure everything was working properly again."

I'm in Sales and track with multiple tools. Being able to use those plugins are important and almost made me quit using Shift because the there wasn't a plugin available to track email opens. Overall, very happy and will probably re-up my premium subscription."

At least they have helped me fix the things I needed, so thank you. Adding a star.ORIGINAL: While I like the ease of having all my emails together so that I can see them all at the same time, the company did me a little wrong. I bought the version where the \"Sent with Shift\" message was not supposed to show up on my emails, but it did and I had tons of people asking about Shift. I don't mind helping others out, but do not think it's ethical for a company to expect me to do advertising for them when I had already paid not to. I contacted Shift twice about this and never received a response. Besides that, I don't like how it opens up links in the app and not opening them up in my browser."

Efficiency with navigating through 4 accounts: 3 stars. Although I loved the ability to navigate through my accounts throughout the free trial period, every time I tried to navigate from one account to the next, the amount of time it took seemed like countless minutes. It made me check my internet speed to see if I was the problem, but I had all 4 bars. Billing process after free trial period: 5 stars! This program will allow you to stay connected with them for as long as you want with a (free) Shift account. You are not billed anything after the free trial period, but it is completely up to you to upgrade to the advanced Shift account or to leave them altogether. I really admire this program and would highly recommend this application for anyone who uses multiple accounts on a daily basis! Thanks Shift!"

Google is such a pain when managing multiple accounts, and of the 140+ accounts in my organization, I access a dozen of them on a consistent basis. The four or five accounts that I find I need to keep open perpetually, I have right at my fingertips with Shift Workspaces. I also love, in regards to Workspaces, how easy it is to keep my browsing compartments separated. As an IT Manager, anything related to my job managing the security and operations of technology goes in my IT email workspace. My personal work email, I can keep browser tabs open that are my individualized and my personal Gmail account has browser tabs for recipes to suggest to my wife, and birthday party planning for my kids, etc...As if that wasn't enough, the apps within each (or some/all workspaces) that you can add are tailored to your specific workspaces and also right at your fingertips. But no need to clutter that up by also having your Gmail, Google Calendar, Drive, etc apps there as well. There's a dedicated, dynamically changing set of icons at the top right of your app to hop right into your Google Workspace apps without taking up unnecessary space elsewhere.Seriously, Shift has done the impossible. I only regret that I didn't find out about/adopt it sooner. If you don't get this app, my heart goes out to you."
