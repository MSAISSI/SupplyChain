Sent a follow up on the 12th and got a response on the 14th saying they hadn't received my parcel and did I have proof of delivery. I emailed back with proof and then they 'checked' and they magically did have it. There wasn't a proper explanation other than 'Christmas', which seems pretty dodgy considering they admitted my parcel arrived on the 20th December but on the 14th they had no record. Would never use again, and a lesson to keep you post office receipts safe!"

The payment processing notifications were so unreliable I ended up making two orders simply trying to get the product. Because my first order was not confirmed going on two weeks, I made a second order. Even so, I had to call and wait for nearly an hour before I was responded to and only then got confirmation that my first order would go through along with my second; however, at this point, I chose to cancel my first order because I had purchased the product somewhere else (B&H Photo) since it had been nearly 2 weeks with no news on the matter. I allowed my second order to process through only because I reached the rep on the phone to confirm the order. My advice, look into your SLA with the payment processor Joby is using because i could not be more unhappy. I may recommend the product but based on my experience will suggest people buy it from a reseller instead. Cheers"

Originally, I figured I didn't know how to you it properly however after reading the manual and using it for 4 days I decided it was just easier to replace it. Because not only did it overheat after barely using it, it also would rapidly jerk side to side on its own before completely spazzing as if it were having a seizure. And the customer service is even worse. I have attempted to call the return number about twice a week for 2 weeks and have given up every time after no one answer the phone after over 30 minutes of waiting.It really seems as if they are intentionally making it difficult to contact so they can keep my money. In the time that it has taken to request a refund I have already ordered and received a better product from a different company which ultimately ended up being cheaper. Even after I do eventually get ahold of someone I'm still expected to pay to ship the broken product back meaning at the end of this ordeal it will have cost money to get noting from them, This is the last time I take a chance with an online tech company."

          "Titre": "Beamo & Beamo Mini",
          "Contenu": "So let me be clear Joby as a company I've found great to talk with in the UK & the service very good especially delivery & an order issue so 5* there then. Kibo not so good 30min wait to endless crappy music to sort an order issue. So my advice in the UK ring Joby not Kibo if you have an order issue. This is a review of Beamo/Mini as s product. The actually quality of lighting is VERY Very good and both units are robust well made so definitely no issues here. Both Beamo/Mini are meant to bring studio lighting versatility and they do, or rather potentially do but for my gripes. Now the reason for 1* review. The quality of the supplied diffuser is very good for lighting & skintones BUT it does NOT stay on the Beamo/Mini.  THIS means Vlogging it will fall off. THIS means Selfies it will fall off. THIS means taking a picture it will fall off. THIS MEANS ANY MOVEMENT AND IT WILL FALL OFF. THIS means you will lose it because it will fall off.THIS means the moment is lost because it fell off. THIS means you have spent \u00a360/80 on a spotlight because you will not notice when it falls off and when you need it & YOU WILL NEED IT , it will be lost because it fell off. How good is that for Professional mobile/studio use when vlogging or taking shots? Are replacements available free Joby do they even exist? The diffuser is essential on the Beamo/Mini for any type of perfect skin on the move vlogging or selfie photography it's rare your going to want a blinding spot light in your face so why does it NOT fit or stay put on any of the the 3 Beamo & 3 Mini lights I purchased no matter which way you fit IT even with red lines aligned? Massive BASIC negative flaw on a great product at \u00a360/\u00a380 for a PRO light. So expect a deluge of complaints starting with me when consumers realise the diffuser is so bad or should I say so GOOD at FALLING off. What are you going to do Joby to fix this or am I meant to use sellotape, super glue, blue tack, paper clip, velcro, chewing gum, scrunchie, barbed wire or honey to try and keep the diffuser on the Beamo? Whilst I'm on about diffusers how about adding some colour variant diffusers for warm/cool light shots & please Joby make sure they fit and don't fall off? Now another reason for the 1* review. The My Joby app. The app is essentially at this release BEYOND a poor afterthought for the Beamo! It default opens to a Joby camera mode and asks \"Resume Last Scene\" repeatedly a basic unnecessary function for 99.999% of Beamo customers so we can take pictures and videos using IT....WHY? I don't know but if you have a poor camera/phone your probably not going to spend \u00a360/\u00a380 on a Beamo Professional light as your probably going to use that money to by a better phone/camera? I use a P30 pro camera which already has amazing camera software & invested in Beamo @ \u00a380 as a Professional mobile light for LIGHTING!  Every customer like myself downloading the App wants to CONTROL the Beamo settings & scenes NOT use it for taking photo/video shoots, so how about default opening to just Beamo functions or giving me the choice here? The brightness slider is difficult to set precisely, saving editing deleting of scenes are all extremely poorly implemented. Bluetooth connection works but is horrible for more than one light, lacking an obvious add button in the app so you can control two or more Beamo/Minis, come on this is meant to be used by creative people and with gorillapod rigs no-one wants this much faff to setup stuff we want to have fun & create! The app urgently needs a superfast update like last week Joby! I can't even justify 1* star for it in its current truly horrible amateur guise, it does work but barely only just. Also whilst improving it why not add game changing Alexa style voice app control to setup functions \"Beamo 5% Brightness \u201c it's already connected via bluetooth why not make the Beamo experience truly unique & outstanding (its already better than our replaced lumecubes in pure lighting terms) or more importantly invest in the app quality and actually make it about enjoying using your Beamo with a diffuser that doesn't FALL Off? Sort out the App and the diffuser and it's 5* BON JOBY, but for me with  Beamo/Mini priced @\u00a360/\u00a380 and the issues mentioned it's only a 1* review. Time will serve as to the merit of this review will Joby get the Beamo app right & the diffuser sorted? Mark the date of this review as I am keeping my Beamos and trusting Joby will. As for now a quality company releasing a new product without finishing their homework properly into the market well that's just plain BAD JOBY!"

I would have give it 3 or 4 stars if the hype was not over the top for years hearing about this so so product that was a huge let down.  Lastly, the phone holder is great to be fair\u2026if you are ONLY doing vlogs then it\u2019s okay for that I guess but the PRICE NEED TO BE CUT IN HALF to really be fair to the consumer.  Usually don\u2019t post comments but Joby sent me this survey lol. If you find it used or on clearance grab one!!!"

          "Contenu": "My experience with Jobi has been ridiculous.  I had hoped to surprise my son with the tripod for cell phones.  Instead of getting a confirmation, I got an error with billing.  When I tried to call to address the issue, I was unable to get through to you.  I I tried to cancel the order as suggested on the website.  I had thought that was successful, , so  reordered the product.  Then a week went by, then two, then confirmation that the first order was being processed, and my card was charged.  Three days later, I was charged again, and the product was sent out a second time.  My son received his package, then I got an update from UPS saying that the product was stuck in limbo due to this crisis we\u2019ve all been enduring.  My account has still not been refunded, because I can\u2019t get through on the phone.  I have tried calling several times, and been stuck on hold each time for so long that it becomes apparent that there\u2019s NO ONE THERE.  At this moment, I\u2019ve been on hold for 29 minutes, with no end in sight.  I wouldn\u2019t order from this company if it was the last place to get this stuff on Earth.  Your products may be fabulous, but since your service is truly atrocious, that has no bearing on being a repeat customer .  I really hope you\u2019re able to straighten this obvious glitch out, for your own sake.... 35.5 minutes and counting!"

The joby legs start popping out of the sockets which makes it very troublesome to try and adjust after I\u2019ve already fiddled with it to get a proper placement. It would be wise if your company developed a relationship with a credible wireless remote shutter manufacturer, this is a great product but it is definitely missing something to amaze me."

It was like that from the moment I took it out of the box and tried it on the beamo mini light- I rotated it all four directions but it never actually attached and stayed on the light. It falls off even if the light is upright or mostly/completely erect. The light doesn\u2019t even have to be facing down for the filter to fall off. I\u2019d like a refund of $10 or more for the filter because that was a waste of my money to include it if it\u2019s not even going to stay on through a simple photography session. Also, the gorilla pod was not as good of quality as I expected. The joints in some of the legs feel much tighter than others- whereas other \u201cjoints\u201d of the bendy legs are super loose. One of the legs breaks in half if I bend it around something at one of the joints in the leg. Pretty disappointed as I thought this was a more rugged and well-build brand."

          "Contenu": "Good quality product. Phone attached to it means I can be hands free to answer and view it whilst doing other things. When resting I can wrap it round my leg with the bendy feet and view my phone like a Tv screen. Rarely do I loose where I have placed my phone now! Taking photos of moving objects with the phone propped up in the pod means no camera shake. Ideal litttle gadget. A great purchase!"

          "Contenu": "The equipment is well designed that\u2019s the first thing I noticed when I opened the box. It is constructed of Solid materials with clearly identified controls and connections.  This was easy to set up and the sound output as well as input can be set up for interviews or a single speaker.  The quality of sound for my meetings and presentations has improved and noticed by my colleagues.  Several coworkers saw it on my desk and wanted to borrow it.  It\u2019s sturdy but light enough to take on travel.  Thank you for a great product"
