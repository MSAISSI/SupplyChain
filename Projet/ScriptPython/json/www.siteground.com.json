I was under the impression that I had opted to not auto renew, which applied to the hosting part only. I have therefore been charged for the domain for another year and I no longer require the site. When I contacted them on the same day about a refund, I was told a refund was no longer possible and it was out of their hands. As a small business this is a lot of money of which big companies like Siteground are happy to take advantage. I could understand if auto renew kicked in 3 days in advance, but 15 days??"

I'm not sure. Bottom line, they continued to blame the web designer even though the facts they produced showed the bad code was there before she stepped into the picture. They are either liars or ignorant. I don't care which, I'm moving all my sites to another host company. The fact that they can't fess up and admit that it was their poor security that allowed this malicious code is reason enough for me to move to another vendor."

Perhaps my fault but I told them about my difficulties up front. I had to cancel before I ever started. The experience was extremely frustrating . They also didnt have a real person chat easily available .  They might be great for a Tekkie , but for an 80 with eye issues and not so quick, definitely go somewhere with better customer service."

          "Contenu": "For 8 years, my site has worked with no problem on hostgator.Now that I am on siteground my site is constantly offline. Siteground is taking my site down to punish me as a client. My site is 17GB, and I have purchased 60GB of space. Today I decided to try Siteground's optimizer plugin. I tried their plugin before but it broke my site. When I contacted them about it they blamed me for using their plugin on my site and said I was causing the problem. Today I tried it in my staging copy and it broke my site again. I gave up and deleted the staging copy. I still had plugins to try so I created another staging copy. I opened that staging copy and I got site grounds \"site under construction page\" even though I have a full website. So I deleted that copy and tried again to create a staging copy.After that my site went offline. I could not access my portal or anything. I called Siteground and they told me I was over 60 Gn space.. But I was only using 17gb. Even though I deleted the staging copies that 1. was destroyed by sitegrounds plugin and 2. a staging copy that never worked. So in essence my company's website does not work because I tried a Siteground plugin that didn't work, so Siteground is punishing me by taking my site down. Now my site is taking 45 GB even though it's only 17 GB and I have no staging copies. So old copies of staging sites that I erased are keeping me offline because Siteground is saying I am over my disk space limit... So if you use their tools as intended, Siteground will break your site and no one there takes any responsibility now that my 17gb site is taking more than 45 GB, siteground is blaming me and my site is offline. If your business relies on a website, the worst decision you can make is to use SitegroundTheir reply is what they do - blame customers. I deleted the staging copies from my server. The Siteground server did not process the deletion. SO their glitch took me down. Please read their reply. They said my staging copies (that I deleted) put me over the limit. I was not over the limit! A glitch in their server left my deleted copies, and their automated system took me down. So if you want a company that punishes first, doesn't listen when it's their innocent mistake, and then bends over backwards to blame you... Siteground is the place to go. Congrat on blaming again Siteground... Enjoy your hubris. Tell everyone again how it was my fault..."

In the meanwhile the site is offline. Siteground mentions: they do this in order to protect other customers which are on the same server. We even had a Go Geek server.

Just complete radio silence.Which is hardly surprising as I've been speaking to some guy there at SiteGround and I've seen less slippery eels.I'm sure there'll be a reply on here about blah blah blah (while they try to make it look like I am somehow in the wrong), but the facts are I could include the email trail here, and the abject lack of offer of a refund on the outrageous pricing for what I needed. The chat rep originally said I was paying way more than I needed to, and yet nothing was done.So I'll take this further, but I can't wait to see the response here about how you offered amazing value for the service, or some other excuse.Well, the facts are a company is based on how it deals with its complaints, and here you've been evasive, deliberately incompetent, and absolutely refusing to refund me, over the past 11 months.OK. I'm dying to see your public response.TLDR: Customer Service is everything.Update: Exactly as promised. They said nothing in that message (did you see?). They have ignored my last few emails to them. Because it's more important to focus on obtaining positive reviews from brand new customers than it is in providing positive support to existing customers. Just like they ignored my requests to cancel my subscription when I found it it was over \u00a3280 a year (to host emails).They insultingly actually offered me a discount on another year's membership. Still massively overpriced, so there you go. Thanks but I'll go with Hostinger instead."

I know other companies work this way, but a company I could trust would be the one that stood apart from that tactic, especially when the monthly price is more than THREE TIMES as much!"

Then they will take me through a lengthy (but always very respectful and helpful) process of refunding me any billed items I didn't approve.

Stuck with them to avoid the hassle of moving all 30 websites, however absolutely shocked to find out the cost of adding additional storage space onto cloud hosting plans. Siteground charge \u00a33.60/month/10gb and by comparison Google Drive is \u00a37.99/month/2TB (equivalent to 4p/10gb/month) making Siteground over  90x more expensive for online storage space. For a basic 100gb extra it would increase hosting to \u00a3108/month. Called up Siteground to check that this is not an error on their part, and was told that if I didn't want to pay over 90x for storage space then I should leave immediately. Not really how you expect to be spoken to after spending over \u00a32000 with them since joining. Would strongly recommend to seriously consider other hosting providers if you plan on scaling, otherwise you'll be stuck paying ludicrous prices.

Cleaned my database and tables and optimised it only two months ago according to their instructions but still throwing 502 errors. They told me it's because of these ip addresses accessing my website but it's still way under the limit of fair usage under their terms and also I checked those ip addresses and they are just your normal standard google crawlers and pininterest crawlers??? Your CPU limits my website just from normal bots ? My website isn't under attack, I'm well under the usage limits for a CLOUD server and yet the response I get is useless!!! I will be switching hosts if you don't fix this ."

I have had to generate a new .url, which affects his business, until Siteground gets aroudn to sending an EPP code to my client, which they refuse to do.  I have had to use my valuable time to work around this critical .url problem by redirecting our new (third) .url to the Siteground hosted .url, and they dismantled that redirect DNS on purpose, so now all instances of the site are down.  I should add that my client is in the security and protection industry.  This is not an eCommerce site, but a CRITICAL service.  I have no idea where Siteground gets the nerve to continually blow him off and hold his .url hostage to try and keep him as a customer.  Youd think they would be somewhat intimidated, or at least respectful.  This is a man with a business that saves lives, and a site thay took 4 months to complete.  Siteground is an absolutely corrupt company with appalling conduct.  This has been going on for a year before I even came on board as a site designer, so there is nothing they can say.  To SiteGground: Release my clients .url within 24 hours or I will contact the BBB, The Bureau of Consumer Protection, and every regulatory agency at my disposal on behalf of my client."

And of course something that is never mentioned in the pricing/features. So after am done transferring 15 websites and spending countless hours on this, am faced with this limitation. And this is something that you cant do anything about. So at the 10th of month all my websites are down and i get a message that they will be up at the end of month. At least with bandwidth you have a metric that you can deal with and do something to fix the issue, like optimizing images, or assigning more bandwidth to the problematic website. Maybe you should take a look at what your competitors are doing(hostgator). When a website reaches the bandwidth limit on a reseller account, that one only goes down, and then you can assign more bandwidth to it in order to bring it back up. With your microseconds policy i cant do anything to resolve this. My websites are kept hostage, and the only solution is to pay more in order to upgrade my account. Really disappointed"

Great discount to start with to web you in and all very nicey nicey customer service. Then once you are in you might lose your website! I lost a website that I had for 10 years to this shabby lot. Their main scam in 2023 is to make its existing customers and the new ones buy into their bigger plan because they actually do not give you enough space for the current website. Look at their advertising campaign and you'll get the idea. They'll entice you like the snake from adam apple with great hosting cheap plans, but, they come with limited space. Leaving the only way to safeguard your website is to buy into their upgrade. You'll know what I mean if you join. I am going back to Bluehost they have everything under control there. I'll pay more. At least I won't lose a \u00a31000 Plus website. I am writing this because the same thing is happening with website No 2! It's a whole mess. I do not have time to lose over it. However, time and more money are lost. If's it too good to be true, see a BIG RED FLAG. I'm very disappointed and frustrated with Siteground. Keep your site away from this ground. They will grind you down. Your choice! Do not say, I did not warn you!"

We were on the GrowBig plan with four sites at only 4-5GB of space used of the 20GB allowed.Issue 1: We ran into a db problem trying to setup an Amazon Affiliate store... too many items in the db, which caused us to hit a limit and the site got throttled.  Had to request a 1-time exception without upgrading to get the db below it's site restriction.  Scraped those plans because the host plan couldn't support it... moved to another host.Issue 2: We have another site which pulls in data.  All sites were only using 3-4GB of space; however, SG keep saying we were at our 20GB max and throttled our site.  When the site gets throttled, you lose access to a lot of site tools (other than File Manager) to make SLOW file changes.  If you don't have SSH/FTP accounts setup prior, you can't create them after the throttle is in place to fix stuff.  Anyway, did a chat with tier-1... they in-turn did a ticket to advanced support (tier-2), who in-turn... basically stated that we are at 20 of 20GB... need to upgrade.  Okay, I spent another $300 to upgrade.  Called support (tier-1) back... only to get a better tech, who advised that our TEMP space was taking up 17GB of space and the only way to clear it was via SSH, which is why we couldn't see the usage via the SG web console.  We deleted all the temp files... space return to the normal 3-4GB of usage.  So, now the problem was fixed, didn't need to upgrade to the 40GB of storage... lets downgrade the plan back to 20GB.  NO refund... money spent gets assigned to the current plan, which extended our term by 1-year.  The only way to get a refund is to cancel the account.  Okay... migration in process.3. When we moved our sites over to SG, we also moved our domains to \"SiteGround\"... didn't realize that SG partners with Tucows (horrible domain registrar; go read those reviews)... so now, we are at risk of losing our refund (by cancelling within 30-days)... because our domains haven't transferred out.- I'll defiantly give the tier-1 folks at SG some credit for responding within 5-mins; however, this crap of upgrade, oh, you really didn't need to, but we can't give a refund... you have to cancel to get it... major crap.Win/Win, it looks like being forced to find another web host (Host-----.com) provider may be working out to our benefit.  We might be paying a little more; however, we are getting Cloud Hosting (Cloud Startup) for 4-years, 200GB SSD, Unlimited BW, 3GB RAM."

Their \"Support\" is essentially a grift to always have you upgrade to a higher-paying service. They do not allow you to back up your emails in bulk. The system they use allows you to only backup one email received at a time. Meaning if you have 1000 emails, you will click and export 1000x to back them up and then click and Import 1000x. Also, if you are hosting multiple websites on a bulk hosting account PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM STEGROUND. You will end up with 40 GB of space but you will only use about 12 GB of it as they use a made-up INODES policy which runs up fast on your account thus preventing you from using the rest of your 28GB. They are not really giving you 40GB as they promised. They use INODES to force you to keep signing up for higher services. Siteground is the most notorious grifting platform and provider we have ever used. We are moving away by the end of 2023. I have all the transcripts of how they confidently grift you and feel justified doing it. STAY AWAY if you have multiple websites you are hosting. You will REGRET IT!"

          "Contenu": "I want to express my deep regret over recommending SiteGround as the hosting provider for my client's project. The experience we've had has been disappointing and has significantly impacted the project's development.The main issue we've faced is SiteGround's incompatibility with PHP 8.1 in the Command Line Interface (CLI) environment. This limitation has created a series of obstacles that have prevented us from using essential tools such as Composer and WP CLI with Continuous Deployment (CD). The inability to work with PHP 8.1 in CLI has slowed down development, affected the team's productivity, and resulted in considerable dissatisfaction from my client.Despite opening several support tickets, SiteGround has been unable to provide a satisfactory solution to this technical limitation. The support team has been slow to respond and, unfortunately, has not offered an option to select the PHP version in CLI that we need for the project.The negative impact of this situation has been significant, and regrettably, I am now responsible for covering the cost of a year's hosting with Webdock.io as we will be migrating the project to their platform. Despite being a costly decision, it is necessary to ensure that the project progresses effectively and meets my client's needs.In contrast to SiteGround, I have had a more positive experience with Webdock.io. Their team has shown a proactive approach and provided effective technical support that has helped resolve the issues we encountered. The ability to work with PHP 8.1 in CLI has been crucial in improving team productivity and recovering the lost time due to the previous technical limitations.In conclusion, my experience with SiteGround has been disheartening, and I deeply regret recommending them for my client's project. The incompatibility with PHP 8.1 in CLI and the lack of effective solutions from the support team have negatively impacted the project's development and generated dissatisfaction for both myself and my client. The migration to Webdock.io was a necessary, albeit costly, decision, but it has proven to be a more suitable and reliable solution for our technical needs. Moving forward, I will be more cautious when recommending hosting providers and ensure they can adequately meet the specific technical requirements of each project before making any recommendations."

ORIGINAL POST: Renewal Fee with Siteground has increased horrendously and Help Centre is nightmare to get hold of. Fee increase is sent by a no-reply email making it extraordinarily difficult for a customer to obtain support. And before Siteground go to Trustpilot to suggest this is not a real review - it is a genuine experience.Siteground needs to become far more customer centric and make it much easier for paying customers to speak to someone. I just want someone from billing to contact me or for me to be able to contact them."

The Wordpress Migrator did not work. The Email Migrator is hit and miss; it mostly does not work.When setting up a domain be VERY careful about what server location you select. That needs to be done via a tiny pull down button at the top the set up page. If you don't see that, changing that will cost you $7.99 - too bad so sad, \"nothing we can do about that\"Be clear that SiteGround will only transfer one site from another provider. Consider that when transferring from elsewhere. I knew that, asked about it, but was told it the automated WP transfer works 99% of the time. For me it DID NOT work 100% of the time.Attempting to get assistance is an exercise in frustration. Firstly one needs to navigate through a sequence of bot driven pages before finding a link to real person. Secondly, the first line staff, whether on the phone (my very latest experience) or chat appear to be trained to do the following: 1) leave the chat ASAP - one needs to beg them, repeatedly to stay online (& they still often will not) 2) direct you one or another of SG's help pages (as the bots do), in other words to make service a DIY experience 3) act as a praetorian guard: do what they can to NOT move issues to a senior (more competent level of support).I've given a 2 star instead of 1 star review as, once you get through to the senior level of support the assistance is much improved."

I didn't even expect to be billed, and was very disappointed that they just were not at all willing to refund the full amount.This seems like terrible customer service, unfair and tells me that their commitment is to their policy, not to the customers.I won't be in a hurry to recommend or use them again. This will loose them much more than it lost me. For the \u00a330 to complete the refund, they could have had many recommendations.Sad times.- Update -Thanks SiteGround for showing understanding after this review and contacting your compliance team. I only wish I hadn\u2019t had to spend so much time on this."

They always say the solution is Sucuri? A $199.99/year which costs more than my hosting plan. That is not ok. Siteground should be the one resolving this for free with the service plan I pay for yearly. Yesterday, I updated my plugins and my website FINALLY is working, so relieved! So I updated the customer service then \u201csuddenly\u201d after a few hours later it is not working again. It is already fine after the update and then becomes unavailable again?? I\u2019m feeling there is something going on just for me to spend more by using  Sucuri that they are offering."

          "Contenu": "Dear SiteGround Hosting Support Team,I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the automatic renewal process that was recently applied to my hosting account. I find the process to be unclear and misleading, which has resulted in an unexpected renewal charge on my account.I was not aware that my hosting account would automatically renew, and I was not given clear instructions on how to opt-out of the automatic renewal process. Additionally, the renewal charge was significantly higher than the original cost of the hosting package, which has caused a financial burden for me.I would like to request a full refund for the automatic renewal charge, as I was not informed of this process and did not intend to renew my hosting account at this time. I believe that SiteGround Hosting should make the automatic renewal process more transparent and provide customers with clear instructions on how to opt-out if they do not wish to renew their hosting account.I look forward to hearing from you soon and hope that we can resolve this issue quickly and amicably.Sincerely,Will"

I have been with SiteGround since August 2022 and my website was running well then over the past 48 hours SiteGround disconnected my website from Google Domains and didn't even tell me. I had to discover it myself. I reached out via Chat and the first customer service person was very rude and even mansplained things to me that I already knew and was sharing with him because I needed help fixing their mistake. He didn't take responsibility for SiteGround's mistake or even acknowledged it nor did he acknowledge that I am a customer who has been with them for quite some time and the directions he provided were unhelpful and not at all fixing the issue. He kept telling me to contact Google support (which we all know Google doesn't have), but this wasn't a Google Domain issue as everything else in my Google Business was running just fine. This was a SiteGround issue that they were not willing to fix or take responsibility for. I ended up having to go on YouTube to figure out part of it then came back to SiteGround and thankfully was able to chat with someone else who was then helpful and patient as we had to reset my entire SiteGround website. I am a business owner who happens to be a woman. SiteGround very much seems to hire white men which is fine for them, but after today's experience, I am looking for a website host with a more diverse and professional staff who seeks solutions rather than sexist mansplaining and unhelpful feedback with no solutions. This was poor and disappointing, and as a customer, I deserved better."

They had a perfect opportunity to offer a better solution and didn't. So we have found another provider that did offer a better solution and are in the process of leaving Siteground today.

The customer service took over 90 minutes to respond to the issue, and after both times they revealed that the issue was caused by a misconfigured PHP thing on their side. I am especially disappointed that this happened two times. Furthermore, the sitespeed was not satisfying at all and moving to a CDN was very difficult. Furthermore i had to pay close to 100\u20ac a month for their \"cloud hosting\". I did at least expect a solid performance for that price. After leaving Siteground, i know now that there are other hosting providers that deliver a far better experience (cheaper service, faster website)."

Fine - that sucks but we'll continue using it because otherwise it's a great service. Then I asked if the WP Backup and WP Staging was also only included with 1 website, as they are also \"singular\" which was the argument for the Free WP Transfer.

He replied by sending me a link to a page I had already visited several times. That was not a good start. It took me at least five minutes to get him to start explaining to me what needed to be done. Once we got to that point, his directions were vague, and he rather bluntly \"corrected\" me for not doing things that were not included in his instructions. We finally got it done, but I did not appreciate his \"corrections\" when either better online resources or more responsive and skillful customer service would have resolved the issue in about 90 seconds.  Prior to the online chat, I had been debating whether or not to renew my  Is hosting service with Siteground. After that unpleasant interaction, I decided to allow it to lapse, as it now has.

          "Contenu": "I am writing this in early 2021, the pandemic and my web-design business has struggled hard to stay afloat this year.So, let's get to the point:  Overall, I was happy with Siteground, their service is up with the best, good hosting service with reliable speeds globally.   BUT, the big but, is, that despite the aforementioned virtue, I have to say I was left indignant when upon renewal I was expected to pay 3 times what I originally signed up for. Especially, when pleading to support for some economic leverage in the face of their 3x ramp-up and all I was told was that this was their business model, and I should read the fine print better.  Like words straight from a lawyer without a soul. This to be frank, is a stupid and suicidal business model; I much like others, would be more likely to return to a service provider that service was not so good a few years later under the promise of improving than return to a company that previously had treated their customers in a sly and untrustworthy manner.  Trust is hard to earn and virtually impossible to regain once lost. I would have been happier to have gone in at 3 times the price and not have an unpleasant surprise at the end of the first year and the aggravation to migrate to another host with a better reputation of ethics.Which motivated me to search elsewhere to migrate to another service provider which is more transparent about their fees."

          "Contenu": "I\u2019ve been a customer of SiteGround for around 4 years, so I think I\u2019m well placed to leave an honest review of their company. At first their customer service was great and I couldn\u2019t fault them, but in the last year I\u2019ve noticed a shift in this. Sometimes I\u2019ve been put through to individuals that are probably new and therefore don\u2019t have the knowledge. They\u2019ve also made changes to their dashboard which makes it harder to find the live chat/contact part (only a small thing, but it\u2019s annoying nonetheless). But for me, the biggest issue I have is the cost to value ratio. I work in digital marketing, so I\u2019m aware of the costs for other hosting companies. When I first joined SiteGround it was okay, I was on the basic package. But as I started increasing the amount of websites I was hosting with them I had to move up the different packages. I know that I can move elsewhere and pay less money and get the same level of service, hence why I\u2019m looking to leave. When I mentioned to SiteGround about issues with live chat and cost etc they pretty much give a shrug of the shoulders. In addition to this I\u2019ve referred a number of clients and friends to their platform - not anymore. I think they\u2019ve forgot the one thing that set them apart from the other hosting companies out there - customer service and customer loyalty. Why should you pay more when you can get the same service for less elsewhere - and they won\u2019t restrict the live chat either."

That is what I'm trying to do: update very popular plugins, one at the time, in two low-traffic WordPress installations with very few plugins. This should be basic stuff... but no, not anymore. Now I need more CPUs.I've never experienced any issues in the last years. Now, all of a sudden, I can't do the most basic stuff inside WordPress because my Cloud plan does not have enough CPUs to manage a plugin update. So it's either the performance drop of a Cloud account is so bad that it can't handle basic maintenance in two low-traffic Wordpress installations or the support team doesn't have the time or interest to investigate the problem."

During the years they have helped me on several occasions and surely I thank them for that. Since about 1 month, since when they have switched to the NEW USERAREA, my life as webmaster become incredibly sad and difficult. Their website is slow, to be able to access the cPanels I need to click 4/5 times, often I am not able to open a ticket and their system forces me to go to the live chat, and wait 20/30 minutes, whereas a ticket could have been openen quickly and their support respond later. Now on several occasions I see their Spam Experts IPs cause emails to not be delivered. Sometimes I ask to a Paypal link and they send me the wrong link amount. I still think they have a great hardware/software infrastructure, however they have lowered dramatically their standards. Whoever released the new userarea though more about the coolness of the design, rather than how a webmaster with hundreds of services could use their tools. Another sign of LACK OF CARE is that when I communicated multiple times some bugs in their user area (i.e. you cannot attach images to a ticket - the url after a Paypal payment is a non existent url) they completely ignored my communication, and even the Facebook message told me that I had to open a ticket. This is so sad! Surely the pandemic issue has caused their staff to not be well monitored, however I suspect there is something bigger at the bottom of this company that once was great."

          "Contenu": "Siteground used to be great, and I recommended their support to anyone. But now they have limited my support saying I overuse it (Last month did support 6 times because of quarantine, other than that it is about 1x per month). I am paying for \"priority support\", am receiving terrible support, don't get the \"24/7\" support anymore, and am treated terribly. I have raised tickets asking about this and they just shut it down. I understand everyone is having issues with the times right now, but now is not the time to provide terrible support to your customers who have been with you for over 5 years (and pay for their hosting 3 years in advance, and was going to upgrade to higher cloud hosting).Edit (4.21.2020): With chatting with Siteground, there has been a lot of unresolved responses in regards to this. Almost all communication with their support has been in regards to issues with their staging area, domain assistance such as bought domains not showing up on the backend and tech support had to do stuff on their end, wrong domains showing up in my staging area, and migration questions. So almost all communications was within their scope as a host. They removed the ability for me to have live chats, so now I have to wait hours (up to 12+ hours) for a response with \"priority support\". Both of my tickets I opened in regards to these changes have been closed on their end with no chance of reply from me, so I have to open up a new ticket (which apparently hits my account again for \"too much support requests\") to continue the conversation. Siteground used to be amazing, and maybe they will be again some day, but right now their support has been less than ideal, especially for \"priority support\"."

I think it is only logical that a new customer has to do a lot of finetuning in the first month to get everything right. I had tried their cloudflare integration but this slowed down my site so i had to undo this unfortunately. Then i tried rocket cdn integration but this also slowed down my site so i just ditched the cdn. My website is still pretty fast so no problem there.Unfortunately i had a lot of questions concearning that cdn change. Then there was a problem with my emails going to spam. (turned out they were not getting proper d mark settings from sitegrounds end) I had a lot of questions but they were all hosting related.A week ago i had a new question because i wanted to park a .de domain but i could not buy it at siteground so i wanted to buy it somewhere else and move it to siteground. There is no documentation if this is possible so again i have a hosting related question and wanted to ask someone.I found they had blocked my livechat because i asked to many questions and appearently:\"We change the support flow for users who tend to post exceedingly more than the average rate of all clients to improve efficiency. As this rate is dynamic we can not tell at this point when your standard support flow will be restored. Still, you are welcome to post any service-related issue through the special forms.\"This basicly means eventhough they promised me unlimited livechat 24/7 before i paid. Since i asked to many HOSTING RELATED questions my livechat has been cancelled for an unknow time....This is ridiculous if you ask me. If you promise something you should honer that promise. I would have never moved if i knew they would do this. If you value livechat support like i do think twice about moving your site to siteground.Kind regards,Dominic"

The staff are all courteous and reply quickly to queries.Be that as it may, I decided to cancel (thankful for the 30-day refund) due to SiteGround\u2019s inflexible attitude and lack of adaptability to my specific needs. I simply wanted an email host, with a domain name \"pointer\" to a Wix site - easy. At first it all seemed to be wonderful. But soon after I signed up, I was disappointed with the apparent unwillingness to accomodate a simple and modest requirement of 10-12 GB for my main email account (I only have a few email accounts) with up to a maximum of about 15 GB in total, well within the limits of their data plan.I was told during the initial online chat with a SiteGround sales consultant, that I could indeed have up to 20 GB for my emails (given the zero data usage requirement for my website, out-sourced on WIX.com). Having been persuaded to sign up in order to receive tutorials and more specific information about the Site Tools and functionality etc. It was only after signing up and getting tech support that I learned about a strict 4GB limit per email account, and that a new \"upgrade\" plan would be needed to facilitate my email storage requirement. The suggested plan was ludicrously expensive and utterly disproportionate for my requirement, as a sole trader working with only two other full-time team-members.I am sorry the deal went sour over such a small thing, and hopefully SiteGround will learn from this as much as I have; full disclosure and transparency up front is better. I have certainly learned to be more careful and ask more questions in future, before I sign up to a new web hosting service."

          "Contenu": "We have switched since September 2016. We took the GoGeek plan and was unpleasantly surprised with the limitations of the unlimited plan. The CPU and memory usages are limited (per moment, per 2 hours, per 24hrs etc). They give you penalties by shutting your site down for the public if you exceed, or if the issue maintains they ask you to fix it before THEY make it live again. We have twice a Wordpress update, but that 'broke' our site and it pushed the CPU/memory to the limit. Once this update was initiated by Siteground themselves, but they still lock your domain. So this policy is clear. While the support is GREAT! Having the site down because they lock your site, is not a great UPtime experience. Especially if they don't specify the limitations when selling you this package before you purchase there services.EDIT: Response of siteground. The link you provided, I could not find the server section which details the CPU restrictions. But I tried to google it, but no luck either. I did find this other user encounter the same issue. I am not trying to say it is unfair, it is just something people need to know when they sign up for your. Article at shoutemeloud dot com/siteground-hosting-cons.html (replace DOT with .)EDIT 2 - 24 Aug 2017 after Siteground's update: Thanks for the clarification where to find these fine prints, was not straightforward. And it took me a while to find this page (comparison of all the packages) myself from your website! While some of the limitations are clear, the biggest issue that shut our site down was the CPU seconds. That pages clearly defines that we can only use X seconds per day/week etc, but I guess we are just unlucky to be assigned a very slow CPU. Without defining what CPU, every user might have a different experience at Siteground. And I guess unfortunately, we were maxed out and got shut down twice until we did a rapid change to our website. (Also for your reference, you can identify us by Invoice 36595, paid 23 September 2016). Please confirm we are a genuine customer!"

          "Contenu": "I have used a number of hosting companies as I am a graphic designer with IT qualifications, & design websites for clients. I chose Siteground after doing research online about the best hosting companies. I wanted a company with good customer support & they often fair well in this area. Unfortunately this has not been my experience. I have had 3 issues requiring tech support since joining Siteground (SG) 15 months ago. I have been dissatisfied will each support experience. Last week I needed to update an SSL certificate on a website for a client, the support staff were not only rude & unhelpful but I was given the wrong advice, I wrote back to SG asking for assistance but their help ultimately made the site offline for 5 hours. Once the site was back online it was damaged beyond belief. Instead of trying to assist, the support guy told me off for not 'creating a new ticket' even though it was his support that broke the site. That night after many hours of my time and a little help from SG, the site was finally up & running again. The next morning I checked the site again & IT WAS REDIRECTED TO SOMEONE ELSE'S WEBSITE. That's right folks, the URL was sending all the websites visitors to someone else's website. I contacted Siteground (after being told to start a new ticket ) & was told it wasn't their issue. I spent another few hours of my time & fixed the problem myself. A few hours later I was notified by the same client that her email was not working. I tried reconfiguring the settings myself but kept getting errors, (back to Siteground I go) I was told that what SG did the day before could not have possibly caused the email issue (!) Once again I was waiting for them to fix it from their end. I have the top SG plan, pay a lot for the service (or lack thereof). I am supposed to have whiz bang support as part of my package. I am currently researching a new hosting provider.  I have been disappointed up until now but I think the events of the last 36 hours mean I cannot possibly continue with Siteground."

          "Contenu": "I recently decided to transition away from Siteground hosting, and I believe it's essential to provide constructive feedback based on my experience.My primary concern, constituting 60% of my decision, revolves around the customer support offered by Siteground. I noticed that their support tended to quickly attribute issues to themes or plugins. The recurring suggestion to opt for paid developer support or the provision of URL links to articles I had already explored became a somewhat predictable response. Unfortunately, the quality of customer support, once outstanding, seems to have considerably diminished over time.The remaining 40% of my decision is linked to value for money. Despite the initial excellence in customer support, Siteground's continuous price increases, combined with a reduction in service quality, ultimately led me to explore alternative hosting solutions. Affordability played a pivotal role in my decision-making process.In the past, Siteground was considered an industry leader in service, but this is no longer the case. Consequently, I chose to migrate to a different hosting provider that aligns more closely with my current needs and expectations.Site speed issues and Time To First Byte (TTFB) delays, consistently attributed to website themes and plugins, miraculously resolved upon migrating to my new host. Even in the early stages of setting up the cache systems, my sites are already performing significantly faster. This revelation suggests that the performance challenges were, in fact, rooted in Siteground's hosting infrastructure after all.In conclusion, my decision to switch hosting providers was driven by a combination of diminishing customer support quality, escalating prices, and the discovery that the performance issues I experienced were tied to Siteground's hosting environment. As a user seeking a reliable and cost-effective solution, I found a more suitable host that better aligns with my current expectations."

          "Contenu": "It's a great hosting platform because it is easy to use with a lot of features. Unfortunately, they are deceptive about their renewals by saying they are set to expire, when in fact they are set to renew. Even logging onto the platform to confirm your service will not renew is confusing because it clearly states at the top, 'service set to expire on X Date.' Customer service refuses to refund you after they charge your credit card for something you'd already confirmed was set to expire. I don't like deceitful marketing. If you have a good product, you shouldn't have to deceive people to renew it."

You have to get an unmanaged dedicated server to enable it. That's pretty ridiculous considering it's a pretty standard image format that's been enable-able in PHP GD since 2012 (and with its current flag since 2015). I've not come across a hosting provider (except super budget ones like 97cents) that didn't have this enabled or enable-able (even GoDaddy has it enabled...) oh well."

L2 were the culprits. Not responding to a customer is a quite poor service experience."

I am no expert in this but what i was assured was an easy process has turned into both a headache and a worry. Im giving them a couple of hours more to see if once  (if) it is up and running it is easier to deal with. It worries me as these guys are rated highest for service and thats why i started to move over. Will update this is it gets better, but not hugely hopeful at the moment. it feels like they have expanded quickly and havent caught up yet.update, the did refund, same day actually, so if you want to give them a go I hope more luck than me.

          "Contenu": "Support attendant was fine and cordial. Although he couldn't fix my problem, he passed it on to a senior support agent. I have given Siteground 5 stars in the past but I am highly disappointed now that they have discontinued support of the wonderful Joomla tools they used to have, moved from CPanel and gone to their own thing. I am getting ready to move around 10 sites from Siteground hosting even though we aren't up for renewal. It has gotten increasingly more difficult to get in touch with a tech support agent because they run you through a hundred questions first instead of simply being able to get to the chat button easily. Siteground WAS an excellent host, but now their \"improvements\" are sending me elsewhere. Their migration to their tools caused a huge glitch in one of my sites. I understand there can be problems with any new advancement working out the bugs, but  the fact that they have removed all the extra Joomla tools is the nail in the coffin. They have prioritized Wordpress and pretty much abandoned Joomla - other than simple installation. If you use Wordpress, you're probably good. But for those of us who use Joomla and enjoyed the auto-updater and other features.... I guess it's time to move on."

          "Contenu": "I'm not a web developer... so I discovered that WordPress has a bit of learning curve. In August of 2021, I paid for a full year of SiteGround's hosting service. Unfortunately, I've not been able to utilize it because I've been very ill - no energy & focused brain power learn WP and been unable to even start on my site, I intended to start 6 months ago. I need a simple, no-brainer solution, so decided to use GoDaddy's menu-based site builder... (a.k.a. Website building for Dummies). LOL  I asked SiteGround if they'd be willing to give me a partial refund for the hosting service I've never used... I only asked for a refund for 6 months, but they were unwilling to give me even a partial refund even though I've never used it.  I realize they have their \"policies\", however there are always exceptions. I've worked in the corporate world for over 25 years... there's ALWAYS an exception to any policy. Written policies are mere guidelines for staff without the authority to make 'outside of policy' decisions. On the other hand, SiteGround's chat response was fast and efficient... I give them 5 stars for that.. and the online chat rep (Silvia V.) was superb!  So, I'm going to write a letter to the COO and CEO... not expecting a refund, but suggesting they empower their staff to make 'outside of policy' decisions for customers... then, maybe they'd attain an overall rating of 5 stars."

Today its auto responders not working issue there end. i just hope that once sites are all fixed there wont be ongoing issues. Because i am quite happy with the backend layout its well thought out and has some great features if i didn't have so many basic issues while setting up i wouldnt of had a bad word to say as everything else seems pretty good"

I am giving 3 stars only because of previous positive experience.  Recent issues are overpowering my positive experience with Siteground. They suddently took away live chat and call support from me. I do not know if I will ever get live chat support ever again. I was informed that I use their chat feature too much because on non relevant issues. Since it is not safe to share ticket ID I will describe my last 5 issues. (1 being very recent and 5 is the oldest).1.  I have renewed some services, payment was deducted but nothing is renewed. Got no email. My ticket is still open and pending for someone to solve for over 12 hours. 2. Service renewed but got no confirmation email (They said there was a problem on their end).3. Found a missing feature in system that they said was there (They informed me they are working on it, I got no appreciation or a thank you out of courtesy for finding it). 4. Website was suddenly loading slowly without making any changes. It got automatically fixed even before their response.  5. My Siteground account design and everything suddenly got changed. So I contacted live chat (You can call it non service issue). Later I found out they have changed the look of all of their user accounts. I do not know if these are non service issues. I had zero complains about hosting speed and performance but this recent changes and sudden issues, live chat ban and slow ticket response is making me uncomfortable. I still do not plan moving my website as Siteground served me well past two years. I just do not know if I still am going to face issues in future. I am clueless now."

Until now, their support was exceptional. That's probably the reason why Siteground is so famous now, their support was perfect, live chat for the general issues, ticket for the complicated issues (their support guru are just super smart).Since few months it seems they hired a lot of new support persons but unfortunately the difference of quality between the \"Guru\" and the \"Newbie\" (as they called them) is just HUGE. Every time I had to deal with one of the Newbie, my problem was not solved or the information they gave me was even sometimes just inexact and the opposite of what the support guru told me. They had to take back my ticket and reply again.I tried to talk with your senior manager about this issue but I've never got any responses from my feedback, hopefully a public feedback will make things move because this new support is just killing the reputation of Siteground. You set your standards so high since a lot of years, I never thought I will one day have to write this.Still, if you're from a \"normal hosting company\", you will love siteground, their great quality of hosting and their support that has still, for the moment, a step ahead the other hosting providers.But please Siteground, do something about it :)Ps: If things improve, I will be happy to update my review to 5 stars!"

After a lot of research and a promise of processes being simple, I have paid money for Gogeek (top level for WP hosting) and tried to connect my very first domain and cannot even log in to my WP admin panel. I was told last night that there was an issue and that the domain team would be given 'a bit of a push'. I\u2019d receive an email when things had been resolved. I wake up this morning- no email, no progress.After 1 HOUR on chat with someone this morning, no answers. No domain connected. No WP admin. Guess what? I was told that they would give the domain team a bit of a push! I have been told there is an isue with my domain but trying to get an answer as to what this issue is or trying to speak with the domain team is as frustrating as it gets. I have set up and connected hundreds of websites and domains over my years as a website designer and never have I had this level of delay or confusion. It does not take this long to set up a Wordpress website. It is a 5 minute job. It should not need a team to take over 12 hours to resolve this. I cannot accept this SLA and neither will my clients.So I now have to wait up to 48hrs from registering domain to get an answer from Sitegrounds mysterious domain team and I have to wait 5 business days (so a whole week) for this complaint to go through. Which is completely useless for my situation right now. So this is my experience with Siteground so far. Not a good experience.Edit : I\u2019m amending this review as the situation has now been resolved. Whilst it doesn\u2019t give me the domain name that I need, technical issues do happen. I cannot blame Siteground for this. I do feel that I could have been updated slightly quicker than I was though."

          "Contenu": "Whilst on the shared GoGeek plan our website worked like a dream.However, our website is busy and we started to hit some service limits. Rather than inform us of this in advance so we could look at upgrading etc, they simply pulled the site. That's right, no notice, they just started serving a blank page and we got an email saying we were using too much CPU time on the shared system.We rapidly upgraded to a CLOUD based virtual server, and initially, for the first few days we were happy but then we started to get hit with regular (4-5 times a day) periods of downtime related to 500/502/504 errors.We spent a lot of time and money to massively optimise every aspect of the website, we massively upgraded the server to 12 CPU cores and additional ram, however, several months later this is still an ongoing issue.We have reached out to support over 50 times regarding this and each time they send us on another wild goose chase saying it's due to our site, cache or plugins and lately telling us our database is to blame.After researching the issue further I've found a LOT of other people having issues with their bigger plans and virtual/dedicated servers. They are simply unstable and not up to the task of hosting anything other than a pretty basic Wordpress website. We peak at around 75-100 active users at any one time and the crazy thing is, when the website is at it's busiest it can be performing perfectly fine, yet at times when the site is relatively quiet it is plagued with 500/502/504 errors and page load times of 30-45 seconds or worse.I'm currently researching other hosts and I write this review as a warning to others. Don't believe the hype. I'm not blown away by the service or the customer support and moving to siteground has caused irreparable damage to our business reputation and cost us thousands in lost revenue."

          "Contenu": "I have hired them for more than 5 years .. They are an excellent company. I have 2 GROWBIG plans of 480usd each a year with 50 sites between both plans. Today I just found out that for the same money they offered unlimited websites, they are now limiting it to 5 sites (for new customers). I asked them if they plan to limit my current plans in the future and they answered that they will not do it now, but eventually they will, of course letting me know in advance. It means that at some point they will \"force\" me to contract 10 plans of 480usd to maintain the same number of sites. THEY ARE CRAZY. Changing the quantity from unlimited to 5 and charging the same price, is ridiculous. I'm not renewing with them. Shame for them. They will lose a lot of customers, but it seems they know that and they don't care.EDIT after their answer: The operator explained everything perfectly. It's not her fault. Im just annoyed as how you changed from unlimited to 5 sites for the same price. I understand you are not planning to do it now, but I'm sure you will eventually force all your actual customers to migrate to new type of plan, and that means contract more plans to fit all my actual websites. Also if I want to contract new plan it's so much expensive, you force me to contract in a new hosting provider because no one can afford such craziness in price. And it makes no sense to me to have multiple hosting providers. I prefer to have all my websites in the same one. I was planning to renew for 3 years because of discount, but this kind of decision from your side gives me no trust for the future, so I prefer to not renew now, before you ask your customers in a gently manner to contract new plans to fit all their websites. You think you are the best, but you will lose so many customers this way, and you don`t care. No sir. Thanks. I prefer to leave now before it's too late.EDIT2: After my post they changed the limit of 5 websites to 10. Good decision."

          "Contenu": "Update 11/16/22: I've raised it up a few stars, but ultimately, I still don't feel my issues were completely addressed as I don't see the amounts paid in returned to me. I have used Siteground since 2015, and was happy with them most of the time out of the past 7 years. There have been a few issues, some I've addressed below, but for the most part, I would rank them as one of the best hosting companies. The issue I have is that when it's bad, it's really bad. For example, at one point they moved cloud hosting services and caused a bunch of slowdowns for all of my websites, and they didn't fix it until I contacted them multiple times and finally a tech figured out it out and fixed it. Another time, they removed my ability to chat with support, apparently because of the number of times I had used chat due to issues. So I'm paying for tech support, and am having issues (over 50 websites there, of course there will be issues) and in response they remove my ability to chat with support. Lastly, I had paid and was given a credit to the account but never seen that go back on my credit card. When I cancelled, I asked about this and didn't get a clear answer. Ultimately, there were a few frustrating experiences with siteground. I still find them better than most other hosting companies, I just think the service is spotty considering some of the issues I've had.Update: had issues, canceled, and they would not refund despite having 7 months of service left, and said that there was nothing they could do. Siteground was excellent my first 5 years of using them, but as of 2020, they have continued to go downhill. I have regular downtime with multiple clients, they never have an explanation for it, and despite paying for many addons, I can't even see them in the back end management tool anymore, and it claims they are \"working on it.\" I have noticed a dramatic decrease in service, many issues, complaints from clients, and they act like there are no issues. I then spoke with a competitor/friend who uses their services, as well as a few clients who I am managing their accounts, and all of them are having the same issues. They take no responsibility and I have 7 months more of service which I paid quite a bit for and am looking to relocate elsewhere.They also no longer allow me to contact support via chat and essentially accused me of abuse of using their support system too much, but sure enough, I find multiple other reviews throughout the web showing they are doing the same to other customers. I'm not sure what happened, but they changed their business model and decided to change everything and I feel, as a long term customer, that I am being ripped off now. I definitely want to find another host and want my money for the next 6 months refunded.Update 8/4: Since my review, my customers are having more downtime and now all of a sudden, email is not working for customers and DNS info is changing on the server causing email problems even if my customers are using 3rd parties like gsuite or Outlook. All email forms use Google Recaptcha and is secured, yet now email configuration is not working, even sending email direct outside of a form. All of this has happened in the past few days since my reviews were posted. This is very concerning and causing massive issues with us and our clients.Update after response: The server was moved months ago, if there was a DNS issue, one I have complained about multiple times with websites going down over the past several months, why did your techs not notice it until now? Why weren't the old IPs not removed previously? At this time, I believe things are working better, but why did I have to go through all this to get you to look into it? This isn't just my issue, as I said, I not only manage other clients, but have friends who also do what I do, and some were using siteground based on my recomendation, and all of them are having issues as well. If this is an oversight, it should have been addressed and at bare minimal, we should have received an apology and private response. You didn't, the only way to get through was threatening legal action because my client was threatening to leave us because of the downtime, and to post reviews. That should not be the way to get through to a hosting company to get them to actually do something.UPDATE August 28th, 2020: They have improved the past month, I believe due to an error fixed in which they left old IPs connected to the account which was creating a lot of headaches, erros, slow servers, etc. This seems to have been resolved and their support has recently improved.  I will update again if this continues in this manner, in the meantime I upgraded from 1 star to 3, and will upgrade to 5 if the service remains the same over the next quarter."

I have it under control and now excited to accomplish what my vision has always been to bring Amazing Creatives together from Feature Films, Award winning Photographers, Architects Sound Techs Set Design Painters Famous Musicians. Making Podcasts question and answers Demos. Of course selling limited edition prints or Originals. With no Pomp or big words. Then giving access to kids, People who would bever be given the chance to hear them or have there work next to their own, even if they think they hate ART opening it up to them. Unfortunatly we have had so many set backs. Told you I had ADHD LOL i will get to the point. This guy was like Clint Eastwood, he did not know my problems. It what I like genuine patient knows his stuff. So I will continue with this  until more funds come in. As the Film Strike has affected alot of people. Even now its over people are not back at work. So thanks so much, you have helped without realizing it."

Weird tp say the least, but after a long process it seems to be rectified now.What does concern me as a very long time Siteground customer (since 2008) was the inference that its my issue when the theme came from the siteground library and has been in use since September 2008 without any issue. I also followed the recommendation last year by the siteground email to deploy the CleanTalk Security and Anti Spam plugins. I chose to pay for these plugins to have external support and functionality. The malware scanner within CleanTalk Security didn't alert on the same file as an issue.All in all a lot of work that didn't really help me, and forced the migration to a different theme that will now require many hours to make it function the way we require."

A basic function of cPanel is being able to migrate the whole of cPanel to a new host. Their \"custom backoffice\" obviously does not have the feature which makes the migration plugin fairly important. So I'm not happy with the premium I'm paying for a \"custom backoffice\" that certain basic functions do not work and require me to either pay them $30 per site to migrate them, or do it myself. I'm hoping the actual service overall will be better than my current host and make this frustration worth it."

          "Contenu": "The Siteground UI and support are excellent value for the price point. So much nicer to work with an interface that is modern,  simple, and straightforward. The 5th star could be awarded, given there was more support on the interrelationship between their caching and security plugins and other CDNs. I experienced many quite serious issues, and I felt the support/documentation could be greatly improved. After looking a bit deeper, I discovered that I am one of a lot of people who feel the same about this, and I hope this feedback will prompt the amazing Siteground team to work on a more productive way to help people configure these very problematic plugins. When I say problematic, I don't only mean what Siteground has developed but rather the complexities of the configuration of caching on the server level, file level, and CDN level. There are a lot of moving parts, and companies like Rocket and WP Engine do much better in proactively resolving any performance/security issues that come up. Essentially, on SIteground, although I got a lot of info during the chat threads, I have not been given any concrete guidance on how to best configure their plugins with Cloudflare APN, for example. Nor is there any detailed enough documentation that can guide people on what to expect with certain features active when it comes to making sure the site is unaffected. In a recent issue, it took the better part of 2 weeks for me to resolve an issue that would have been resolved in one chat support session on Rocket or WP Engine.To be fair, both Rocket and WP Engine are premium services at a premium price point. So, for what you pay for Siteground, I feel it is worth the savings if you do some of your own homework to support your communication with the Siteground support team. To be clear, although all the support at Siteground is very nice, people and, for the most part, helpful to the extent that you would expect for a mid to high-tier service."

For this reason alone - it's worth paying a little more but saving time, stress and hassle.SG's Wordpress performance plugin is also great and included with all WP hosting."
