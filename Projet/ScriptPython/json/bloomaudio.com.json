They also forgot to include the usb cable. When requested the cable, they claimed that they send it the next day, however, I waited for 3 days and asked them and they said they never sent it. I asked for return naturally and Bloom Audio insists to charge me a 15% of restocking fee $270. You can see the problems yourself in the video I recorded on youtube by searching bloom audio idsd problem.They would not refund my full amount and claim it has no issue and could be the cable. Well, you can watch the video yourself. Fortunately with the help of Paypal, I was able to get my full refund. These guys, Andrew and the other person are so unprofessional that please think twice before you buy from them. They will charge you couple hundred dollars for return even if they product is open box and malfunctioned."

The cable itself seems to have a connection issue. The left/right side cuts out with some movement. Recently I just can't hear from one side. It was extremely disappointing.[Edit] lost among the countless emails, they did immediately reach out to offer a replacement so excellent response and service."

Buying the Sennheiser HD800S headphones, iFi ZEN Phono, & iFi ZEN CAN has made me fall back in love with vinyl.And now I can listen to my music & movies without my wife complaining about the volume.2 points:1) iFi really needs to include the Power X power supply with their amps. If it makes such a difference, just raise the price by $100 & give it to me. Don't make me buy what I should already have, & make trash that doesn't need to be.2) Bloom needs to recommend accessories like the Power X (until they're included), and the 4.4mm Male to Male Balanced cable to connect the 2 amps."

As it turned out, my second choice also was out of stock. It appears that stock levels for Eletech products may not have been updating properly. In any case, I was contacted by the owner or Bloom, with additional apologies for the error. He asked if I would be ok with a much nicer cable than I originally ordered, for the same price. I took him up on his offer and the cable was received very quickly. I didn't go fishing for any sort of discount or freebie, and wasn't really concerned about the two out of stock orders. That said, it speaks volumes that Bloom Audio knew that it was a bad look to have two out of stock mistakes in a row with one customer, and did what I probably would have done if it were my company. In the end, Bloom won me a customer. The next time I'm looking for hardware my first stop will be Bloom."
