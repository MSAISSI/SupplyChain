Is it not time for ICANN or whoever oversees this, i.e Congress, to finally put these wholly unfair practices to sleep? If we miss some emails because they went to junk, we then have zero option but to pay these exorbitant fees for 'restoration' that is surely as automated as anything else out there. No human effort. Just click and it's done.Am I on another planet, or are 10 X charges like this -- that is, charging someone ten times what we should normally pay to renew a domain -- unfair, probably collusion, likely considered unfair practice and, from what I can tell, a host of what would otherwise be considered non-competitive behaviour in any other line of business? Please, Congress, if you're listening, make it stop. Finally. And help get us REPAID"

I complained again via Live Chat and it went blank and then a 'your IP has been banned' message appeared, meanwhile they are holding my prepay amount. SCAM. BEWARE."

When the auction was over I funded the remaining due to my account to pay for the domain won. Thats when problems started. They took the payment, said in chat they have my money but havent credited my account yet. They want me to do a kyc verification. I have tried every way I can but it wont submit, it just greys out the button and does nothing. The period to pay for the domain I got ends in 5 hours and my money is still stuck with them. Chat just told me to send an email which their website says its 24/7 but no one is replying. Chat is now offline (they site says chat is also 24/7). Im at risk of losing my domain and being unable to bid on future auctions through them becasue their code has bugs even though they have my money."

But the agent said via the chat, for this case he is not competent, I should write an email (with a 24-h time respond guarantee) When I said, D and I certainly will have more questions, or addit. answers, than I should take enough time, but telephone contact for customers is not possible! Every step back and forth take another 24 hours? Very unsatisfactory, yes customers should pay, but please donot contact us, seem to be the new credo of D's. A worldwide operating internetservice company that does not want to be reachable? Company growing, profits rising skyhigh, combined with service decreasing  >>  a bad sign. Anyway, I'm now forced, with 25 domains at D., to reconsider my clientness at D's., dispite the transferfees for 25 domains will be costing. D.'s new policy makes me realize that the feeling of security and support are too important for me. Why waiting, when service will get worse rather than better? Not 100% professional ? >> look before you leap !"

          "Contenu": "Do not sign up unless you wish for your details to be  difficult to delete and only removed by the discretion of Dynadot, regardless of privacy laws.I wanted to first close my Dynadot account, they stated they could not delete my account as I \"had an active domain tied to it\", I didn't, it was a glitch on their website. I told them to look at the WHOIS information for the glitched domain, which clearly shows it's now connected/transferred to a different registar, they ignored my request and just sent the same macro response stating \"I have an active domain tied to it so it cannot be deleted\" over and over again. I decided to reach out to their live chat instead of email, and they realized the mistake and opened a ticket to their engineers on my behalf. Sucks that I had to go through live chat as the customer support through email was just simply ignoring my details.After getting my account closed, and moving on to getting it deleted - Dynadot does not respect or understand GDPR. They replied to my account deletion request saying \"GDPR applies to companies based in the UK. We are based in the United States. Our governing body is ICANN and we are compliant with their requirements. \"The GDPR's territorial scope extends beyond the geographical boundaries of the European Union (EU) or European Economic Area (EEA). Article 3 of the GDPR explicitly outlines that the regulation applies to businesses processing the personal data of individuals who are located within the EU or EEA, regardless of the business's physical location.And aside from that, it's just plainly inconsiderate for a company to not delete your account when requested, with all the data breaches and such going on."

If you're a less experienced user used to having a mailbox as part of your domain registration (I did for the last 10 years with several registrars), be aware this is something you have to pay extra for with Dynadot (which for me works out more expensive than previously when you add on email hosting package). After realising this I then reverted to trying their provided mailbox whilst I can set up web hosting (meanwhile my email is out of action)..2. The mailbox provided with their free website builder package   cannot be used with gmail. Customer support confirmed to use POP with gmail you have to buy the \u00a390!! annual subscription...absolute joke. Their email client is dreadful, very limited options for customisation e.g can't have an image or change fonts in email signature. And now have to reply to everything via that instead of conveniently on my gmail app. Soon as my web hosting is set up WITH ANOTHER PROVIDER I will be switching mail hosting asap.3. Help not available during several attempts to set up DNS settings and mailbox4. After initial Inbox set-up (which did not receive messages) it is finally working so I am left forwarding mails to gmail so I am alerted daily and then logging on to their (html only) client to reply. So long-winded and this whole process has been a DISASTER and huge waste of my time - will be going back to 1&1 for domain & email."

They display PPC ads by default. And those ads can be used by evil companies with trademark, and their evil UDRP partners to steal your domain. None of your domains are safe because all domains have parts which resemale trademarks. As long as there are PPC ads on landing pages, you are potentially donating your domains to your enemies, and you can get them back only by spending time and money to reverse evil UDRP's decision in court, and it may still fail.2. If evil UDRP wants your whois info they just surrenders it. And evil UDRP uses your whois info in inappropriate ways, such as mixing UDRP complaints to benefit complainants, even if complainants don't make claims based on domain owners' identity. So evil UDRP can use one of their unfair decisions to support another of their unfair decision despite GDRP. 3. Their marketplace is great but, they give no hints about seller's identity, and there is lots of rooms for manipulation. These may not be important for most people and most domains, but for some people they can be extremely important. If these are corrected I would give them 5.Dynadot is great for domain buyers, just buy the domain, but not park there, and start using it immediately."

I bought a domain from Dynadot and, whilst it all went through successfully and I received the domain instantly, my account was 'randomly selected' for a fraud check.So I was told to verify my phone number. Fine, that was a quick enough process. 1 hour later I receive an automated e-mail asking for me to verify my details were all correct and accurate, again as part of a fraud check. Then not long after I received yet another e-mail this time from an actual representative to my PayPal address (not the account's address), asking if I authorised the transaction. At this point I was a quite annoyed because I had already proven twice that the order was genuine, I didn't feel trusted and certainly didn't feel like they were believing I was a real customer to them - which is unfortunate, because whilst I completely understand fraud checks are a necessity in business, their procedure for checking is completely out of control and seems to be very illogical. It made me feel completely uncomfortable with the company - at least check the most common methods of fraud (use of a proxy, different country purchase to billing country, etc) before instantly suspecting of fraud.Frankly, they should have stopped at the phone verification. Or have just stuck with one verification method that was most convenient to them, rather than using more than one method. This was frustrating because they could not verify my PayPal e-mail with my actual account e-mail because the PayPal address wasn't an active address (it was essentially a 'no reply' account). I suggest that they improve their fraudulent transaction checking procedures, otherwise so far no other bad experiences."

          "Contenu": "\ud83c\udf10 Why Owning a p.lc Domain at Dynadot is a Must for all .io domain owners! \ud83d\ude80 The ruling by the International Court of Justice has cast doubt on the future of .io domains. The UK's obligation to end its administration of the Chagos Archipelago, coupled with the potential cessation of .io, emphasizes the need for a secure and stable alternative like p.lc. Don't miss out on the opportunity to fortify your cryptographic identity. The 'p' in p.lc not only stands for Privacy but also denotes the Privacy Layer Cryptography TLD.For those navigating the cryptographic landscape with a .io domain, securing a p.lc counterpart is not just an option; it's a strategic imperative. Here's why every .io owner should consider owning a p.lc domain:\ud83d\udca1 99.99% Availability: In the world of p.lc, opportunities abound. A staggering 99.99% of .io domains are available at p.lc, providing a golden chance to duplicate your unique cryptographic identity with ease.\ud83d\udca1 p.lc on Search EnginesExceptional Ranking: Witness the power of p.lc on search engines like Bing and Google. Search 'IT dot p.lc' on Bing, and observe how this domain achieves impressive rankings within just one month of indexing.\ud83d\udd12 Enhanced Privacy and Trust: While .io has been a go-to choice for tech startups, the legal uncertainties surrounding its future make having a backup plan crucial. Enter p.lc - a symbol of enhanced privacy and trust. \ud83c\udf1f Distinctive Online Presence: Your online presence is a reflection of your commitment to innovation. Having both .io and p.lc domains sets you apart, showcasing your dedication to cryptographic advancements and ensuring a distinctive digital footprint.\ud83d\ude80 Navigating the Future: In an industry where adaptability is key, owning a p.lc domain positions you strategically for the evolving digital landscape. As challenges arise for .io domains, having a presence in the stable and potentially more secure p.lc extension is a prudent move.\ud83c\udf10 Act Now: Secure your cryptographic legacy with a p.lc domain today. Embrace the domain that not only aligns with your commitment to privacy but also safeguards your digital presence in times of uncertainty.Act now and acquire your p.lc extension domain at www.dynadot if your current registrar does not offer it yet.\ud83d\ude80 Ignite Your Cryptographic Innovation with p.lc - The Privacy Layer Cryptography TLD! \ud83c\udf1fEmbark on a revolutionary journey with p.lc, where 'p' not only denotes Privacy but also represents the dawn of a new era in Cryptography. The p.lc, is more than just a domain extension; it will become the beacon illuminating the path for cryptographic enthusiasts.\ud83c\udf10 Why p.lc?Unlike traditional extensions, p.lc opens up a world of available domains at dynadot.com.

Dynadot has definitely the best client interface of all registrars.One registrar has a terrible payment system taking 1 week to get payment via PayPal being credited to my account.One exception there is one registrar which offers what Dynadot unfortunately does not offer, the possibility to create an email inbox on any domain that I am created instantly and be able to send and receive email within 5 minutes for 50 cents a month or 5$ a year. Unfortunately,  Dynadot does not offer this feature to make Dynadot a 5 stars client rating but a very decent 4 stars.One word, Dynadot should be more transparent with the owner of his domain and disclose to such owner the results day after day of any expired domain, that way the owner could decide to remove such domain from the auction process or not, this will enhance the relation clients with Dynadot."

Others have complained about the non-intuitive interface and I suggest it needs a little work.(2) Two-factor Authentication is a great security feature, but Dynadot automatically logs me out after too short a period (1 hour? Less?) which means I have to keep doing 2FA throughout the day if I'm using my Dynadot account and doing other things at the same time.  I understand that this is for security purposes, but for those using a private computer at home, being repeatedly logged out and required to go through 2FA is unnecessary and tedious (and costs Dynadot additional 2FA fees).  I suggest an \"Are you on a public computer?\" prompt or similar when logging in."

We were going to move to Google Domains, but now they are bought by Squarespace. I like that Dynadot is a privately held company, and they said they plan to keep it that way for a long time. Great customer service so far. Absolutely no problems and easy-to-manage domains."
