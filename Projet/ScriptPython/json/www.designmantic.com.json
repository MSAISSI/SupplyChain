          "Contenu": "I paid for a logo in 2016.In July 2023 I received an email saying that someone else is interested in my logo. If I want to stop the other company using my logo, i have to give them $599.Initially it felt like a scam, but I honestly cannot remember what the website stated 7 years ago, so I do not know if I was made aware of this practice at the point of order. If you go on the website now, it's made clear that you don't own the website exclusively.I initially gave a 1 star review. But updated it to a 3 star review on reflection. However, the company is pressuring me to remove the review, so it's gone back to a 1 star review. I'd avoid this company."

They are claiming that another company is interested in buying the copyright/licensing rights to my logo. Further if I pay them a one time fee of $549 (by Monday) I can own the rights to the logo I had already trademarked and copyrighted through my patent attorney. Yes I already own the copyright and trademark so no you can\u2019t sell it or try to extort money from me. I promise my attorney will have a field day with this. Wrong is wrong and what you are doing to your customer base is just that wrong. I will never use your services ever again and I will make sure to spread the word to all my friends, family, and small business owners."

Now, we're receiving emails and text messages from them telling us that we need to purchase the copyright to this logo that we already purchased. I logged into our account to see what kind of license we have, but I can't find that information anywhere. What makes it feel scammy is the amount of people who have recently had the same experience as us. I've found many complaints from others who have also been contacted by designmantic asking for more money for an 'exclusive license'. This was never mentioned at the time of purchase. Why would I buy a logo that I don't fully own? This practice leaves a bad taste in my mouth and I'll be sure to avoid designmantic for future design needs."

Today, we got an email telling us that we need to buy our logo at a \"discounted\" rate of $549, or stop using it.  When buying a logo, we purchase the license to use the logo.  Our license to use the logo cannot be revoked!  Considering the hard handed tactics used by them, am guessing these guys are in financial trouble.  I'm sorry, but I'd stay away...To respond to the feedback from DesignMantic... in one of their email responses they told me \"If we will sell the rights of this symbol to our new customer so you need to take down the logo from your website or other platforms.\"  This is simply not true as selling the copyright to someone else does not revoke my existing license to use.I am not removing this review."

In my case, they responded because my instructions were unclear and designer did followed my instructions. I have told them what my company represents and the services that we provide, I was looking for a designer to impress me with creativity and not requires me to input every details in my logo! I want suggestions for custom design! NOT TEMPLATES! If you don't like the design, you don't get money back. So custom design is a scam, AVOID AT ALL COST!"

They held my website hostage trying to get me to pay $27/mo for the website instead of the $9.99 amount I signed up for. They would not fix my MX record to point back to my domain host so that my email would work. No website, no email, lost customers for days and days! And they humiliated me by publishing a page on my domain that says non-payment so my customers thought my website wasn't working because I didn't pay. Just completely unacceptable.

They are using client data  to manipulate and get clients to pay out. Is that even legal? Shame on you!

Do you even recognize the situation that small business owners have faced during the pandemic? Most have gone bankrupt and you are now trying to extort more money from these folks that have lost everything. Shame on you! According to 99designs a company that charges for and produces design services to a paying entity with the intent to knowingly do harm and defraud customers should no longer be in business. According to \u201cDesignMantic\u201d they provide and own design templates featured in their tools. A user can pick a template, customize and download it for use branding and printing purposes. However, the basic copyright of the design template (like symbols and graphic elements) remains with DesignMantic. That means customers are paying a very high price for an undercut and underrated service DesignMantic has no intention of letting the customer use as they maintain rights. Hmmmm. How exactly does that work when you have multiple conpetitors such as 99designs that aren\u2019t using the same underhanded tactics. Again shame on you. Either adopt fair and ethical business practices or go out of business."

Why are they advertising MY design as something for sale?! DO NOT DESIGN WITH THEMEdited to add: The same customer service rep who initially told me he had a client wanting to purchase my logo reached out and told me they were giving me rights to my logo free of charge asking me to delete my negative review. I informed him that I would edit my review, but I think it\u2019s a poor way to conduct business threatening to sell my logo to someone else unless I pay for the exclusive rights to it.

          "Contenu": "UPDATE 12/12/2019: I first called DesignMantic and asked to speak to the Head of Customer Support who had previously communicated with me. I was informed he was \"in a meeting\" and my number was taken. Not trusting that scenario (given the history) I also sent an email, which was returned as undeliverable. Apparently the individual no longer works at DesignMantic...why didn't they tell me that? \"Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.\"Therefore, I called back and spoke to whoever answered the phone. They agreed to refund the $21 that had just been charged and to cancel my account. I had, of course, asked to be canceled previously, so we will see if that actually occurs. The problem, of course, is that they still retain the ability to charge my credit card, and there is no functionality provided to remove one's financial information from their system. I shall be obliged to change my credit card number in order to actually know for certain that DesignMantic can no longer fraudulently charge me.UPDATE - 12/11/2019: Just noticed that after all that run around and final agreement from DesignMantic, I have been CHARGED YET AGAIN!!!  Unbelievable.UPDATE - 9/19/2019: DesignMantic's Head of Customer Support and Sales finally agreed to refund the $21. Three separate individuals, including the Head of Customer Support claimed they \"could not\" do this. For example: \"But I regret to inform you that as per our terms and conditions refund cannot be processed.\"My conclusion? In the process of my research I noticed that there are examples of similar experiences with this company, and almost verbatim communication. I believe DesignMantic Customer Service is following a script designed to convince the unhappy customer to give up, and if you don't they will eventually concede to what should be an immediate option: never charge a customer for something they don't want. Their pattern? First, show \"screen shots\" that supposedly evidence the customer signed up for a service. Second, offer to do additional work (which further embeds the customer in their labyrinth of options) at no additional cost. Three, finally agree to refund the money...if the customer is making a big enough stink about it.ABSTRACT:- I was billed for a service I did not want or need.- That service was deceptively portrayed during the check-out process.- Upon contacting their Customer Service, I was mistreated by two successive reps.- I reported the company to the FTC, and informed them of the Report #- I registered a complaint with the local Better Business Bureau, and informed the company- I gave this review, and informed the company- I was contacted by their Head of Customer Support and Sales, who again refused to refund my money, and suggested that I was completely incompetent throughout the process of purchasing.- I replied to his email.- I received a response acknowledging that they can make an exception to their policy and will be refunding my money, and asking that I remove my complaint and negative review.- I am leaving the record of this experience here, as I don't believe any customer should have to endure what I did in order to get the company to simply do the right thing.ORIGINAL STORY:I used DesignMantic to create and download a logo for $29 in August of 2019. I did not check a box for any unlimited additional edits, or any kind of ongoing service.When I was surprised by a $21 charge to my account in September, I called DesignMantic after having reviewed my account online to ensure that there is no evidence of any service being subscribed to, and nothing is available to cancel.I was informed that I had subscribed to their ongoing editing service (which I did not do, and which was not in anyway evident nor apparent during check out), and that while they would be glad to cancel my subscription, they could not refund my money.I pointed out that not only was I unknowingly subscribed, but that they can see that I have never utilized any additional editing options. Furthermore, even now knowing what I am looking for, I have been all over designmantic.com's website, and there is no indication that I have any subscription. The only suggestion that there is such a thing is that their Terms and Conditions, continually references a \"Service.\" The only reference to that in My Account, is labeled a \"FREE EDIT.\"There is no mention of any ongoing service in my account, no subscription, no option to cancel anything. This was an entirely phantom \"service.\" Nowhere is there any evidence of what one is purchasing, thinking that one is making a one-time, single purchase of a downloadable logo. This is a fraudulent approach to business, intentionally designed to harvest ongoing payments from individuals unaware that they have been roped into an unnecessary service.The two customer service reps I spoke with continued to repeat themselves, were using a phone line that was critically compromised by terrible break-up, refused to let me speak to anyone else, and placed me on hold for 3 minutes almost immediately after taking my call.This is a predatory business and I strongly recommend that no one do business with DesignMantic, as they are not honestly representing what is being purchased, and they are not interested in satisfying the customer.Update: 9-19-19The Head of Customer Support and Sales contacted me via email, and began in a polite manner.\"...I am Head of Customer Support and Sales at DesignMantic.com. Please accept my sincere apologies for any inconvenience caused. I completely understand your concern and once again sorry for the bad experience you had with the customer service representatives. Rest assured it will not happen again.\"Unfortunately, he did not continue in that vein, and his claim of sincerely apologizing and completely understanding is belied by what follows:\"However, I would like to clarify the following points before I can address your concern.\"  He then proceeds to describe the supposed process I went through in selecting what I purchased. His description does not even remotely resemble my memory of the purchase/check out process, and does not align with my goals in visiting their site to begin with.More importantly, however, this is all beside the point. The facts are these:- I did not knowingly purchase what I was billed for- Without ever having used ANY of their service, I requested cancellation and a refund.- They can validate that I did not utilize their service.The Head of Customer Support then insultingly offered me, not a refund, but an additional design service at no additional cost.\"Since we always value our clients and you are one of them therefore, I can offer you free design to compensate this amount. But I regret to inform you that as per our terms and conditions refund cannot be processed.\"This is entirely bogus. First, I have no need for another design, and if I did need one, I most certainly would not obtain it from this rude, shady company. Second, to claim that they cannot process a refund because of their Terms and Conditions is worthy of derision. It may not be their policy to do so, but they created their policy and they can amend it. Furthermore, no company or individual worth their salt would refuse to consider an exception to their rule on the basis of a valid concern, as I have expressed."

They kept send me the the wrong thing, or the wrong resolution, or without transparency, a total disaster and a waste of 4 hours. I never thought this process can be so difficult. On top of everything else, they were very VERY rude on the phone, all the time, no experience with customer service whatsoever. I wanted my money back, since there was so much trouble, but they said, that  this will not happen because they don't do that. I don't know in what country they are from, sounded like India, but they are totally unreliable, respectfulness, and unprofessional. I will never ever use them again, or ever recommend them to anyone. I hope this review posts, so it can save others the headache they did to me, and hopefully maybe even work on their end and learn to treat their customers with more respect.\r Update after DesignMantic response.\r I have never received any calls nor messages from you, ever. Please don't lie, it's not professional. Yes they have tried to resend me the files with other changes, but after 9 or more tries, IT IS STILL WRONG!!! I give up, I have used another company. Please stop trying, I don't have time to respond to all the tries, which are still not right. I appreciate the fact that they try, but someone obviously does not listen or understand my request. It's a white logo, with the letters being two colors, one red and one blue. Anyway, I hope they pay attention from now on, and good luck! And don't ask anyone to remove their review, that does not make you a responsible company.\r Another update...\rI have received a phone call and a message today. I did receive my files, and they have cooperated fully until I got what I paid for. \rThank you for your full cooperation."

I opened 3 tickets with issues I needed help , 5 days later they answer me , only one of the requests and just saying it works when they try ....I'm trying to cancel my subscription there , I sent them an email today, let's see when they will answer .Update: they answered the email next morning, way quicker than i thought.They said it was a misunderstood in my tickets and asked me if I feel like my issue was solved to update the review.I still think it's a awesome site for creating designs, but it has a long way to improve for website hosting."

          "Contenu": "I required a custom logo, as the stock logos on the site did not have what I was looking for, and was a little wary as I paid up front before receiving any graphics...  The logo designer, Asif P Lawrence, worked with me until I had the exact logo I wanted for our company, which was an amalgam of 3 logos they currently had on their site and a graphic which I sketched on a piece of note paper and took a photo with my phone and sent in.\rThey were professional, replied quickly each time I had something to add or note, and kept altering the logo until it was the way I specified even though it took a bit more than the 3 edits we had agreed.  I was probably really demanding and annoying, but they met all my needs and even reached out to call our office (in Canada) when clarification was needed.\rI'm not sure of all the negative reviews, as my experience with DesignMantic was optimal and I would use them again in the future for custom logo services.\r5 stars for servce but minus one star because I'm now unsure whether our company actually 100% OWNS the logo I designed and had commissioned... :/"

Found them to be extremely responsive, they produced all design proofs within the stated time frame (which was a much shorter time frame than I had expected).  They were extremely responsive to feedback and edits on my designs.  At the end of the easier-than-expected process they delivered high quality images that were EXACTLY what I had envisioned.  They delivered on everything they promised and exceeded my expectations."
