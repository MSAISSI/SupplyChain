Following this they offered me a discount if I rejoined, which turned out to be the opportunity to rejoin at the full price, which I found baffling and, of course, refused.This company continues to debit my card for monthly payments, despite me not having a membership and they ignore all of my support requests regarding this.I was an IT professional for many years so can confirm that it was not an error by myself regarding these products.Avoid this company, they are just trying to get you to sign up so that thry can generate a passive income for themselves without actually providing any value.Please also be advised that all reviews left on their website are first reviewed by the company, this means that they can remove any negative reviews and always has positive reviews."
