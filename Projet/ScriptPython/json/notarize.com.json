There were multiple steps to verify my identity, including questions and pictures of documents (without an option to upload files I had). I eventually made it through to a person, who was very unfriendly, made me take pictures again, and finally informed me that the IDs did not match, and canceled the session. He suggested to try again - which would have required going through the entire process again. What a complete waste of time!"

He ended the call by simply hanging up on me. Literally, he just hung up after notarizing my document. It was a terrible experience. I would never recommend getting notorized online. A complete lack of professional. I literally want my money back."

This was my first time using the service, document had lines missing the person on the video call never advised to fill them prior to notarizing.  So the document is useless to me now.  Asked to do it over or refund , and was refused.   Usually when you see notary in person they advise you, where to initial ,  and sign.  These guys don\u2019t care just quickly stamp and move on.  Hard refusal to redo or refund was upsetting.  Will never use again."

Overall, I understand there can be technology glitches, however, a human should be able to intervene and fix the problem especially with something as financially important as a mortgage closing."

I cannot keep delaying this, as I already have my mail starting to forward to this new address tomorrow. This experience has been incredibly slow and awful thus far. Can someone please help me notarize this document? I used Postscan Mail on 3 separate occasions in the past for several businesses of mine, and the notarize process was always instant.

In particular, the ID check took me over an hour! On the web site, the first page of my passport seemed to load with no issue (the website used my camera to take the picture). However, before I could get a picture of the requested signature page, a pop-up obscured the page and there was no way to continue (except to click \"my camera is not working\" which was not the problem). This happened on multiple attempts using two different up-to-date browsers (Chrome and Edge). I then tried an iPhone 7 which hung trying to get the second picture. I had to boot it and restart Safari with no open tabs to finally get it to work."

BUT if I knew it would take sooooo much longer to sign my sellers docs with this method I definitely would not have done it.  It took me 4 times longer to use this product!   Typing in ALL the info on the form\u2026 I didn\u2019t expect.  When I reviewed the docs ahead of time I Assumed they would be filled in when I signed\u2026. As that was the norm the 8or 9 times I\u2019ve bought and sold houses. Then I was a POA on this property, so I had to also type in two additional names and conditions (as attorney in fact).  Really?! How about a macro to fill that in? Or have it preprinted?  For Michigan the number of documents I had to sign were fewer than I\u2019ve done for other states but again, it took me longer than ANY other signing I\u2019ve done (in California, Washington and Michigan) I thought \u201cnotarized\u201d would be efficient, but it was NOT. It took almost 4 hours from the review the doc to signing off of the call.  Had I known I would have had someone come to my home again from a local branch of the title company with preprinted forms and signed them in half or a third of the time \u201cnotarized\u201d took. To the company: I recommend 1) sending the docs early ie day before\u2026and advising people to read over and letting them know they\u2019ll be filling them out.  (Fortunately I had most of the info on hand \u2026 but not all of it!). 15 min I was advised in email to review docs before getting on line is not enough time to review them.2) establish macros or click boxes for proxies or POAs.. way too time consuming to type in their names etc. 3) explain the process NOT just how to get on line, so people have the data in front of them (If it\u2019s truly a necessity to type in the data with online notary).I think you have many elements of a good product but until you further develop it and reduce the interface time I will not use it again. Thank you for asking! I wish you good luck to further develop it. \ud83d\ude0a"

My wife and I were both attending the online notarization, and we both timed out, since we started ahead of time (we were on separate laptops). This is understandable. But then we both had to re-enter our information, picture ids, retake the speed test, etc.The instructions said we'd have a chance to review docs before meeting the notary, but neither of us had an opportunity. Maybe we both missed it.We both got multiple emails with links to start the process, which is fine, but the one titled \"Verify your email address\" had a link that was confusing - it took us to our account, which was not useful for what we were currently doing, but later.I contacted support about the missing chance to review documents, and they were helpful.Also, the notary was very helpful, and gave us plenty of time as we went through the document. She dealt well with a little lag that happened during the signing process."

One of your notaries shut down the app so I had to start all over again, took me over an hor to finally get the notary done. Did not speak with her, I saw an empty seat when the camera came on, and then she just shut it all down, turned it off.

I think that's probably on me, but some reminder may have been useful."

At $25, the cost is pretty steep (vs.we paid $5 at a local notary for the same service a few days earlier - then needed this one more sheet done), and we didn't see any info on their fees ahead of making the connection with the notary official. So, there is a premium for the convenience."
