I received tracking on Tuesday and I didn\u2019t get my product until Thursday. Luckily the client was OK that we push the project off until Friday .----response to reply. We had a 5 Hour drive to customer so getting it Thursdays would not have been onsite on time from the time it was delivered. When placed i called to correct address and asked if it would get to me by then and was assured. I did not mind paying extra to get to me when i needed it, but no reason to pay extra to get to me earlier earlier and pass that charge to client when when everyone gets paid and would have been here on time as told over phone. It's ok things happen just wish would have been accurate information."

To be fair, they did ship the correct items without too much hassle once I contacted them regarding the error.  Therefore, I am raising my review from one star to three due to the follow-up effort."

I got shielded riser rated cable and bought ends that I thought would fit based on the description. The bag of connectors was $56. They don\u2019t fit the cable at all because of the shielding. Now I\u2019m stuck with them. I bought boots for ca6 as well that looked to be right. They don\u2019t fit shielded cable at all. Wasted money. The plugs that do fit shielded riser rated cat6 are over $100 for a 50pk. In cannot find anything this expensive anywhere online as I\u2019ve searched lanshack and elsewhere trying to figure out why the plugs are so expensive. Frustrating. It would be helpful if the site helped check compatibility of items as you added them to your cart. I wasted over $70 on items I purchased and I am frustrated by this because I believe I looked carefully in selecting the cables and items that I did for my installation."

I found a piece of tape stuck to the reel to which fiber scraps were also adhered.  Those should have been more carefully kept track of and disposed of in the shop.

          "Contenu": "I will happily edit this review if the situation clarifies, but so far it's been a disappointing experience.  On 12/31/21 I ordered a pair of 7ft CAT 8 and a single 10ft CAT 8 ethernet cable, all three in black.  I received a package from LANshack on 1/10/22 which contained 5 10ft CAT 6 cables in white.  I called the customer service department to inform them of the mix-up.  The service representative requested I email them some pictures to document what I received, which I did.  I did not receive any communication from LANshack after sending them the requested email.  On 1/12/22 I called customer service again hoping for an update of some sort.  I spoke with a different service representative, but I provided the name of the party I spoke with originally.  I was told by the second service representative that she would follow up on getting my order fulfilled correctly.  As of 1/14/22 I have not been updated regarding a resolution, and I'm ready to write the situation off.  The items I actually ordered may or may not arrive.  At this point I don't care.  I'm aware things can take time to get corrected, but the total lack of effort to keep the customer informed of any progress is a sticking point for me.  I'll shop elsewhere next time.Update:Within 30 minutes of my admittedly rather negative initial review going live I was contacted by a third representative, and he seemed quite eager and capable of rectifying the situation. I trust that individual will also read the edits I'm making here, and I wish to express my gratitude for his involvement.  I can't justify a 5-star review in this instance given totality of my experience, but I will certainly amend my previous statement regarding purchasing elsewhere in the future.  When problems arise, rest assured there's at least one person at LANshack that cares deeply about getting them resolved."
