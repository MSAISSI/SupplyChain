They tell you that the part will fit your appliance and then blame you if it doesn't and will not take a return or give you your money back."

They say I just don\u2019t want the part anymore. What I want is something compatible with my washer that will fix my washer. Since they won\u2019t classify it was a \u201cwrong part\u201d they want me to pay a bunch of money to ship it, pay for shipping insurance (because they make it clear that if it\u2019s damaged in transit I\u2019ll lose all my money), and pay for tracking. So not only did I pay over $90 for a part that will never work, but I\u2019m out money because I have to ship it back. I bet this company is good when the part they send you works, but if it doesn\u2019t they will screw you over."

At least my money was promptly returned but now I can never trust that they can deliver any part so why bother using them. Find another vendor who will at least be honest with you about their inventory and availablility."

It has been over a week now of customer service waiting for the warehouse to respond about the pictures I sent?

This is a shipping error not a product malfunction as it has not been installed yet?? Seems deceitful and dishonest that they need info that doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the issue.

On 7/20 I had not received a shipping confirm and checked the status of my order, which showed Processing.  I called Customer Service and was told that the order had not been assigned because my Ship To and Billing Address were different.  Someone could have called to let me know this would hold up the order.  I instead verified the information and was told since I called and did so, they would now assign my order, but I would not have it until Tuesday.  I believe this was a gap in their customer service and they should have overnighted the part to me, when I made this request I was told they only do ground shipping.  Should I receive this order quickly, I will update this review, but as of now I am not a satisfied customer."

Really???I had to call LG customer support, who actually supported me as their job title suggests, for the numbers (but they were too expensive).I only bought the parts from you as another site I tried didn\u2019t pass muster with my bank so I went back with proper numbers and bought the parts, that your company couldn\u2019t provide, so that I could do the repair and move on.You have parts but who the hell knows what they fit?

When I reached out to the company they said their shipping times aren't guarenteed.   If I had known their delivery date wasn't reliable, I would have ordered from one of the many other companies who offered the product for much less.  Perhaps this is an uncommon problem...idk?  I hope so, but posting in case other customers are also paying more for a product because they are under the assumption it will arrive faster when it doesn't.  Note: I did edit the above as it orginally said I spent more for expedited shipping.  This was my mistake and not a separate charge.  I paid more because I assumed the higher price took that into account and that's why I was getting the product faster than all the other sites showed... and that's why I paid double the price."

The part that shipped was not the correct part (it was in a bag with the correct part number; but the wrong part inside). The part did not include an opening for the sump sensor. GRP Customer Service wanted pictures, which I sent. I also sent a second round of pictures showing the part that needed replaced and the part they sent, showing the difference in the two parts. They replied that the part they sent was correct for the model I had, and that I should install it. Doing so would mean leaving the sensor hanging outside of the sump. Bad advise since this would cause the wash cycle to fail. I knew enough to ignore this advise and ordered the part from my regular vendor, (exact the same part number that I originally ordered from GRP) and got the part I needed. This was my first order with GRP. Still waiting to see if I will be refunded my $$$. Or if they will want to charge restock/ return postage. I\u2019m chalking this up as a lesson learned. I\u2019ll stick with my current vendor even though they are a few bucks more, I never had an issue getting or returning products.Oh, delivery was quick. The only plus so far, so they got a 2."

          "Titre": "Exploitative return practices",
          "Contenu": "As many others here have stated, you should absolutely not order from this company if there's any likelihood that you will need to return the item. If you are certain that you need the part and won't return it, then it will arrive quickly and reasonably priced. They can justify this business model because of their stingy return model. Here's my experience: I ordered a heating element for a dishwasher and then before opening the package realized that something else was causing the problem. So, I didn't even open the shipping box the part arrived in. My original order total was $56.41 and I believe I paid about $9 to have it shipped here with the part costing around $47. Returning the heating element UPS Ground (the method they used to send it to me) cost me $27.89. So, even if they credit me the original purchase price back which is NOT guaranteed in their policy, returning the part will net me $19.11 for a $47 part that I never even removed from the box.It is deeply frustrating to me that it has cost me 3 times the original shipping amount to ship this back. I think it is reasonable for me to pay for the return shipping as long as the cost doesn\u2019t exceed what I initially paid to ship the item. Having a consumer shoulder the cost of shipping is exploitative since shipping companies charge individual consumers much higher than businesses. If GRP provided a return shipping label and then deducted the shipping cost from my return that would make a lot more sense. As it stands, this transfers all of the risk to the consumer.I reached out to the company to give them a chance to respond before posting this review and I was told that shipping was my problem and their shipping rates were low as a \"courtesy\" to the customer. It's obvious that this is an intentional business model, not a courtesy--and one that is incredibly profitable for them. This return policy is the reason that they can charge what they do for parts and get them to you so quickly. But they've just lost my business. I would encourage you to carefully consider the many similar experiences to mine before purchasing from them.UPDATE (11/18/22): I just received my refund. After \"restocking fee,\" my actual net is $16, which doesn't even cover my time invested in the extensive return process. This is an unacceptable way to do business and I think consumers should be aware before purchasing from Genuine Replacement Parts."

But they won't cancel the order until Saturday after they've confirmed the order has not shipped. So there's no evidence it has shipped but they need two days to confirm it has not shipped. **** Update: they went ahead and cancelled the order the same day of the request.

          "Contenu": "I sent back 2 parts (completely unopened).  I had to call customer support after 17 business days to start the refund process which will take another 3-5 business days (which is now processing). I sympathize with GRP on returns of opened parts and the process to issue the refund but when unopened parts are sent back waiting 15 business days (and I had to call to move it along) + 3-5 business days for refund is unacceptable.  I have a feeling they wait for a call to continue the process possibly hoping some customers will forget.Another issue cropped up.  I notice the refund amount pending for these 2 items are less that what I paid for them + tax.  Immediately I assumed restocking fee, so I perused the webpage to find that policy.  The link I was using (Customer support -> FAQ -> return policy) to the return policy does not mention a restocking fee of any kind and I showed customer support and she agreed with me.  The other link (bottom of home page -> near right of screen -> return policy) shows a completely different policy (which includes mention of restocking fee).Update:  I appreciate the fact you understand my confusion on the restocking fee regarding the old link.  I hope you can understand my frustration of the return process when returning unopened items, it should be much faster.  I do appreciate you actually respond to customer issues as well."

Angie was very polite. Offering to replace the part with the correct one or take a full refund on a $150 part with no questions asked. I emailed Angie more detailed pictures of my fridge info (model/serial number, part number picture of my circuit board) as well as pictures of the part I received. Angie promptly passed the info to GRP\u2019s technicians. With in a few hours she emailed me back with answers to my questions including a written instruction sheet with pictures and a video on how to install the circuit board I received. I had received the correct one it just needed to be broken in half on the seam of the two circuit board.  Their circuit board fit perfectly, fixed my refrigerator, was extremely easy to install and program with the instructions provided by Angie. I would highly recommend GRP. Their customer service is superb and their parts are high quality. Not to to mention how amazing Angie was to answer all my questions promptly, professionally and with such politeness I never once felt I would be stuck with a $150 part because of ordering error on my part. Thank you GRP and huge thank you to Angie for helping me along the way.Eric"
