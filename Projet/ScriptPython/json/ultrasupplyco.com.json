          "Titre": "Quality Product, that Could be Improved",
          "Contenu": "The Ultra Supply Co \"Watch Band Organizer Case for Apple Watch Ultra Travel Pouch\" is a well made product and I'm pleased with both the design concept and color. It appears to do a good job of holding up to five (5) watch bands in a single pouch so I don't have them floating free in my sock drawer, my watch storage case, or on top of my dresser. However, the length of the watch bands that the case will accept is somewhat limited. For example, an Apple Braided Solo Loop Watch band (or similar solid straight length design) that requires a Size 10 or 11 length band will fit; but a Size 12 will not. If the case were 1/4-inch longer, that problem would not exist. Also, the case is designed to be folded 3 or 4 times so it stays compact. I like that concept, but they did not allow for fold \"zones\" between the individual watch band slots. Therefore a portion of 2 or more watch band slots has to be devoted to a fold zone. I currently have 3 bands stored with empty slots between, so I currently have no problem with fold zones. But adding a 4th and/or 5th watch band will make the folding a more challenging situation. That said, I still like the product and will use it until I find something that better fits my needs."

          "Contenu": "Not only does the band match my Ultra 2 perfectly, it compliments it as well. I'm a \"real\" watch guy dipping his toe in, and I rarely wear a bracelet, but the Ultra Supply co. Ti band is an ideal match. I can wear it in the pool as well as at work. The inverted end-links make the bracelet drape well and the links have a great amount of articulation without being sloppy or jangly.If I were to identify areas for improvement, the clasp needs work. Two holes of microadjust simply aren't enough. I also understand why the links are pin-and-collar instead of screws. I am a pocket knife guy as well and I've seen stripped-out Ti scales from screws far harder than Ti being used. It's still pin-and-collar, though; there MUST be a better way. These two deficits are why I'm at 4 stars. Fix those, and this easily becomes a 5-star band."

          "Contenu": "I wanted to have a titanium band for my Apple Watch Ultra 2 for more formal occasions. I first tried the more well-known ones (Nomad) that were highly recommended by review websites. Those cost around $299. Turns out that the QA was extremely poor and I couldn't even fit one side of the band into the watch. I then tried the Apple Link Bracelet. That was far more expensive and it is by far the easiest to resize. But it was also extremely uncomfortable for me as my hairs keep getting caught between the links.I decided to take a chance on Ultra Supply, despite it not being as well known as others. For $120, I have to say it is extremely worth it. The finish is impeccable and I can't tell any difference between the titanium on the band and the one on the Apple Watch. It also comes with a DLC coating. Not sure about longevity given that all metal bands are known to scratch easily. The magnetic clasp is also extremely easy to put on or off. The only minor complaint is that resizing is more painful than the Apple Link bracelet, but this is mostly a one-time affair. I doubt you want to be resizing all the time even with the Apple bracelet. In summary, great value for quality at $120. I did not bother to try the $30 China ones on Amazon. I personally have trouble believing any good titanium band can be obtained for $30 and the reviews on those are mostly bot generated (use fakespot to check)."
