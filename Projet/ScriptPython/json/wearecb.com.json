I was on a time crunch and had no other option. But I hate being lured in with low prices only to get robbed blind on the shipping. I see this as a shameful gimmick to increase sales and will spend my money elsewhere."

I was called a second time several days later (by the same rep) about my order. Their website had given me free shipping rather than charging me as intended. It was a site-wide bug not applying some minimum order price for shipping. She asked me if I\u2019d be generous enough to retroactively pay shipping on an item that was already heading my way. I chose not to, as I fail to see how their oversight is my problem. I wouldn\u2019t have bought their $10 wire if they wanted the $7 shipping in the first place. I\u2019ve never heard of an online seller making an error and having the gall to call the customer and quite literally beg for money."

          "Contenu": "I paid EXTRA for a CB to enhanced.  The radio does not work, at all.  I have went to (2) local CB shops thinking that I was an idiot.  I have a Workman SWR meter and the SWR is under 1.5 on Channel 40 and on Channel 1.  This is NOT rocket science and the (2) shops confirmed with HIGH END electronic SWR meters that my SWR is very low.  I had done a great job.I subsequently paid 50.00 to have the system gone through, and it was determined that it is the radio.  The radio sends ands receives UNDER 1/2 mile.  It is GARBAGE.  I never received a receipt and when I contacted Uniden, without a receipt they will not look at it under warranty.  Also, the amount freight was exuberant.  If you are going to sell products at low margins, do not kill the freight to make up for a poor business model.I said something about the freight and whomever at the CB shop fired back a rude and condescending response.  I ship products for a living.  The box I received was under 20# and the antenna was not in the Wilson packaging.  If the CB shop paid 80.00+ to ship that from Oregon to Arizona, then they are NOT very intelligent.  I ship speakers, all north of 40# in larger boxes.  For me to pay 80.00 as I was rudely informed by the CB shop, it would be OVER 100# and be going from AZ to the NE USA.  The only way to fix this is to send me a radio that works and that is what I paid EXTRA for, or to refund everything.  There is no discussion.Today is 10/21/2022 - in 1 week if I have not heard back I will protest the charges with the credit card company and get it back that way.***EDIT #1:  I have to edit my response because I cannot respond to that futile attempt of justification.  I was -1- count'em 1 day outside this \"30 day\" window.  You have been nothing but RUDE and condescending this entire time.  I have e-mailed you.  You now have 6 days to conform or I will win on the chargeback and that WILL cost you more money."

The antenna cost about $40 and with shipping I paid about $50 for this defective antenna.  With shipping to Hustler and back it would cost another $35-40 to get a working antenna.  I will just eat the $50 and never do business again with CB World or Hustler (New-Tronics).  I tried to buy this USA product but will go with Amazon in the future.  They stand by their products."

          "Contenu": "Purchased a ProComm RG8X coax with both 259 connectors attached.  Connected it up to my Cobra 29LX.  Worked well in testing (low SWR) After a day or two started getting some random antenna warnings.  It was off and on.  Thought the stud was the problem so I changed it out.  Worked for a bit then back to antenna warning.  Very frustrating.  Then heard a \"Pop\" on the radio and then I couldn't transmit.  After some investigation found out the 259 connection wasn't constructed correctly and if the coax moved a bit it would short out.  Finally got ahold of CB World and although they were apologetic, they haven't done anything about my damaged radio.Update:  Here is an idea. . .How about standing behind your products??? . . . For those of you that want to heed CB worlds advice just be advised that it may take days to hear back from them."

I contacted Hustles antenna to tell them of the problem and they told me I would have to buy the part,no problem... BUT the price of the 1 part was $20.00. Now the part is 1 of the smallest parts on the antenna, the only parts smaller is the set screw and the sleeve( the part is about 3/4\"x1/4\"). CB World knows of the problem and never got back to me in any way. It shows me they don't care about the customer at all. I will never buy from CB World again.After reading their reply I still stand by my reviews.  If the antenna had been stronger the base would have never broke."

          "Contenu": "Cobra 18WXSTII. I will try and be brief, but overall, I am very dissatisfied with CB World in general. I ordered the Cobra radio mostly because of it\u2019s reputation of being a well structured and reliable radio, but also because I like the scan feature advertised.My first order of the radio (77235) arrived and after installing it, I was not able to squelch out the noise using the squelch knob. After contacting CB WORLD Sales sales department, I was told that a return of the radio would be authorized. I asked if I could just get a replacement and was told no, that I would have to purchase a second radio and return the first one. Although I thought this was a strange way to conduct business, I agreed. When I was purchasing the second radio, I was asked if I wanted a technician to go through it to make sure everything worked. When I said yes, I was told there was a $25 fee to check the radio. Again, I thought this was strange, but needed the radio for an upcoming trip and made the order.I received an email with the return authorization information but found out that CB World does not provide a return shipping label and that the expense would lie with me. Frustrated, I mailed the defective radio to CB World on Friday 9-9-22. That was $15 out of pocket to return the defective radio.On 9-12-22 I received the second identical radio (order # 7732) and immediately installed it. While unpackaging the radio, I located a hand written note taped to the radio that read in part \u201c Talk with this Cobra Mic one inch or less from your lips. Set the dynamic control to 12 O\u2019clock. If you are too loud, turn it down a little\u2026\u2026.\u201dThe problem with that is, there is no dynamic mic control on this radio. As we started our trip, I connected with our traveling friends via CB and learned that I was over modulated and they could not understand what I was saying. Also, I was not able to squelch out All the noise, but only part of it making the trip extremely annoying and the CB pretty much useless. Along the way, I found a new Mic at a truck stop and switched it out with the Cobra Mic and found that I was now crystal clear.The first radio cost $84.90 and a return fee of $15.The second radio cost $109.99 and was still inoperable. My replacement Mic cost $21.99After contacting CB WORLD a second time regarding the microphone, I was basically blown off and offered no help.In my opinion, that is not the way to attract business or future customers."

Still Very Very unusual. So they agree it didn't take 3-5 business days. They also stated \"errors are very common\": then put that on there next to shipping description. Not their fault so they state, but it is misleading to customers."

Some wires were shorted and others were open.  I let CB WORLD know of the problem.  They told me the had never had a bad one and would not authorize a return.  Told me to keep the cord and they would refund the $5 for the cord.  If I had sold a bad cord, I would want to see it.  So I paid $7 for shipping and have to toss out the cord.  Actually, $7 is cheap for the education I received.  Nice doing business with ya CB WORLD.  It wont happen again!!"

I'll look at the website next time I need something, but I don't trust CB World very much now, so I'll be VERY CAREFUL when buying from them from now on. Amazon has this stuff too, and as much as I dislike enriching them, I'd rather do that than spend over $10 for envelope shipping."

I only live 10-15 minutes away. I would rather have just picked it up on the 14th but that wasn\u2019t an option, unless the website just isn\u2019t clear on how that can be done. Final result is $11+ to have my item shipped from Albany, to Portland and back again which is a bit steep for gross inefficiency.

The only reason why im writing this, because I was sent an email for a survey from WearCB today.  \r Update...\r Ken from CBWorld Contacted me and sent me another shipping label to return the speaker, and sent me a refund minus shipping.

But when using the Midland 75-822 in a car you use the adapter that allows you to power it from the cigarette lighter and the adapter also has a SO239 connecter for the antenna making the AR3 unnecessary.

I had saved the old microphone so I was able to use it to determine the correct pinout. Both the transmit and receive circuits were connected to the wrong pins. After re-wiring the connector, the microphone works very well with great sound quality and full modulation. Someone else probably would have just returned it and said that it was defective, but since I'm an electrical engineer I thought I could make it work. Considering the price paid, it was an excellent value and I'm happy with my purchase. Shipping charges were a bit high though."
