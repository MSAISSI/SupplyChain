          "Contenu": "I had my TMobile phone stolen in Chile last month. Filed an immediate claim with TMobile to have Assurant handle my claim for a replacement phone. Paid a $249 replacement fee on top of the $18 per month insurance for the last 3 years (another $648) to receive a replacement phone 2 generations back. UPS never delivered and the best they could promise was to open an investigation and contact me in 14 business days. Repeated calls to Assurant customer service only resulted in \"so sorry about your issue but we filed an investigation. Hard to understand the CS person. Had a strong accent and not sure they understood English. Promised to have a manager phone me within 24 hours. That was 2 weeks ago and have not heard from them. In the interim I had to purchase a temporary phone to receive calls. Did my own tracking with UPS and found they only had a shipping value of $111 for the Galaxy S21 Ultra but they still refuse to send me a replacement. What a waste of time and money"

          "Contenu": "In all honesty, my phone was weeks old when I first accidentally dropped it and cracked the screen. I also broke my wrist, requiring surgery. My first claim was denied. I was paying over $50 per month for a brand new phone with a cracked screen. Months later, my son dropped it according while Christmases shopping. The claim was approved. However, it's obvious that I received a refurbished phone in not great condition. Refurbished phones are not bad. I'm not against them. I believe a refurbished phone should be given to people that meet specific criteria. Example: After a year, the screen is cracked or there's water damage. After a year there is wear and tear of life that didn't happen in my case. Basically, insurance is NOT worth it. Especially with the parameter and rules currently in place."

Similar situation I had with Assurant, I had with ABICOF - Negative in most respects. A non-insurance agent sold me the policy and at the time I didn\u2019t realize it. Costs were way high so I attempted several times to stop the additional items I obviously didn\u2019t need, with no fanfare. And, moreover, I cancelled early and found the company slow and unwilling to refund my total amount due. I\u2019m still trying after several weeks to resolve the problem. No progress, therefore, i would never recommend them for insurance."

I'm now stuck with a damaged device that has been insured for over 2 years with a 360 plan. In fact I've been a Tmobile customer for over 16 years. It's useless to continue with a protection plan for a device that can't get replaced once it's damaged. I will be dropping the coverage. The parties I spoke with, all seemed very disinterested in finding a solution even the supervisor had little to no concern for a loyal, devoted, and tenured 16 year customer. I hope non of the of customer experience what I did."

IE diagnostics feesI purchased a car and extended warranty with the RAC so when my car had a catastrophic gearbox failure 5 months into ownership I had to call upon my warranty as the main dealer I purchased from didn't want to know. Bookimg in the repair was simple and it took me to a third party booking company, they recommended and approved repairer and I thought that would mean Id be in safer hands as I've had poor experiences in the past with mechanics as I've no clue about it. Well how wrong could I be, the garage who I have a separate issue with , diagnosed the fault and reported back to assurance that the gearbox had failed and would require a replacement. Assurant then requested it to be sent off for an independent inspection before they could process the claim. At no point during this process I was made aware that 1, the gearbox needed to be sent away and 2, I was liable for the \u00a3150 fee plus a recycling fee of said gear box. Anyway they approved the claim after me chasing a few times . Fast forward a week I get a call from the repairing garage to say my cars ready but the invoice needed to be settled and that was just over 3k . As I was told earlier on I wouldn't have to pay and reclaim I was confused why I was being asked to fork out this money and wait 21 days for it to be refunded . The repairing garage has now since held my car hostage as he's wanting old invoices from other clients paid up too before he will release my vehicle! Seems this company do not care who they send you to for repairs. Also seems they do not pay their repairing garages and quite frankly do not care about their customers who pay a premium the products. All in all I'm still 8 weeks later with no car and have had zero support from these guys as they don't care ."

My experience with their customer care regarding my faulty Car Window master switch has been incredibly disappointing. Initially, they insisted on upfront payment before reimbursement. When I explained that the issue existed when I purchased the car and neither I nor the dealer were aware of it, they began pressing for the cause, seemingly to avoid processing the claim promptly. Dealing with this warranty service has proven to be a regrettable decision.Update:Further Action has been taken by referring this issue to ADR Group as told by the Assurant Warranty Department.Such pathetic service... The response they provided states that I am not eligible to claim for the pre-existing issue in my car. This service is extremely disappointing. I am now planning to launch a comprehensive campaign against them to demonstrate the power of the customers. Stay tuned for further developments."

I contacted Assurant today as these parts must be under warranty, and they are for 6 months, that would be fine but knowing Assurant don\u2019t fit genuine parts I\u2019m not expecting the new parts they will need to replace to be genuine, but funnily enough the new parts they will replace will only be covered for from the original 6 months so if they fail again I left with broken parts at my own cost as they wont be under a new 6 month\u2019s warranty. This company is one of the biggest scammers and rip offs I\u2019ve ever come across. They take your money every month and if you ever make a clam you left with something that isn\u2019t what you thought you been paying for! Do not use this company to insure any gadget you have. You will regret it if you have to make a clamNone genuine parts that aren\u2019t even covered by warranty properly!"

The representative Sage (he advised he is the Only employee at that location) said \"sometimes that happens\". I did not accept that answer.He advised he could order another screen but it would take 2 weeks to arrive. He was then going to send me away with no documentation to prove the screen was damaged at the time of repair. I had to request a receipt, I then wrote on the receipt New Screen Damaged will return in 2 weeks for replacement, and I requested he sign it. However, when I left the location my phone service could not connect. I called CPR and Sage stated he did not know what could be wrong. I went to T-Mobile and they did everything they could to troubleshoot the issue.I was advised the only determination could be that the LTE antenna was Not reconnected during the screen repair.My phone then had to be fully replaced by T-Mobile under warranty. I called CPR back and was told \"Well, I'm glad YOU got it worked out\".This experience was completely unacceptable, and You should NOT be charged for the screen replacement as the Repair was NOT completed. Thank you!"

Everything on the phone was working just fine except for a minor crack on the screen that wasn't causing any issues. The only reason that we decided to get my wife's screen replaced was because I was already going to get my phone screen replaced which was much more damaged. When we went to pick up both phones, my wife's phone internet/data was no longer working. After questioning the technician, he tried to hide the fact that he had damaged the components/parts that allow the phone to use the internet/data. After speaking with the technician and Assurant CSR, we came to the conclusion that we had to replace the phone with a refurbished one. The technician gave us 100 USC in order to pay for the insurance deductible. I am disappointed that this is the only repair shop near me. When I had ATT, they would come to your home to do the work in the van or they had more repair shops to choose from."

I did not  agree with the findings and was asked for additional docs which. The adjuster Michael did not even add any of the additional docs. The revised settlement was nearly the same as the one prior nothing was looked at . I'm beginning to think maybe he's  a little bias. My issue is mainly with assurant why hire a company that's unfair to service your customers. They should be our advocate. The adjuster is rude, dismissive and the office staff is awful. Every single time I call, they constantly argue with me, total disregard and unprofessional. I'm not begging these people. I just want to be treated fairly. I want these people investigated/ audited. I know some things are not covered by flood insurance but the ones that are covered should be covered. Right is right I don't wish this on my worst enemy.

They stripped the engine (videoed and photographed the process) and sent the above off with a report to Assurant. They then asked  my garage for the turbo to be sent to them, so they did. I call a call from my garage to say Assurant won't cover the cost for a new engine because the was a build up of carbon in the turbo and the warranty didn't cover that! How was I to know? My car had full service history as I had looked after it well. I am still paying the finance for the car until next year and now cannot afford to buy another one yet. To say I am upset is an understatement. I also have to pay the garage for their labour in all this. Please be very careful with this company and make sure you understand what they cover as I don't want this to happen to someone else. I put a complaint in but got no where as they said its their final decision."

The only way to get value from this plan is by losing or breaking it more and even then- that's dealing with an insurance claim where you could just go and buy a new phone right away.

However, it was quick to blame me for the damage, did not make enquiries with the courier, or proffer any evidence that the phone was damaged by me or poorly packaged. To be able to have a phone, I had no option but to pay another claim fee of \u00a375. I will escalate my complaint to the Ombudsman."

          "Titre": "Very frustrating and disapointing",
          "Contenu": "This was a very frustrating experience.  After paying my monthly premiums on all of my family's 5 phones for several years, they failed to deliver when I actually needed it.  We filed a claim for my daughter's phone which she dropped and the back cracked.  We never heard back so tried to use the mytmoclaim.com website which give us an endless stream of error messages \"Try again.\"  When we called Assurant, they notified us that the claim had been denied because the phone was not covered at the time of the incident!  The phone had been covered at all times since it was purchased.  To sort this out, rather than Assurant contacting T-Mobile, I had to call T-Mobile and play middle man between the two organizations!  T-Mobile's insurance claim line had a 30-minute wait time.  Once I spoke to the T-Mobile rep (much more helpful and informative than the Assurant rep), we both had to wait on hold while he tried to track down someone at Assurant to help correct their incorrect information.  We're still on hold for that call, and if this lasts much longer I may need to downgrade my '2' to a '1'.  This is incredibly frustrating when you think of how much I have paid this company years.Update; the T-Mobile rep was able to determine that the phone number associated with the claim was for the \u201cparent\u201d phone rather than the child phone and that this was why the claim was denied.  It was confusing when we originally submitted the claim and I suppose my daughter entered my number when she should have entered my own.  At any rate, her i Duran r policy is valid so she can resubmit the claim."

They do not do anything to help. We filed a claim on 9/11/2022; they failed to scan in the phone at their center for over 4 months although it was received weeks after we sent it back. Then when they did, they claimed we sent an empty box and that we had to pay for the phone. Why the F! Would we send an empty box back to them and why did it take so long for them to scan the package in (someone took it out of the box). On top of all this, the phone they sent was refurbished so it lasted a whole 2 weeks before having issues. So of course we filed a new claim and someone how they got it taken care of really quickly (I wonder if it was because they knew it was refurbished unlike the first phone). I have now cancelled this insurance and my contract with T-mobile."

Neighborhood so I sat in my car while the repair was made in the parking lot behind. The person who did the repair was great and finished it sooner than he promised. Also this company has a policy of when you open a claim if it's closed you only have 90 days to reopen it whether or not there's a facility close enough to do the repair. I had to call the corporate office to get them to reopen the claim. The initial facility that they wanted to send me to would have required me taking an entire day off of work to get this repair made since they no longer have repair facilities at the Mobile store locations which is absolutely ridiculous this company claims to be transparent and have easy quick repair options and that is the opposite of the truth this company is nothing but a fraud and in addition to paying my deductible they put tax on top of the deductible which is not stated up front again fraud... There's already been one class action lawsuit against this company I see another one in the near future... Such a waste of money. Also the fact that I could have gotten a mobile protection straight through the manufacturer for far less than what I'm paying with T-Mobile is very frustrating. This is something that should have been offered when I got the phone but of course it wasn't they only Supply Asurion which is a joke..."

          "Contenu": "I originally gave a very positive review of four stars with my only complaint being that the location of the place was too far, but now I am changing it to two stars, and I am only giving that extra star because they did fix the cracked screen. Here is the problem. They put the wrong sim card in my phone, which means they put the wrong sim card in someone else's phone. This is serious, as both of us were receiving personal information that we should not be privy to. I immediately called T-Mobile Customer Care to let them know what was happening. T-Mobile is trying to fix it, but the problem is so bad, they had to kick it up to the engineers, and now my phone is not working at all. To say this is a serious inconvenience and an infringement on my life is an understatement.Update: My phone has finally been fixed. It took over a week to get the issue resolved, which I found out should not have taken that long, but the unsatisfactory service I received from two T-Mobile neighborhood stores made the issue worse. I did go back to the Assurant provider that fixed my cracked screen. They denied that they switched SIM cards and that it could have been an error made at T-Mobile's end, where one of their staff members could have punched in the wrong SIM card number. While that explanation is possible, it does sound suspicious that this happened around the same time my phone was getting fixed by them.Somehow my phone number got compromised when this SIM card swap happened, and it took over a week for the engineers at T-Mobile to fix it, but it would have not happened if I had not gone to the main store in Times Square, where the district managers are located. They are much more helpful and seem to have better access to the tech support team at T-Mobile. Whatever it is, this should have never happened, but T-Mobile did credit me for the time I went without cell service. I do want to give credit to the T-Mobile store in Astoria Queens, which is near the Assurant provider I went to. They advised me to go the T-Mobile store in Time Square, and that is what finally got my issue resolved."

Impossible to contact anyone on phone.UPDATE 11/3/22After my above post, an Assurant agent called me to gather more details and got in touch with the repair company. After a few days, the repair company personnel came and completed the work. The microwave is now working OK for the last 2 days. The Assurant agent was very helpful."

          "Contenu": "UPDATE: 5/30/2023We received a phone call from a manager on Friday 5/26/2023.  His message said we should have our claim resolved by the end of this week, that is 6/2/2023.  I hope it happens; our claim was filed around 4/12/2023Assurant renters\u2019 policyReplacement coverageALE coverageStarted out as a negative experience, got better, then downhill fast. After the epic storms in s.FL in April, we found ourselves with our second floor unlivable and most of our belongings were damaged - furniture, clothes, shoes.  Give the situation, our landlord hired a team of people to come in and cleanup - we went to an Airbnb.  My experience with Assurant is less that stellar, and this is a generous comment.  I am disappointed especially because I work for a company that also provides P&C but I was convince dAssurant was the best. I\u2019ll refer to the adjusters by number because there have been three. In short - #1 Awful, # 2 great but short lived, #3 terribly  rude, and dismissive, doesn\u2019t make good on his commitments, tried to bully me.  Keep in mind that we have damaged and moldiy furniture in our garage, because we were told that we need to be able to sent more picture if necessary.  I an starting to think iI should consider a public adjuster or file complaint with the state.  Feel free to read the details below - Adjuster #1 -a day or two after starting the claim, I received a phone call, the adjuster asked me a couple of questions, then proceeded to tell me that she was recommending that our claim be denied due to a case of \u201cseepage\u201d which was not even close to what happened.  She later called my landlord, asked him a few questions and told him the same. The next day, I called Assurant, sent an email to the claims email address.  Enter Adjuster #2 - Adjuster #2 was helpful, she spoke quickly, was assertive but we appreciated her efforts to resolve the situation.  She told us to mitigate the damage to our things, get our clothes laundered or dry-cleaned as appropriate and assured us that ALE expenses would be covered.  She asked for our ALE receipts, which we  promptly sent, she issued the payment by the next morning.  We had also sent her expenses for meals, and she explained that they would not be covered b/c we have access to a kitchen. Per my policy, her statement was accurate.  I didn\u2019t send meal receipts the next time. the second receipt we sent, she never received\u2026 do we resent it.  She made us two payments then we couldn\u2019t reach her again.  In the meantime, we uploaded any pictures we could, and a not so comprehensive list of damages.  We didn\u2019t have access to our things, they were piled up in each room by the workers during the repairs. Adjuster #3 - a very rude, and dismissive person. How asked me for my ALE expenses and assured me that a payment would be issued in a day or two.  I asked him about our personal property claim, he said it would take as long as \u201cit just does\u201d and that  I should call him if I didn\u2019t hear from him in 3 days. HE also proceeded to tell me that - without receipts we could not prove the cost of the item that was damaged.  I\u2019ll clarify - we have REPLACEMENT coverage. That means that, and I quote - The cover page of my policy says \u201c REPLACEMENT COST - Your stuff loses value over time.If you selected replacement cost, we'll pay to replace your  items at today's cost. Yes, that includesyour electronics and headphones.\u201d Our policy states \u201cInsured for Replacement Cost, we will pay theamount of loss, whether or not you repair orreplace the damaged property.\u201d  He told us that they would pay what they see fit and that there is no time limit on how quickly they reply in writing.  I asked if he read my policy and understood the time line for claim settlements.  He said he hadn\u2019t looked at my policy.  He also said that they had not received any of the evidence we emailed to the claims email, or uploaded to the claim portal.  YET he referred to items on my list. He asked me to send everything again.  (I saw my attachments in the client portal for a few days, then they disappeared. We spoke on 5/10, he told us the AE expenses would be paid out ASAP.  It\u2019s 5/24. Still no payment. His status of our claim\u2026 it is still under review.  We have waterlogged belongings at home growing mold, credit cards accruing interest from the second half of our ALE payments. And I have no faith that this rude dismissive adjusters cares whether our lives go back to normal. So disappointed."

I'd give them a 5* nodue to the handling of multiple issues by one of their Corporate Office team executives, Corrine Williams.  Corrine was outstanding.  How she stayed on top ofthis and worked to resolution and was as positive and and professional as anyone can be.  It gives an average score of a 3* which I feel represents the overall process.  But Corrine was the only reason this review has changed.  She made an impossible situation riddled with problems and mistakes come to a successful and positive resoltion.  Thank you Corrine!!!"

          "Contenu": "Edited to add - A very nice woman from the Texas Corporate office called me and apologized for my struggle with the company. She gave me her name and email to use if we had any further issues servicing our other appliances insured with Assurant. She also increased our food loss claim. For this, I am increasing the review to 3 stars. It's nice to speak with someone, even if they're at corporate, that speaks English and cares about customers. She never should have had to call and is taking steps to improve customer experience.__________________________________________________They get one star for actually paying out, after my attorney was involved. I purchased a five yr extended warranty on my Samsung refrigerator through Lowe's. Assurant is the policy holder. In NW Florida, they use one service company THREE hours away and they didn't show up half of the time. To make matters worse, the CS reps @ Assurant are rude, don't bother actually looking up your information, or trying to solve issues. They only tell you your claim has been escalated, when it has not. I went without a fridge for 8 weeks and they didn't care. I submitted a food loss claim (bottom freezer) along with a replacement request since they can't get anyone to fix my fridge. It took 7 weeks to resolve this issue. I will NEVER again purchase a policy through Lowe's, with Assurant, or a Samsung fridge."

She immediately went to the back room retrieve my phone and says \"our tech cracked the back glass while repairing the front.\" Following this statement she says they ordered a replacement and will notify me when it's there so they can replace that as well. I'm a bit disappointed and am hesitant to go back, for all I know I may be going a 3rd time after they crack the front glass while repairing the back. Have not heard back regarding back glass replacement or repair. Update: I've been contacted to return for a repair of the back glass."

She was very pleasant and extremely helpful and resolved the situation within a few minutes. She wanted to know what issues I was having and issued funds for replacement. Done and done the right way! Thank you Stacey!\u25cf Company claims to \"REPAIR or REPLACE\" in a timely manner.... well 2 months in to a claim and nothing... still waiting to hear back from Assurant or even the tech they say is coming to look at my microwave. I would love to get a representative from one of the two places.  Every time I try to talk to someone they cut off with \"SORRY WE LOST YOU...\"pretty sad that you pay Lowe's for a warranty and you get this bad service which reflects bad service on them also. Hopefully someone from Lowe's will see this also. Next contact will be the BBB... MAYBE EVERYONE SHOULD FILE A COMPLAINT. LOWE'S SHOULD STOP USING THIS COMPANY!!"

How can I be helpful and constructive when Assurant is anything but. I will be honest. After paying $199 deductible Friday afternoon I was told my phone would arrive by Fedex next Monday. Tuesday rolls around and another heavily accented fellow is telling me the phone is not available and they don't know when it will be. I ask to cancel the claim so I can proceed with the vacation that I've delayed for four days and I'm told they will reimburse me in 1 to 10 business days. Shame on you Samsung."
