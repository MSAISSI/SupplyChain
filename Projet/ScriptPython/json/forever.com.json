The Artisan, you would be able to activate as it is licensed for two computers. Once I deactivate Historian from the old computer, you will be able to activate on the new one.

He said that 1080 or a 2 K should be plenty big enough.  He told me to check again and make sure.  He said that the OK button not being there is your problem and not mine and that is what I told the woman that I was talking to last week.

          "Contenu": "Honestly, I would both be happy to recommend this service and it was just much slower than I anticipated.I didn't realize that when I sent my item in for digitization that it would take a month from when they received it to when it would be completed.Maybe that is totally fine ... after all, I didn't even know that recording existed for about 3 decades so how much of a rush could I really be in to digitize it?But I also live in an Amazon world where I can get most things delivered same day.Now my understanding was the long que was an consequence of their move to a new purpose built digitization facility intended to deal with that backlog.  So if you are reading this soon and are impatient then ask customer service what the wait time is.If you have more patience than I or you are reeding this a few months down the line this problem may not apply to you at all.But when I think of my experience it gets 3 stars.Here are the things that kept if from a higher score:1. Long wait to have my item digitized that was not clear before I shipped it in.2. Signing up for an account so I could formalize my order and pay for it ... the directions I was given didn't actually get me there so it took a few days of back and forth.3. Product was sufficiently unclear that I was not sure what I should order and bought a USB drive from them that I didn't need to and that significantly and needlessly boosted the cost.4. I was surprised to learn that given they have a product that is lifetime hosting of stuff that you upload to their servers that they only host stuff they digitize for you for a short time (so download it quickly).  The disk space on a Forever basis for a small digitization project like mine would have only cost a few cents, so I was surprised that it didn't just come with the account roped into the cost I'd already paid.  Ultimately not really a problem I just downloaded it from Forever on to my computer then uploaded it to my Google Drive and shared the link to the files with my Google Drive with my family.  My internet is fast enough that that was a pretty minor annoyance, but I don't know why it needed to be.  I could have just shared a link with file location and password data for view only privileges with Forever to my family.  I'd think that would have made more business sense for them because they'd get to advertise their logo and brand to all my family ... but now I don't even have a good reason to mention them.I know it seems odd to both recommend a company and give them only 3 stars, but that is what I got when I asked my gut what to give."

After each project added I had to go back to my profile, my projects and find which project I wanted to add. Also, when purchasing prints, each photo cannot have a different number of copies unless you add each photo to the cart separately. Wonderful if you want to print an entire album.

You can\u2019t edit your books at all on the app, making it a waste of space on my tablet. using the website on my tablet was better but still had its difficult moments \u2014 you can\u2019t move the pages farther than the row they\u2019re in and every time I press the \u201cmove\u201d button the website refreshes. The best way to use Forever is on my computer, which was not convenient for me since my pictures were all on my iPad/phone. The app and website are clean and straightforward, but the UI is difficult to get around, especially if you aren\u2019t very tech-savvy. I appreciate the selection of interesting collages to place my photos in, but it would be nice if I could choose where to include and not include text. I felt limited by what I could create, and I was afraid the book I ended up making would look repetitive. The book theme I chose didn\u2019t offer a page that could put 8 pictures on, but they had 7 and 9. I found this odd and also limiting.The shipping was awful. Yes, it was quick, but the way my books were shipped was sloppy. A piece of cardboard and one piece of flimsy tape was all that was used to protect my books. I made these with my grandma, they mean a lot to my family and me, and if a book was lost or ruined we would be devastated. We were extremely lucky to have our books delivered unharmed.This could be a fantastic website, but the UI needs to be looked at and updated. I\u2019m extremely disappointed with how my books were shipped, I really think that needs to be looked into as well. The books printed beautifully, my grandma and I worked really hard on them and we\u2019re satisfied with the end result, but it could I\u2019ve all be ruined by sloppy packaging. I believe this app/site could be something really great, but only after these things are looked into and fixed."

I was informed that I could put as many photos as I could fit in the box. No one ever mentioned there would be an additional charge or how much it would be. I should have been informed of the additional charge rate before I sent the box. I would have not sent so many photos. I was shocked at how much it ended up costing for the digitizing. Never again."

One is that I seem to have to download each of the 40 recordings separately and they are not named as they are on Forever. I understand they are hoping I will purchase long-term storage, but it just made an experience I paid a lot of money for a bit more cumbersome.Second, the cost is the same for transferring VHS tapes that I had literally 2 or 3 minutes of recording on vs. much longer recordings. Just a little disappointing to have to spend so much for those much shorter ones. I found the customer service to be impeccable. They were clear and quickly responded to all my questions in a friendly manner. I would recommend this service to others and am grateful to have so many memories that had been lost to us for decades."

Reasons for only 2 stars:  Forever changes the meta data associated with your photos so you lose the location data.  Artisan software is expensive and buggy.  To crop a photo, I had to first crop it in another program then use that photo otherwise the Artisan cropped photo was not what I had cropped.  The software does not automatically update even though I have update turned on.  My biggest complaint is that when using Artisan, the first and last page have what I thought was a watermark stating \"This page intentionally left blank\" so I left those 2 pages alone thinking they had to be blank and would be  blank because of the message on the page because of the printing processes.  I got my book in the mail and the first and last pages had the watermark stating the page was intentionally left blank.  I went back into Artisan to see if the messages could be deleted but they can't.  The \"safe zone\" really isn't \"safe\".  A few of my picture boarders were cut off (not a huge deal since is wasn't very noticeable).Update:  I have been working with Forever about the \"watermarks\".  They have agreed to reprint the book at no charge.  Because of this, I have increased my rating."

          "Contenu": "I purchased a hardback, layflat digital scrapbook with 54 pages. I have bought 23 of these books from Forever and had a problem with only three of them. One made my 5 year old granddaughter looks like a teenager because it looked like she had lipstick on. On the second book, the printing colors were off (I think). On my latest book I purchased in January, the problem was that the binding of the book was not glued down to the spine of the cover of the book. I was going to call in about it but decided it would be ok as long as it was not handled roughly. I love Forever and Artisan and would not use any other company. The customer service is professional, quick and fixes any problem you may have. Only good things to say about Forever - its just some small things that needed attention."

I decided to try making copies of my Creative Memories paper photo books to have online also, in case something would ever happent to the books.  I felt it was pretty expensive and the pages were big (12x12) so I could not put all of them in the largest box.  Thank you for the 40% off, but still it was a couple hundred dollars.  I realize it is an expense on FOREVER's side too.  Sending and delivering the box is amazing and I fully trust Forever to get my precious memories back to me.  The pages came back the way I sent them and thank you.  The only issue was when Forever put the pages on my online account the pages were not in order as I sent.  I had baby pages mixed up with kindergarten etc...I don't know how to get them in order, which will also take time to correct that and figure that out.   The pages were well done though and clear.  I still believe in what Forever is doing and thankful to know my photos/videos are safe on this site.  S. Hayes"

The Historian software is great for manipulating your pictures to improve and achieve the results one is looking for. The quality of their products, such as, mugs, ornaments, scrapbooks, etc. is beyond compare.I used the scrapbooking software long before it was acquired by Forever and have a library of books I have created over the years. While I believe, even in the early years before if was acquired by Forever, that the quality was good, there is no comparison to the quality today. Their service is amazing. When I have had questions, they have helped me work through them with patience. I have used email, the chat room and at times talked directly to the support team. They are very knowledgeable and helpful.Did I mention their online storage? It is worth every penny to buy it. I buy a little at a time. As I create my books, I load only those pictures into my storage. I use the best pictures in my books, they are the one I want to preserve for those that follow me.In my opinion, Forever is the BEST quality product on the market today. I tell everyone about Forever. If you are not utilizing their services, you may just be missing out on something you might find amazing as well.To clarify, I am NOT an ambassador for the company but believe whole heartedly in them."
