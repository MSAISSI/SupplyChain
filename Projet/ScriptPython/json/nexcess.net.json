I called them as their sales chat was not working (most times it doesn't work). They told me they are better than cloudways and I should move to them. I got convinced by them and moved to them. Placed order and then they said they can't provide me hosting because their system believes My IP is blacklisted OR I had previous account with them OR billing address has problem. I told them that there is no such thing like what they are mentioning. IP is good, address is good and I never had account with them before. But they are not humans, they reply on robotic work. All that are saying after convincing me to switch to them and taking invoice payment from me. I left cloudways for them and they made me stuck, fortunately next day I found better hosting provider. Don't go with these guys, they have no common sense. They don't care about your time, they care more on their robotic system and robotic type humans."

Then support ticket staff replying to the same problem with different responses contradicting the other.The company has too many different people working in support. It needs to be streamlined and get staff on board who have the skills they advertise - WordPress etc.Also, escalation to their 'onboarding manager' and other senior staff resulted in one email reply from one person. No one else in the thread. Nothing after that.Most of the solutions were then actually done by our own staff in-house.If you have a large website, compay reputation depending on it - do not use this host. Look at someone who really does care about new customers amd providing support that you expect."

How am I going to pay it if no unpaid invoice appeared in the Nexcess client area.In addition, I made a query about the DNS for the migration and after half an hour they unsubscribed the old server, with which 6 websites were automatically down, unavailable. They did not notify me, they simply told me that they were confiscating the server on a Friday. Bad day to carry out this type of action. They did not notify me.Then I make the DNS change and the SSL certificate fails on a website and I had to send numerous tickets to get the problem resolved. Each support technician said something different and no one solved the problem. I've been with Future Hosting for 10 years and nothing like this has ever happened. It is unfortunate. A bad service."

I needed to set up an autoresponder email because I was going on vacation and something as simple as that has become a nightmare. Firstly, Nexcess platform does not allow setting up an autoresponder from my main domain, instead the response email is sent from the default Nexcess hosting domain; this means our customers will email \"@mydomain.pt\" and get a response from \"@XXXXX.nxcli.net\" which is completely unprofessional in my opinion. We contacted Nexcess support, and a collaborator said that they could change the settings themselves to have the autoresponder come from our main domain. When the time came to activate the autoresponder, the email was still coming from the wrong email address and while we were already on vacation Nexcess support said they couldn't do a thing about it. One week later of having the autoresponder coming from the wrong email address, we came back and asked to turn off the autoresponder; two days have passed and it is still active; we cannot turn it off because this was set by the support team. Overall this was a terrible experience, I wouldn't recommend using Nexcess email service, and the customer support was totally unhelpful in this case, in fact they made it worst."

The response time to my tickets was extremely slow, and I would sometimes have to wait up to 2-4 days for a reply.Furthermore, my website would crash whenever there were more than 800 or more concurrent users, even though I had the most expensive plan they offer. This was unacceptable, and their technical staff could not fix the issue. They promised me multiple times that they had resolved the issue, but it kept happening repeatedly.During a livestream event with paid members, my website was down for more than a day, which is totally unacceptable. Their services are not reliable!After switching to Hostinger recently, I had no issues with my website, and it could handle up to 5000+ concurrent users without any problem. It's clear that Nexcess hosting does not have the capacity or technical expertise to handle high-traffic websites.I should also mention that I had a similar experience with Futurehosting, which ran the service before Nexcess took over. At least with Futurehosting, the support team answered queries quickly, but the site still crashed in same way like with Nexcess. They do not have the capacity or technical staff to fix anything or help out when needed.I advise everyone to stay away from Nexcess hosting. Their services are unreliable, their technical support is inadequate, and their pricing is not worth the hassle. Choose other hosting services that can provide better support and handle high-traffic websites."

          "Contenu": "HORRENDOUS HOST since acquired by Liquid Web / Nexcess. Been with Futurehosting + Nexcess for over 13 years and all it took for 1 DMCA complaint and they shut us down in 2 hours after serving notice. It is 12 am at my place when served the notice and shut us down at 2:30am... Seriously horrendous service and hosting provider. Reading other's reviews, I am not sure if I will get my files back. They just destroyed a $150,000 business in 2 hours of time. Don't ever host on Nexcess / liquid web if you have any business that's making money. They will shut you down within 2 hours notice. It a freaking crazy unreliable company. There are many reliable hosting out there.  Don't bother with these guys. They will DESTROY your business. It might not happen now but it WILL happen one day when you are unexpected. These guys are unreliable as a server crash. It will happen anytime and they will come and shut you down within 2 hours notice. No negotiation, no what, no if. They will treat you like dirt. Like you are destroying their business but they don't care if they are destroying other people's business. They just destroyed a $150,000 business with a 2 hours short notice. These guys are a joke.-TonyUPDATE: So nexcess hosted us for 10+ years and then suddenly determine our business is not right for them and terminate us in 2 hours. As a long time customer, maybe, just maybe, as a courtesy, could have provided a proper warning and enough notice period for us to move? IF YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOUR BUSINESS, BE WARNED THESE GUYS WILL NOT TREAT YOU PROPERLY. As other reviewer has said, they will terminate you and destroy your business within 2 hours!"

          "Contenu": "Another review to express my deep frustration and disappointment with the ongoing attempts to charge my credit card, despite the fact that I have cancelled my plan with Nexcess. This continuous and unauthorized billing practice is not only unethical but also amounts to an act of theft and a blatant violation of my consumer rights.I had initially signed up for a plan with Nexcess with the understanding that it would provide the services and support as promised. However, the experience has been nothing short of a nightmare. Not only did I encounter numerous technical issues and poor customer service, but the problems persisted even after my decision to terminate my subscription. This persistence in charging my credit card without my consent or authorization is completely unacceptable.I have made multiple attempts to resolve this matter with your customer support team, but I have been met with indifference and unhelpful responses. Despite providing clear evidence of my cancellation and requesting an immediate halt to any further charges, this company has continued to disregard my rights as a customer.I demand that you cease all attempts to charge my credit card immediately and refund any unauthorized charges that have been made since the cancellation of my plan. If this matter is not resolved promptly and to my satisfaction, I will have no choice but to escalate the issue by reporting Nexcess to the appropriate consumer protection authorities, as well as asking my  legal counsel to recover the funds that have been wrongly taken from my account. I am prepared to pursue all available avenues to hold Nexcess accountable for its unethical and illegal actions."

          "Titre": "Nexcess is one of my biggest business regrets",
          "Contenu": "I signed up with Nexcess due to the glowing recommendations from my network and sites like Trust Pilot. I was moving over 30 sites away from WP Engine due to costs associated with that many sites on a single server. I wish I'd chosen a different company.Things already seemed a bit off during the migration process. The initial copying of my sites over to Nexcess caused a multitude of different and seemingly random issues on all but two of my sites - content switched to lorem ipsum, functionality disappearing despite the plugin behind it still being enabled, posts set to the wrong author, just all kinds of strange stuff that shouldn't happen with a routine migration. It took me over 10 hours to identify all of the issues across my sites to request they be fixed. When it came time to actually migrate the sites, two of the migration staff I worked with were lovely, but the other one was really frustrating. He didn't communicate with me for three hours after my migration was scheduled to start, and then when I reached out to cancel the migration that night since it was already so late, he began putting all of my sites in maintenance mode and even taking some of them offline without responding to me. Things didn't improve once I was up and running on Nexcess. My sites kept experiencing short downtimes, but support would gaslight me whenever I reached out to find out what had happened. \"I don't see anything in the server logs, must have just been your internet.\" Right, that's why two separate uptime monitoring services both reported the site down...One of my sites that had been using PHP 7.4 for over a year on WP Engine began having spontaneous intermittent downtime one day. Support attributed it to a PHP 7.4 issue and told me I must have changed the PHP version and broke it (I didn't?). The site began to work again a few hours later, and Nexcess was never able to explain to me what happened to cause the issue. They said they saw nothing in the logs. It's still a mystery what took my eCommerce site offline in the middle of a business day.Pushing staging sites to production with Nexcess is, unfortunately, also a deeply frustrating experience. Unlike other hosts, there's no way to click a couple of buttons and push from one environment to another. You have to use WP Merge or Blogvault. WP Merge is powerful and a nice perk, but it's extremely complex to use and it's really easy to muck up your database with it. Blogvault is really easy, but takes much longer to copy a site from staging to production, and the site is down the entire time when doing so. At one point, Blogvault was giving me an error when trying to copy from staging to production. I reached out to support for help, but they couldn't figure it out. They suggested I try WP Merge, which overwrote all of the staging changes (despite supposedly copying from staging to production, not the other way around), forcing me to restore a day-old backup and re-do several hours worth of work. With both options not working, Nexcess had no solution for pushing my site to production to meet its launch schedule. Fortunately, the staff at Blogvault were very helpful and gave me a free trial to attempt migrating without using Nexcess as a middle-man, which worked perfectly. 22 hours later, someone at Nexcess support finally figured out what was wrong with Blogvault. I needed to include https:// in \"destination site url\" field, but not the \"host/server address\" field, or it wouldn't work. 22 hours and a late launch just because of their finicky setup (regular Blogvault worked perfectly whether https:// was included or not).The straw that finally broke the camel's back - and mind you, I only joined 3 months ago - was a huge outage last week. All of my sites were offline for over 2 hours sporadically throughout the day. Nexcess's status page was not informative about the status or reason behind the outage, and their support staff, as usual, couldn't tell me anything. Over a week later, the issue behind the outage hasn't been resolved and we experienced another, albeit shorter, outage yesterday that again took all of my sites offline multiple times. When the outage recurred yesterday and I first reached out to Nexcess to see if it was the same issue, they again began by blaming it on my personal internet before admitting there was another outage. I asked for information about the outage so I could explain to my clients what happened and what was being done to prevent it, and they closed my ticket without responding.I'm finally taking the time to migrate all of my sites away from Nexcess only 3 months after joining, and I'm counting the hours until I never have to deal with this platform again."

          "Contenu": "Further correspondence has been useless. Later I find the complainer's own website has been offline since 16th March 2020. The website is entirely inaccessible. So I wonder how this could be called a valid \"DMCA takedown notice\"!Guess what? I find other funny things: 1) the complainer leaves no email address. 2) the name of the complainer is a famous German mathematician born in 19393) the number of the complainer is a suspicious number, flagged multiple times, given a simple googling4) the address the complainer leaves is a virtual business addressSo we are basically complained by an unknown, who shows their copyrighted works on a website that has been offline for more than a half year, who leaves no email address, whose name happens to be the same with a German mathematician, whose number has been flagged multiple times, and whose business address is virtual, and who starts the complaining letter with the familiar \"To Whom It May Concern\". The Director of Nexcess Support, along with another staff member from the Security Team, introduced as being very familiar with the DMCA requirements, thinks the DMCA takedown notice seems well formatted and is serious and valid!I hope all these are not coincidences. I hope Nexcess stuff members do would like to be helpful when issues occur, instead of debating. I hope Nexcess stuff members do check problems and facts. I hope Nexcess, as a company, does want to be supportive, instead of being slaved by their own policies. Unless my issue has been solved right away with compensation, or unless you don't care about fake DMCA notices that cause the banning of your website, you are not recommended to use Nexcess. I swear all the above facts are real."

          "Contenu": "I gave it 10 months on a one year plan and was continually getting \"autoscale notification\" messages.  I would check the web sites and not see anything that would indicate significant traffic at the time.  So I migrated back to the old server and changed the DNS to point there, yet even for the last 1.5 months when the DNS wasn't pointed to nexuses.net, I got some \"autoscale usage notifications.\"  Given there wasn't any traffic going there, it doesn't seem possible it was accurate.  Likewise, the notifications would often say \"We previously sent you a note to let you know that your site was experiencing additional visitors\" which wasn't accurate - nothing in the spam folder either.Finally, they did tout auto-updating of plugins, but that rarely worked except when I set it up in WP myself.One caveat, the support people were always very nice and very helpful, but the servers they were using were seemingly underpowered and the tools they were using didn't seem accurate.  Hopefully they get the issues fixed and if so, I'd give it a try in a few years.Without those issues, I would've stayed there, but those were deal breakers for me.Thanksedit:As you can see from their reply, they are definitely on top of things and always have been pleasant and friendly.  They haven't ever answered why the autoscale notifications (a) claim one has already been sent when it hasn't, and (b) why autoscale is needed in the first place when there is limited traffic.  As above, I really hope they fix the issues I saw.  I had moved some sites from LiquidWeb CloudSites and some from AWS.  The performance on CloudSites had been better than nexcess seemed over the last 11 months subjectively, admittedly.  Nexcess did making moving there easy, so it probably wouldn't be difficult to move back at a later time.  For me, the main thing was the autoscale notifications on sites that weren't getting millions of visitors a day.  :-)"

          "Contenu": "I'm Jojo's workmate and I have to talk with Nexcess over the recent DMCA takedown notice falsely and deliberately made towards us from competition. Later today I did some research and found something very interesting about the complainant's identity:1) the website, on which the complainant says their copyrighted images are listed has been offline since March 20202) the complainant leaves no email address; the letter has been submitted via web form3) the address, when searched on Google, shows VIRTUAL OFFICES AND BUSINESS ADDRESSES FOR RENT4) the phone number, when searched on Google, is flagged, and promoted as a prank phone: Frank will politely tell the person calling that you do not wish to be contacted by them. Because it's neutral in terms of location and message, you can use it in all sorts of situations, for example in official forms. You can preview Frank\u2019s message here (a link); it\u2019s German of course.The above, when combined, has to mean something. So we are basically attacked by an unknown, via Nexcess. Nexcess should at least have confirmed the existence of the complainant in the first place before taking action on our website. But Nexcess did not and they think it's the way to do it. Meanwhile Nexcess Support keeps telling me \"the DMCA is complete and properly formatted, and as such we are processing it\", three or four times. Nexcess Support is basically telling me they don't care about the identity of a DMCA complainer, whether it's fake or not, whether they can reach the complainer or not (anyway they won't even try to reach a complainer, at least in our case). As long as the DMCA takedown notice seems properly formatted and complete, they remove anything requested in it.I need Nexcess to tell me straight if it's too late, they are already processing it so we have to wait for 10 days this time. I need Nexcess to tell me if it's due to their negligence and if they could have done better by investigating the complainant's identity a little bit."

          "Contenu": "I'm contacted by a member of the Support Leadership team at Nexcess, who lets me know the following: Per our procedures and to be aligned with DMCA compliance, we must act simply based on the correct formatting of the DMCA request itself which doesn't involve validating or investigating the complainant or submitter's identity. These are solely based on the formatting; there is no review or investigative work done on our end that we're required to validate the submitter.Strange enough that you care about only the formatting and would never go a little further to check some basics including the submitter's identity. It's the same to announce: everybody now please use Nexcess with a fake address, a fake name, and a fake email to SUCCESSFULLY attack your competitors hosted on Nexcess, as in my case; we don't question you as a submitter; we only target our clients. IS IT TRUE???And I'm thrown a page again about \"What should I do if I get a DMCA Takedown notice\" on DMCA official site, which says: ISP's / OSP's / Web Hosts do not have the right or responsibility to arbitrate the takedown process between parties or determine whether the takedown is valid or not. They most certainly can bring judgment as to whether the Takedown request or application is suitable, appropriate or meets the criteria set out on their website.Please note I'm not asking for arbitration this far. I'm questioning \"whether the Takedown request or application is suitable, appropriate or meets the criteria set out on their website\".Sure I find the following on Nexcess about their own \"Copyright Infringement Policy\".You request the following fields as necessary when a complainer is submitting a DMCA takedown notice:Your Full Legal Name*Your Contact Email Address*Your Contact Phone Number*Your Full Address:*The problem is: this complainer obviously didn't offer you an email address. If the email address is missing, how could you say it's complete and thus the DMCA is valid? Besides, if you don't even check the validity of these fields, then what's the point of wanting these fields as necessary in the first place?Let me say it again: the address they offered is virtual, the phone number is a prank phone number, the email is missing. SINCE YOU LIKE TO DIRECT ME TO THE OFFICIAL PAGE OF DMCA, please tell me if your vadality of the submitter is against \"They most certainly can bring judgment as to whether the Takedown request or application is suitable, appropriate or meets the criteria set out on their website.\"You told me \"Per our procedures and to be aligned with DMCA compliance, we must act simply based on the correct formatting of the DMCA request itself\".You must simply act on the correct formatting ONLY???Anyway, do you really think \"the takedown request or application is suitable, appropriate or meets the criteria set out on your own website\", with no email address, a prank a phone number or a virtual address? Please explain. I don't wanna be suggested to get back to the private mode with any of your staff members. I want a crisp explanation here. A straight explanation. Three answers to three simple questions: 1) According to DMCA official, is it true \"you must act on only the correct formatting and nothing else\"? 2) Do you really think this DMCA takedown notice, with no email address, a prank a phone number or a virtual address, meets with the statement on official DMCA site that \"bring judgment as to whether the Takedown request or application is suitable, appropriate or meets the criteria set out on their website?\"3\uff09Do you agree you have mishandled this case due to your own negligence? You answer me, one by one as to the three questions, do what you should do to fix it and this case is over. Normally clients will do what you tell them to do and you don't wanna deal with a serious client like us. The time you spend on us is NOT economical. Your clients or potential clients, however, do consider how you fix things and solve issues."

          "Contenu": "I'm a customer of Nexcess for over 5 years. Now I'm very confused, cringed, disappointed, and irritated by the way Nexcess treats their customer.Here's the story. Yesterday, my website was forbidden, as a result of a DMCA by a said copyright owner.Let's say what we do. We sell oil painting copies of artworks in public domain, artworks by Van Gogh, Monet and so forth. All the artists on our website have been dead for at least 70 years, so their artworks are in public domain, for anyone to use without permission. It's American law and there's no copyright owners of such artworks, for the copyrights have expired. And according to Title 17 \"United States Code, as amended by this Act, does not provide copyright protection for any work that is in the public domain in the United States.\" It's common sense.The DMCA was apparently by competition, not the first time. Too bad, Nexcess failed to do some very basic homework, and arbitrarily forbade our website. So far, I've sent a dozen messages but were successfully ignored.Since anyone can submit a DMCA and DMCA abuses are not rare, see how easily your website may be attacked by your competition. We are running a major Adwords Campaign. Converting usually takes one week. See our loss.I want our service to be restored soonest possible! And Let's see the \"infringing images\" and how Nexcess was unhelpful and unsupportive, and lazy:Page: artists > pierre-puvis-de-chavannesPierre Puvis de Chavannes (14 December 1824 \u2013 24 October 1898)Artist dead for over 70 yearsPage: artists > arshile-gorkyArshile Gorky (April 15, 1904 - July 21, 1948)Artist dead for over 70 yearsPage: artists > childe-hassamChilde Hassam (October 17, 1859 \u2013 August 27, 1935)Artist dead for over 70 yearsPage: artists > robert-henriRobert Henri (24 June 1865 - 12 July 1929)Artist dead for over 70 yearsPage: artists > ferdinand-hodlerFerdinand Hodler (14 March 1853 - 19 May 1918)Artist dead for over 70 yearsPage: artists > nicholas-roerichNicholas Roerich (October 9, 1874 \u2013 December 13, 1947)Artist dead for over 70 yearsPage: artists > john-frederick-kensettJohn Frederick Kensett (March 22, 1816 \u2013 December 14, 1872)Artist dead for over 70 yearsPage: collections > moise-kislingMo\u00efse Kisling (January 22, 1891 \u2013 April 29, 1953)This is a collection page, rather than an artist page.All artworks listed under this page are not artworks by Mo\u00efse Kisling,but by artists who have been dead for over 70 years.Page: artists > albert-marquetAlbert Marquet (27 March 1875 \u2013 14 June 1947)Artist dead for over 70 yearsPage: artists > gustave-moreauGustave Moreau (6 April 1826 \u2013 18 April 1898)Artist dead for over 70 yearsPage: artists > berthe-morisotBerthe Marie Pauline Morisot (January 14, 1841 \u2013 March 2, 1895)Artist dead for over 70 yearsPage: artists > jules-pascinJulius Mordecai Pincas (March 31, 1885 \u2013 June 5, 1930)Artist dead for over 70 yearsPage: artists > walter-sickertWalter Richard Sickert (31 May 1860 \u2013 22 January 1942)Artist dead for over 70 yearsPage: artists > egon-schieleEgon Schiele (12 June 1890 \u2013 31 October 1918)Artist dead for over 70 yearsPage: artists > paul-signacPaul Victor Jules Signac (11 November 1863 \u2013 15 August 1935)Artist dead for over 70 yearsPage: artists > alfred-sisleyAlfred Sisley (30 October 1839 \u2013 29 January 1899)Artist dead for over 70 yearsPage: artists > chaim-soutineCha\u00efm Soutine (13 January 1893 \u2013 9 August 1943)Artist dead for over 70 yearsPage: artists > tom-thomsonThomas John Thomson (August 5, 1877 \u2013 July 8, 1917)Artist dead for over 70 yearsUpdated on 2020/10/11:Finally someone contacted me explaining the following: I apologize for the delay. While we do value you being a client, the content in question does need to be disabled as the DMCA is properly formatted and complete I'm afraid, and Liquid Web is also legally liable and required to ensure it's disabled.Please do use your legal team, instead of your customer service team! You are receiving many DMCA takedown notices and it's better to have a basic discernment. Not based on formatting!It's easy in our case to understand the term \"public domain\", and it's easy to check if these artworks truly belong to public domain. It takes you a few minutes. I mean it took you a few minutes to shut down our service right? Anyway, isn't public domain a very basic point a hosting company like you should know? It's such a difficult conception? Or you just won't do anything very foundemental to protect your clients from DMCA abuses? It's 2020 and It's ridiculous to claim they own the copyrights of all Egon Schiele works. Egon Schiele died in 1918! it's been over 100 years! And you believe in it and shut down our service? Restore our service as soon as possible. We're waiting."

And that is hours. it is supposed that nexcess (liquidweb) bought this futurehosting company almost 3 years ago, so how come they should contact another team. The worst thing is that they take too long to respond and provide a solution.I just put a ticket (10:06 am East Time) for a problem that I can't make a backup of the public_html folder, I'll update as soon as it takes them to give me an answer to this simple request.Well, it's 12:32 am more than 2 hours and there is still no solution, they wrote to me saying that it is in the process of verification.The disagreement is that it is not only this time that there is a slow response, there have been many times, I have even had to resort to another type of support to solve it myself and I am not talking about complex problems, I am talking about simple problems, Said by those who have helped us on several occasions. When futurehosting was not part of Liquidweb, the support was excellent, they almost never took more than an hour to provide a solution, but with the change the service has gone from bad to worse. We have lost about 15 clients due to delays in solving simple failures. The contracted service is the full server managed with an extra charge for monitoring and support in third-party scripts; So it was contracted with futurehosting and when changing they never informed us of any change in the services"

It took several minutes just to get someone to verify that the site was down. Then they asked me if I had done something to cause the outage. This was a clue that the person might not know what they are doing, because my previous experience with Liquid Web hosting was that support reps usually know more about the situation faster than I can type in a chat. It took approx 30 minutes for the rep to create a trouble ticket. I was treated as if I was an employee who should know how everything works. I was not given courtesy guidance or instruction on next steps. I had to ask what to do. I did not receive a courtesy apology like \u201csorry for the inconvenience.\u201d Basically poor bedside manner. Once the site was back up, I asked why it had gone down and they said they did not know but a reboot of the server fixed it. Great. So why not just give me a button to reboot it myself? I am left having learned nothing and feeling less secure about my site\u2019s uptime. Next time this happens I will start shopping for a new managed Wordpress provider. What happened to the kind Liquid Web support team I grew dependent on over the past 14 years? I hope this was a one-off!"

It would have took 12 days to get an appropriate answer and then they provided an adequate solution in a matter of hours and I am happy with it.I do believe Nexcess would make world better by providing more detailed information during pre-sale and purchase to avoid confusion and errors. I do not think it's fair to sell an option at $x and charge it again at $y if disabled/enabled, by mistake or not.I think, fundamentally, Nexcess is a good solution provider, but the Sales team seems to be more oriented to get new customers quickly than to take time to sell what is best for the customer.My feelings toward Nexcess are playing yo-yo. But I can now give 3 stars instead of 1.-----ORIGINAL: Price information on website wrong when buying. Hidden fees. Lack of training and knowledge for many techs. Basically, the Sales team is doing a great job, but don't expect help if something goes wrong.Long delays to get answers and depending with whom you will talk or chat, the answer might differ.Cannot TRUST the information they provide."

          "Contenu": "UPDATE from 1 to 3 star review:Support did come through and fix our issue after escallating (Dutch was great), and offered a resolve for future issues. For that I'm bumping up my rating from 1 star to 3 - very much appreciate that. The issues I still have are that they point the finger at the platform (ExpressionEngine) although they offer/sell ExpressionEngine hosting, and are supposed to be an offical \"partner\" - therefore there shouldn't be any \"special needs\" for EE over WordPress or Magento environments, and staff should be equally knowledeable on all platforms they tote to support. There are also still the issues that: most of their staff does't seem to be aware that there are special needs for EE environments, and that they have outdated/misleading documentation on their website (which they will point you to/misguide you to, via ticket or chat). So, while we're satisfied for now to have a resolve/work-around for when we do run into issues due to these \"special\" needs - it still isn't quite (or not yet) the same awesome hosting & support for EE that it used to be. For being a \"partner\" hosting company for ExpressionEngine, it should be fully/equally supported, online documentation should be current (or at least noted if outdated). At the least, support staff should all be aware of these \"special needs\" for EE and if/when documentation is outdated so they're not misguiding customers.Previous 1 star review:Used to absolutely LOVE nexcess and has been our preferred hosting and who we recommend to all of our clients. But as of lately, support is completely worthelss, and they've even broken a LIVE site of ours and left it that way for HOURS before it came to our attention. They used old code from your outdated docs that I had already explained broke the site, but they put it back and did not test and just left it that way - that is absolutely NOT OK! We should never have to worry about that. All support experiences lately have been pretty bad and therefore we are starting to look elsewhere, we can no longer recommend your product or services to our clients."

Email is also a bit of a challenge to connect to unless you're an IT person. Have you considered an option for third-party email hosting to separate the email storage from the account limits? We used to use EngineHosting, which used Rackspace to handle emails. Just a thought. Still, I'd recommend and have recommended Nexcess to many people. Y'all keep up the stellar work!"

She asked me to send in a ticket.  By the time the ticket got there another agent took it and emailed me to reassure me they will handle it.  When he was done, he sent me another email to confirm and explained my next step.  Thank you soooo much for mitigating my anxiety!"

I never use more than 2 hours even on the busiest month, but even if the site is down for a minute you can lose so much business and it adds up.2. The support is always super helpful, friendly, professional and almost instantaneous. They go out of their way to help to implement things that other hosting won't. 3. Their management always steps in immediately to resolve any negative feedback.4. They don't have cPanel so it was a learning curve, but now I love their dashboard. And ftp credentials are easily accessible.5. Backups, restores and staging sites are so simple to manage.5. Having a built-in CDN is so convenient.6. Free Astra Pro plus other special offers included.7. And super fast!Thank you so much!"

That's extremely important especially if your site is down and your losing thousands per hour.  In my case, my site was initially down and then my email after they setup my site.   Monetary wise, it didn't affect me since I'm in the initial stages of setting up my business but once I get to the selling stage, I can count on there email support.  I do recall using the chat/phone support last year when deciding who I should use as my host and they answered right away and were extremely informative.   I suppose I would get faster service via chat/phone.  Either way, whether email, phone, or chat, they are extremely prompt in getting you the help you need."

I ran into a WordPress issue/conflict that I wasn't sure was software or server environment, so I contacted Nexcess for help.The tech Jay was amazing.  Not only did he work to reproduce the issue, but he dug into what was causing it and fixed the conflict for me!Many companies, as soon as they see it isn't a problem with their service will push you to someone else, which they easily could have done.  But instead, Jay took ownership of the problem to help me out.This is why I have been a client of LiquidWeb/Nexcess for over 20 years and will continue to grow with them."

He listened to my problem, email bounce-back, asked for the message I received about the bounce and went to work. A few minutes later he told me about the change he made in my email set up. About 4 hours later I received an email from Frank making sure all was well. He was a terrific person to work with! Thank you for great service."
