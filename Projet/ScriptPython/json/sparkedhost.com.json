The server failed to even start, I asked support for help and let them do their thing for almost an hour. I waited for the situation to be resolved. After failing to even start the server after an hour, I asked for a refund and wanted to swap hosting providers. Now after a few back-and-forths they sent \"Please refer to our TOS, you are not allowing us to help, and neither is this caused by us.We can only offer a refund in the form of store credit.\"What a rubbish hosting service with the most predatory refund policy imaginable. Was I meant to keep letting them help for the next hour too? Then perhaps for the next day or week. Either way, if I get fed up and want to leave I can't because then I would have rejected support which means I'm unable to get a refund."

Also, if you have 2 tickets open, even if the other ticket is about something entirely different. They'll tell you to add your inquiry to that ticket instead. So you'll have 2 subjects running in 1 ticket and have to wait for that person to also respond.cPanel is just awfully unclear.Lot's of improvement needed in their support team.Edit: Support uses \"school time\" as an excuse for late ticket replies.Edit 2: After 5 hours of terrible service I decided it was enough and moved to a different hosting company. I requested a refund after the service being purchased the SAME DAY. They said they will only provide me a store credit refund.HORRIBLE COMPANY, NO BRAINS AT ALL!EDIT 3: They have completely banned me from their platform and I can't even access invoices etc.This is unlawful, I'd recommend everyone to stay FAR AWAY from this company."

          "Contenu": "Hosting was alright, but ran into a few issues. They did resolve the issues, but their service when it came to cancelling a subscription was horrible.I requested a cancellation, they sent a confirmation, and then didn't cancel it. They charged me for 2 extra months before I contacted PayPal to force their hand and cancel the subscription.The \"CEO\" then had the audacity to ask why I contacted PayPal and was incredibly rude. Unbelievable.UPDATE:As I've read through many other reviews they seem to have a habit of hiding behind PayPal and their automatic payments as a way of money grabbing.A company should not be so negligent as claiming that since I changed from Stripe to PayPal that they have no control over their own subscription service.A refund was offered for a single month when I clearly explained I was charged for two.UPDATE 2:The \"CEO\" removed his own response to this review and then tried to flag it as a fake review, I also had my account removed from their site so I can no longer access their ticketing system.Proof has been provided to TrustPilot to keep this review up.Incredibly shady business practices."

          "Contenu": "Proceed with caution! Just read their replies and you'll know what I meant by they do not care about their customers :) they never once apologised for doing things wrongly and have been trying to push the blame onto me and Insist that I acknowledge I got my dates off by 1 day! They wish for me to acknowledge that my service ends on 23rd not 24th. Okay it ends on 23rd 11:59pm, I acknowledge I got the dates wrong. They also are trying to blame me for:1. Me Not reaching out AGAIN after I already reached out and they couldn't resolve my issue. I also apparently bashed them! 2. Their tech issue with service cancellation, and blaming it on me for cancelling my service. 3. For them banning my IP address on their website because I left them a bad review. And instead of them reaching out, I have been given all the emails to write in to so I should stop whining. 4. For being dramatic and aggressive, thus resulting in a ban on discord because clearly I am supposed to go to their website to submit a ticket for help even though I'm banned. Mind you they have all my details, my email my, discord and no one has reached out to clarify and instead they're demanding I reach out instead. ========== Actual Review========Hosting platform is wonky. Files take time to update and doesn't update real time like some other hosting platforms. Tried changing versions but doesn't work. I requested for help on live chat and they claimed to have manually installed my requested version (forge 1.16.5), but on the version stated paper 1.20.2. I asked the live support and they mentioned that it states 1.20.2 because it's manually installed and that i can run my mods as per normal. I placed the mods into the mods server and no mods loaded. I got back to them and they did not respond for abit. So i uploaded forge 1.16.5 and server jar files into the platform and the server wouldn't run, clearly showing that the platform was set to another version and thus i am unable to run 1.16.5 forge. I gave up and closed the support chat. The staff however was very professional during the interactions.Edit***My service ends on 24/11/23, i tried to enter the website to download my server files on 24/11/23 HOWEVER, they banned my IP address, Deleted my client and billing account, thus i could not retrieve any files. They had previously tried to ask for more information on trust pilot, and the email states that my review will be removed if i dont respond within 3 days. Since I was no longer facing any issues as i got help from the discord community, i decided to let the timer run out and let the review get taken down instead. To my horror, on 24/11, they removed my account entirely, blocked my IP, and when i went to their discord to express my displeasure, they blocked and banned me from the discord server. Please proceed at your own risk!!! These people do not take responsibility and do not care about their customers AT ALL. I originally intended not to let the review go up since i wasn't facing any issues, but they entirely banned me from every single one of their platforms. Please beware!Their reply is \"User did not contact us for any help on any of our methods.\", i literally have chat transcript that i can provide to prove that i contacted support.*** More edits:Why would I send a ticket for more support if the discord community gave me the solution? I'm literally basing the review based off my experience. Cloud faces issue , Customer service couldn't get my server right, but solved by community. If the issue is resolved WHY would i send another ticket if i have no other issue? In addition, what is \"Banned due to wrong reasoning for automatic cancellation\"? how is that my issue? All i did was click on a button and it automatically submitted a cancellation request, which was then instantly approved. Furthermore, sure, IPs get randomly banned especially VPN. It just so happens that my IP which is not a VPN, gets banned on the exact day my service ends. And instead of reaching out, the people in-charge decides to ban me from the discord server when i expressed my problems. The story is not adding up.=====================================**Last Edit: \"Bash\" \"Dramatic\" ?In what way was i *BASHING* your support? I said they were professional throughout the interaction, but were unable to resolve the issues that i was facing, which i then went to discord to get help instead. Is that what BASHING entails? And how do you expect your customers not to be dramatic if you literally ban them everywhere on the day their service ends and they can't even access the platform to retrieve their files? Even choosing to ban them on discord to shut them up instead of reaching out to understand their concerns? I do not have any thing to discuss further. I will cooperate with trustpilot to ensure this review is retained."

          "Contenu": "This is an update of my previous review, I forgot to change it.I would have recommended this host previously, but a lot of things changed.First of all, the CEO tagged me in a semi-public chat with other Customers telling me I made a \"bad choice\" when I was switching hosts, alongside a couple other things.Second, when I left the discord server in which the previous incident happened, they started talking about me and insulting my character. And saying I was crazy because I have pronouns in my bio on discord. Third of all, while this is a bit unrelated, they publically stated that they would not participate in Pride Month because it's \"virtue signaling\" and said it's an \"inconvenience\" to change the server's icon for a few days. Fourth of all, the original reason I did switch was due to massive amounts of downtime in the Budget Miami region, causing the server to be down nearly weekly. I cannot confirm whether or not this is true anymore due to me moving all my servers to a different host.In short, because of the unprofessionalism, transphobia and lack of quality coming from this host, I will not be using them anymore for anything. I only partially moved at first, I will be doing a FULL move now. Thanks for nothing.UPDATE: They have now completely deleted my accounts with them and banned me from their discord server, as well as marking my review as \"harmful\" \ud83d\ude11. They did give me a refund for the services that I just bought, so I guess there is some credit there."

          "Contenu": "Today I bought bought a Minecraft server, when using the version installer, the server stuck several times and the only way to fix it temporarily was to open a ticket. Then it turns out that the plugin installer doesn't install all plugins, some even though the download button appears it doesn't work, like EssentialsX, a very used plugin, a notification appears that it installed successfully but the plugins folder is empty, if you can't do something that simple then don't put a plugin installer. Finally, when using the Modpacks installer the server got stuck again, this made me realize that the panel has several bugs, the most important features don't work properly, talking to 3 people from the Discord community by DM, they mention me that there is no way to fix the crashes, the only temporary solution is to open ticket every time it happens, I'm supposed to pay for a service that is functional, curiously the features that have these bugs, in the demo panel you can't use them, so you will only realize once you buy the service LOL. Regretting the purchase, I ask for my money back and they insist on giving me a credit balance, ie throw my money away. I don't recommend it if you expect to use the panel 100%. The response time on tickets is very decent, the only good thing of the day."

Our offer has been made clear------------I also declined that and told him to report me if he wants, but that I would keep my review up. After that my IP was banned and my account closed (meaning i lost ~3.66 Euro in Credits and about ~2.64 Euro in my May renewal, I can't check the exact numbers since my account was closed). Luckily, I have the entire Ticket exported for evidence.EDIT/UPDATE:I was contacted by Nik (staff that replied to this review), he said some things and said that there are a few rumors that he belived may have come from me.

When we started hosting with sparked there weren't any outages at all. After 4 months we had the first outage which is fine as it can happen to any host. After that month though there have been outages every month and it takes sparked several hours even up to 10 hours to even acknowledge the problem and after that, it can take from 5 hours to 2 days until they actually fix it.The CEO being back didn't change much at all if anything sadly.This would all be okay if it didn't happen so often and the communication wasn't so bad. My advice is to avoid hosting with sparked and instead look elsewhere.PS. They also report all bad reviews after about a month so some valid bad reviews get removed as the authors miss the email about it :)OLD Review:Sparkedhost has been terrible since the start of May. Customer support just doesn't care anymore, their servers are not stable anymore and their technicians are the slowest I have ever seen. Also in many different areas, they rely on one person that knows stuff. If that person were to resign the company would totally break apart. 90% of the support staff are just like the first line in support that ask you to restart your router.Used to be a stable and good host but lately, they just get worse and worse."

After finding out that I got billed after having a discussion and submitting a ticket to cancel the subscription a month beforehand, I asked for a refund the day it was taken out. A good company, looking to have a recurring customer may have done so, but this company hides behind a auto-recurring payment form that you automatically fill out when purchasing a service from them, apparently. imgur(dot)com/a/mPUWhPJ\"A refund will not be given, but I would recommend cancelling your subscription. Creating a dispute on PayPal will not do you anything either, we win 100% of the disputes for \"Cancelled approved payment\" as we give two warnings as shown above, and also you only cancelled the service, not the pre-approved payment on PayPal and our email confirmation and Terms of Service tells you that. You did get credit though on our site from the payment.\" - 'CEO' Paul Tracy Imagine a Minecraft hosting service (a game where many children and teens come to play) swindling them out of some money by embedding info under layers of information. Pretty scummy. This time, don't email me 10 times about changing my review, either.EDIT 2: Also, turns out I did remove my payment details from the site, but like I said previously, that's just a distraction until the next payment goes through via PayPal."

I am use to using the multicraft cpanel, much easier to use and understand. I also did not read there terms of service and also did not read the refund policy. I will not fault the company for my failure to read before paying for services, that is on me! The reason for the one star review is because of two main reasons:a. Refund Policy - There refund policy is anti-consumer. Here is there refund policy: \"By agreeing to our T.O.S we only offer a 24 hour money back guarantee on our services if billing finds a valid reason for a refund (such as technical issues on our side). Any issues after this timeframe, you will be given extra days on your service.\"If a company stands behind there services, they would be willing to offer a better refund policy. I do want to be fair and point out that Pebbles Hosting also has a similar refund policy, which my thoughts are the same for them as well. Make sure you read there terms of service BEFORE getting services. Do not do what I did. Of course I will not be doing business with them, but I also wont dispute the charge as I have myself to blame for the most part. b. Replies to Reviews - Any respectable company would simply apologize, try to make things right or try to have the customer contact them so they can try and help resolve the issues at hand and with any misunderstandings. This company seems to not be that and loves to rather put blame on the customer. I understand a customer is not always right, I get people like myself failed to read the policies and terms of use and thus had to deal with such failure to do so, but your policies are not only anti-consumer, they're also shady."

Notification of this would be very nice so I know to shut my server down.The reason I left was because they raise your prices without notifying you ahead of time. The first one was only 2 dollars, but I thought it was a mistake so I notified them about it. They respond by saying they do not have to notify me and can raise the prices whenever they want. They removed the 2 dollars for one month after I argued it was shady business practices. Then put it back on the following month.A couple months later they did it again. So two prices raises in two months. This time a 6 dollar a month price raise. So I left the host and mentioned the price raises were the reason I was leaving then he responded \"Hello,Regarding your cancellation request, we can change our prices whenever, it's a free market. And second, you paid the price of $48 last month too. Thanks,CEO @ Sparked Host LLC\"I responded \"I'm aware that you raised my price the month before, had to find a good host to move to and your free market comment, yes, you are right. That being said, it is a free market so I am allowed to give my business to your better competitors who notify their customers of price changes and change prices infrequently instead of every couple months.\"I would stay away from this company. There are many better hosts that infrequently change prices and give you plenty of warning when they are going to.Update: as you can see below this company has shady business practices, look at the dates on the reviews, I posted this in early June of 2019 and they responded again in October in an attempt to discredit me. Back in June they harassed me constantly to get me to take the review down and even reported it to try to get it removed. I was contacted by the admins, so I provided proof of the MULTIPLE price increases and the MULTIPLE loses of data that happened in the matter of just a few months. So the admins re-instated my post.

I was told by the support team that my Minecraft server kept crashing because I wasn't paying for a high enough service, which I'm still don't understand, because my server hasn't crashed on a single FREE Minecraft Server Hosting website I've used. On Sparkedhost, however, my server would go from being perfectly fine (no lag, amazing performance) to suddenly crashing and erasing the last twenty minutes of progress in the world. Paul told me that this was the case because I wasn't paying for a higher service, as I had been recommended. But I don't understand why my server wouldn't just suffer lag - why would it go from functioning PERFECTLY to crashing in an instant and not properly saving? Very disappointing. I am also disappointed by Mr. Tracy's backlash. He has not been very kind, understanding, or even helpful in his responses.I meant in no way to be dishonest in my initial review. My review had very few discrepancies, and the things that you claim I \"lied\" about are subject to interpretation. I am sorry about the way that I presented myself - it comes from a place of frustration, for I still feel that my issue with the server was never properly addressed. Why did my server keep crashing on a 4 GB and 3 GB service with 6 players when we were on a vanilla world in a 600-block diameter world border? I did love using the service very much until I was told by staff that my server was going from 0% lag to 100% crashing because I wasn't paying for higher service.I feel as though my arguments have been misconstrued and my character has been attacked to point Sparkedhost in a better light. This is also severely disappointing - why would you outright attack me and my situation instead of attempting to be amiable and seeking to understand the validity of my grievances? What advantage do I have in blatantly \"lying\" about your service? I am disappointed in your response, Paul :(Edit:1) I misquoted SparkedHost inadvertently. I no longer have access to my account because it was suddenly closed, so I cannot view the ticket I sent and therefore cannot quote SparkedHost at all.2) I never said I asked for a refund. I said that I did not receive one.3) Sounds like ram buffering should be a standard if literally every free service I've used (pre 1.17 and post 1.17) can implement it that easily. Examples of these services include Minehut, FreeMCServer, Aternos, and Scalacube.4) You misquoted me. The server never lagged, it just crashed."

          "Contenu": "I wish to share my experience with this company. I started a Minecraft server on my home computer which was great, I dedicated 8gb of ram to it, but unfortunately the other player on the server was having lag issue due to the amount of distance between him and the server location. We reviewed this hosting service together and after reading the reviews were pleasantly surprised due to the number of highly positive reviews. I wanted something similar to what we currently had, so I opted for the 6gb budget package as it seemed to be the closest to the amount of ram as well as within the budget of $120/year that I set. I also paid for a year upfront. We started on the world by uploading the exact files that we were using on my computer to the server. We experience good gameplay for the first 2 days. On the 3rd day the core chunk files were corrupted. We attempted to load from a backup from my friend's computer (he was managing the server) but after upload it corrupted again and then we could not play on 20w14b snapshot. We contacted customer support through online chat. The individual providing customer support was very impolite and was pushing the \"enterprise\" package heavily. Enterprise is double the price for the same 6gb, which would come to a staggering $205.20 for a years service plus taxes. After getting nowhere with customer support we started a new world as the previous one was corrupt. We then experiences further in-game issues such as lag and plugins not loading properly. The internet that I currently have is a dedicated service line which provides 1.5gb/s download speed (provided by Bell-Aliant in Canada) and 960mb/s upload. I was experience slingshot effects on this server where i would snap back several blocks due to latency. The server location was in Germany, and to put that into perspective, I have played on servers with friends in Australia and not experienced that level of slingshotting. We opted to leave this service due to the terms of service, which you can find on their website, the lack of customer service and the unreasonable amount of money required to play an outdated version of minecraft. We joined some other friends on their server which is only 3gbs of ram and it works 10 times better. I have not had a slingshot effect at all and the service is great. ( I am not going to disclose the name of the new hosting provider in this post).I requested a refund for the unused time as the service provided was not as expected and the lack of customer support was frustrating. I was denied a refund, instead offered a transfer to their enterprise 3gb or an in-store credit to be used on other services even though I have no intention of using their services for anything. Their cancellation policy as you can see from the attached emails states that you MUST cancel within the first 24 hours after purchasing to get any refund. after this time no refund is available. No trials are available either.I spoke with 2 supervisors through email and then received an email from their CEO, which is nice to see. I appreciate that the CEO is willing to reach out to clients when there are issues, but the fact that a refund for unused services is not available for anyone is ridiculous. I will not be recommending this company to anyone due to my personal experiences with them."

          "Contenu": "I purchased rust hosting which I had to say was my first experience with them, and will definitely be my last. I purchased this hosting and to start off I didn\u2019t have access to the server. I contacted support then they sent the ticket to there \u201c(gaming specialist)\u201d Then I finally received access after 9 hours. 2nd: I purchased 6 GBs of ram with my server. I was given 2, after 6 hours of waiting they didn\u2019t give me the correct amount of RAM. So I had to open another ticket asking for the correct amount of ram. Then after I was given the correct amount of ram (1 hour later) 3rd: The server was giving an error while attempting to start the server (With just the files they provided). I once again contacted the \u201cgaming specialist\u201d to ask him why this is happening. At this point I had to delay my servers release date due to all these issues and I already had all the server files but no access to open the server. It has been about 16 hours and the server was still not functional at this point. I then finally 1 hour and 25 minutes later get a reply saying to try it again as he had the server running. I restarted the server to make sure it didn\u2019t happen again since he would be there to fix it. Then the server does the same thing from before and just sits there and doesn\u2019t start like the same issue I was having before. I then tell him it wasn\u2019t working and I at this point want a full refund if possible considering I couldn\u2019t even access the server 20 hours into purchasing the server and they told me they can\u2019t give me a refund and it is \u201cMY FAULT\u201d the server isn\u2019t working. I ask them how it was in my control that the ram wasn\u2019t set correctly, the server wouldn\u2019t launch, and I couldn\u2019t access the panel with correct login info? They come back and tell me they added 5 days to my NON WORKING server. So I don\u2019t understand how it\u2019s my fault but they give me 5 more days? But I really didn\u2019t want the 5 days considering the server wasn\u2019t even working yet, it\u2019s been 20 hours, and I have already had 4 issues. I get told they can\u2019t offer refunds but they will fix the servers. And remember this is with delayed responses (on their end) I responded to them immediately. I took the fact they weren\u2019t going to give me a refund and told them to at least fix the server. While they were \u201cfixing the server\u201d I was trying to redeem the free tebex code link they provided when purchasing the server. When I try to put the code in I get no free tebex plan. So I messaged them and they said there is nothing they can do about it and to contact tebex. I contacted tebex and didn't receive a message from them till the next day. Within that same day they fix the server and I can finally access the server. I put the files in and it is finally working after over 24 hours. I already delayed the server release date by 1 week since I wasn\u2019t 100% done with the server. Then I finally get a response from tebex saying that link doesn\u2019t exist and isn\u2019t a valid code. I give sparked hosting the screenshots and I get told that there is nothing they can do. So then I had to purchase the $14 a month plan without the free month on top of having to wait for the server. I released my server and everything goes smooth for the most part. The other owners I have access to the panel told me that they couldn\u2019t access the panel randomly and had to contact support a few times about that. That got resolved and wasn\u2019t that big of a deal (still adds to all the issues I was having before) then all of a sudden the server starts maxing out on ram. Before I released the server it was around 2-4 ram. So there was about 2 free GB of space. All of a sudden 2 wipes in it want to start maxing out on ram. I clear all the storage files and anything that would be stored as ram, wipe the map. Yet I still am having the same issue with the ram maxing out. I still don\u2019t know if this was an issue with sparkedhost or rust. I then contact support and I get told that I ran out of ram space and I would need to upgrade and I was for sure not going to purchase a upgraded plan when I am having a issue with it adding ram without me changing anything, and the fact that I still didn\u2019t have my tebex for the website. I was going to go to a cheaper and better service. But then on the last day of my hoster. I went to remove the files I had in there so I could save them for the new server and they told me they wiped it considering the server was down, which meant I lost access and all my files. It seems like a lot of people weren\u2019t having the same issues I was having and I wish I could say the same. My discord is Nyzy#0001 if you have any questions. I would put my ID but it shows my IP if you contact me on discord I would be more than happy to give ticket ids(UPDATE): They closed my account, and I no longer have access to my tickets to prove them wrong, WONDER WHY!"

Not only haven't I gotten a solution in 19 hours after they accidentally deleted almost everything, they didn't even reach out to apologize or tell me that they're on it. If you use SparkedHost, please be sure to back up your entire servers LOCALLY, not within their service, every day.Edit: After and due to publishing a review here my issue was noticed. The CEO (Paul Tracy) quickly responded to me in email 1h11m later to apologize and get things in motion.14 hours after I provided what they asked, they asked me to wait 3 hours, after of which they responded asking me to provide server IDs. I assumed they'd do it themselves, seeing as they made the mistake of deleting almost all of our files. So it really shouldn't be up to me, them being underhanded is not my responsibility nor problem. After I told them to do it, it took another 8 hours to restore the files. All in all we were with deleted sub-servers/files and service(uptime) for 43 hours 55 min which was a disaster for us. We were then only offered 1 month of free service (10,32 euros). The files and servers were restored to their original state with one server being rolled back 4 days and have lost some code there. The person responsible was asked to write a formal apology by Paul and communication was done professionally. They also claimed they'd train their new staff to prevent this from happening.But I'm still left dissatisfied."

Then only downside would be that they sometimes forgot about it, (though I could just have sent a message to remind them).However, it is really cheap, and doesn't lack in support for extra ports or custom flags.Overall, it is a great host I would recommend if you want something quite cheap, yet powerful."

It is very ok to buy! If you want a lot of quality (ex. for a network or for a proxy) I wouldn't recommend taking one of their services because they sometimes go down for 3+ hours and SLA is giving you 1 day for example. But your uptime dropped and it has to be recovered in 2 days. So you lost a day for example (That is what happened with my server)"

Like there's only $1 per GB, and I got a server with 10Gb for $10 which is the best I have seen from every server host I have seen. It also has really good support when it comes to the staff team and the support it provides to the customers. Like one of the staff helped me with bedrock cross-play, which doesn't work right now because it's on 1.18.2, I just forgot to ask the staff to put it on 1.18.1, which is not the server host's fault, I just forgot to ask. The only downside is that It's hard to keep a Sparked Host server active, that's why I prefer Minehut when it comes to keeping a server active. But I do have a plan and goal to keep my server active, which might or might not work. But either way, this is got to be the best Minecraft server host I have seen so far. Thank you all Sparked Host for providing this for my community."

I bought a 1GB Enterprise Minecraft server but apparantly, I picked the wrong location. The server was kind of slow to players on the server. I opened a support ticket on Discord in order to change my location but it took a while. Then, after some lot of days, they told me to open a ticket on WHMCS (billing panel). I did so and soon, the location was changed. It took a while but eventually the server location was changed.The server was faster except the fact it took 1/2 of a month to change the location.Servers are pretty fast and good for enterprise. (But location does matter)Overall, the host is pretty good and nice but it does have some flaws. I'm assuming my ticket was least prodigy because I'm pretty sure I was one of the first location change requester for that host. I guess the host will learn to be better at support...I enjoyed the experience and looking forward in using sparked hosting again!"

          "Contenu": "**This post was updated on 7/19/2019 from a previously 5 star review.**To save you some time, here's why I chose them & what they offer:1. Out of ~110 reviews, 90% were good and the ones that weren't good were using budget hosting and it sounded like a lot of it was their own lack of knowledge on stuff (the client side, not host side). 2. They publicly provide their hardware specs for each location. That's always a good sign as very few hosts do that. Hosts that only provide you with the RAM amount you get generally don't have good hardware (hence why they aren't showing it off).3. They offer many US locations.4. They have DDOS Protection.5. They offer 10 MySQL databases per plan.6. They allow buying a dedicated IP.-----------------------------In short: I've been using them for a few months. Great host, but do not make backups of your server within your server files (unless limited). I did make my backups limited, however, the people I moved my server to did not and it caused them wiping all server files & backups. We're now working to make a new map because we lost the old one (except backups that were made a while ago). -1 star because of their recent issues with using the panel. Wiping server files, eh that's on the people I moved my server to (for the most part). But the panel issues recently and uploading files being super slow (with fast internet) is why -1 star.Also I should note that SparkedHost does not make server backups. They say they have a program that does it but it's currently not working and will be fixed soon. They've said it will be fixed \"soon\" for literally months. So I seriously doubt it will ever be fixed, or at least any time soon."

I wanted to make sure that my project was compliant with their Terms before I bought the service, so I sent a message in the livechat. Raul from sales was very patient and clear in explaining everything, and I got the green light that my project didn't violate Sparked Host's terms.Yesterday, I purchased my hosting. They have an annual option, which was great for accounting purposes, and also took 8% off my service. The instant I paid, everything was ready for me. I changed my NS records on my domain registrar to the ones Sparked Host sent me in the confirmation email, and it instantly synced. They also offer a service called Public Pay, where people can help fund your Sparked Host account via PayPal. Everything was way quicker than I imagined, and for $35.22/year I'm beyond shocked, in a positive way.Thank you Sparked Host for lifting off my small business at a reasonable price!"

Extremely affordable even with a yearly plan, which is very convenient for me.The servers themselves have the ability to pull from Git (in my case I use GitHub for version control), so that makes it easy to deploy updates and get them up and running fast.The panel is organized very well and is easy to use, even for a first-time user like me.Overall, I'm very happy with my hosting choice.

The second time was today actually, I was having problems with adding discord application commands, and they helped me install the packages! The one thing I wish they did have was a Shell/Bash terminal area. But otherwise love the company, and keep doing good work!!"

Not only is their customer support excellent, but I love their service and their panel portals are very user-friendly. I am glad I went to their live support chat because I would've hated to leave such a good service but also a wonderful company that cares for customer satisfaction."
