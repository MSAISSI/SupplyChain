The customer service is great and even handled all the migration of my websites and domains.  They were up without an interruption of service.  The cost and value adds to the great service and I am already enjoying the great new relationship."

          "Contenu": "There are not nearly enough 'Stars' to rate MidiaServe LLC!  Only five will not do!  The service, patience, care, follow-up, information, instruction has been phenomenal. A brief overview:I was in a situation where the host I was using was planned to shut down low end PHP sites in early 2022.  Mine was one of these.  My template was outdated and with my limited knowledge in this field I was forced to find another host. A different host was recommended by a friend and I initiated an account. They had a migration team which felt positive that they could do the transfer.  Some of the service I received was indeed good, however some had issues. I was chided more than once that I would need to get a developer involved which I knew I could not afford. I received a different person with nearly every correspondence so there was no consistency. At the end of nearly a 3+ week effort they were not able to complete the process. Ok, so now what?  I went back to my friend who then suggested MediaServe LLC. While initiating an inquiry relaying my tale of woe to Troy Leaver in MediaServe Technical Support I was quite surprised when he offered to first show me that they could get it transferred and running smoothly. I said 'Yes!' The same issue encountered with the previous host which they could not resolve was quickly remedied and now my site is up and safe.What can I can I say? The pressure is off. I thank the LORD Jesus Christ for answering many prayers and leading me here. I am very satisfied with the care and concern Troy had for the work I wanted to preserve on site to help others. He has also initiated a consult with John in Tech Support who is more familiar with my template for options on upgrading. This is in the offing. Thank you!"
