          "Contenu": "I bought a refurbished sat nav from Garmin FactoryOutletStore. It suffered a complet system failure on a trip through the alps. I tried to return it but it cost \u20ac40 and was never delivered, arriving back a while later. In the meantime, I purchased another from the smae company, this time having to pay \u20ac45 to have it sent. I was told this was because it was not being delivered within the UK. When I returned to the UK I returned, as arranged, the first, faulty sat nav, having to pay \u00a39.45 to do so. I received absolutely no refunds on the \u20ac85 and \u00a38.45 in postage I had to pay. The whole process has taken nearly a year in all. This is not a company I would recommend. At one poiint, my emails were not responded to. Now when I call I get what seems to be a US call centre, not the UK customer services I first spoke to when ordering the first sat nav. Given the time frame, it's difficult to give a date for my experience. It's ongoing regarding the refunds."

I did this 2 more times and as of today (Dec 1, 2023 - 4th call) they are still not in stock.  My original item was $31.96 and now it's listed as in stock for $93.99.  Clearly they do not want to honor the original price they sold it to me for.   I found a suitable replacement on their website and said send me these instead.  Reply was: Oh, they're not in stock either even though the website says they are In Stock.  Then she says the website has not been updated.  If that is the case, they're selling inventory they don't have in stock.  If I could give this company a NEGATIVE 10, I WOULD.  What a bunch of CON artists!!!!  Don't order from these \"people\".  To factory outlet: don't bother with a pathetic response, I'll never read it... juist get me my refund!"

For $60, almost as much as the GPS. CSR seemed unable to accept that this was misrepresentation. Of course that's not his job. And oddly enough, when you look at some of the reviews on Trustpilot, the written reviews are pretty bad, but they have 5 stars on them. Seems pretty bad to me. I guess Trustpilot is not to be trusted either."

This amount made my refunds equal my purchase price (I paid return shipping) which was all that I asked for many months prior and wish I had posted sooner.[original post] I am so disappointed that when I returned a (brand new, in the original box, packaged impecably for return) Pet Safe dog containment system (after following the correct proceedure and receiving a RMA-Return Merchandise Authorization number) I received only a partial refund!  I have a copy of the return policy which says I can make returns for a FULL REFUND if all of these proceedures have been followed. I have made phone calls directly to the customer service, sent emails-everything short of filing a claim with my credit card company for fraud-with no satisfaction.  I was told that their policy was to not refund shipping (no shipping was charged at purchase AND I paid return shipping which wasn't cheap and further adds to my losses)!  Another comment from customer service during a phone call was that there is a 15% restocking fee (to open a box and put a perfectly good item on a shelf?). That does not sound like the written 100% refund policy listed online. They withheld $56.17 and it cost me $14.90 return shipping besides!  Unacceptable!  Every time their (daily) emails come to my inbox, the bandage is torn off again-reminding me of how this company treats its customers-I can not bear it any more and I want to warn others not to fall into the trap that I did thinking that I could believe in this company when their stated policy is that you will receive a full refund for proper returns."

I call a 3-way scam alert on this after being jerked around and left with a defective product sold by factory outlet store."

Before you buy, just call the customer service with a question to see for yourself.  Do yourself a favor, save headaches and shop elsewhere.I did get credited for the part after this was posted as well as a call from Factory Outlet Store Rep asking about the one star.  I changed it to 2 stars because I had to spend a lot of my time and days waiting for a part I had to get elsewhere.  Still would not return to this store."

I was given a tracking number and after 3 days went online and checked on it, no information was available. I called and was told it was out of stock and on backorder. I was also told that an email had been sent to me stating it was on backorder on the 15th which was the same day I called. I did find the email but decided to cancel the order as the website should have shown it was out of stock before they accepted my credit card. I was told that the website would be updated to reflect the backorder status. Now 3 weeks later I checked and you still can order it with 2 to 5 days shipping. When I called again I was told it is still on backorder. I understand that FactoryOutletStore cannot control when the supplier will ship the atlas to them but they do have control over what their website shows for shipping time frame. Customers have the right to know when their credit card is charged when they should expect the product they purchased."

I tried to call back and they hung up on me as soon as I started speaking!After a while they finally got back to me via email, and replaced my watch with a functioning one. The customer service was so bad to the point I was convinced it was a scam - certainly didn't fill me with trust. In the end we got there, though."

According to the customer service person at Factoryoutletstore.com the 2 year warranty is not thru them. I must contact Motorola to replace the failed units. Sounds fine to me. So I call Motorola and they say that they cannot replace the failed units without the order information that only Factoryoutletstore has!! I cannot use my order info and I cannot attain the numbers needed from factoryoutletstores. With that being said, the warranty is a lie. Just for giggles I called factoryoutletstore and spoke to a sales person and asked about the two year warranty and I was told that they do indeed have a two year warranty and that they would take care of me if there were to be a problem. Wow!!! Someone has a problem with integrity!!"

We have an older Lowrance unit that came with all the charts we needed.  Their website does not state anything about the charts.  You get Base Charts and have to order mapping charts if you want more details.  Base charts give land location.  We live on a canal and it showed us navigating our boat off land to the water.  Customer service agents were nice and polite and tried to accommodate the inconvenience, but the company itself was not very customer oriented.  Their website is misleading in respect to giving details about products or at least this product.  The product itself is nice and we will get much use out of it when we receive the mapping card. Just a word of caution for the consumer."

          "Contenu": "I have purchased garmin but there are some scratches and the device is very slow. So now i need to return the item. But the return button did not works. So not sure how to retun the item. In the website it says 30 days return but provide process to return it.There is one page which can be used to request return but its asking for order number without characters and i cant add my order number which have characters.Update: The representative from Factory outlet reached out to me same day when i posted my review, so the customer service is good, but waiting for the return label mentioned below. I can update my review after i am getting through the return process.Update 7/17/2023:I got refund for my product but its very lengthy process to follow up with the person who reached out to me after i wrote the review. I am still not updating it to 4 or 5 start as the there are issue with this site regarless customer service tries to resolved your issues.Issues: 1. The return link does not works, there excuse is they have new site which is working, but who keeps two sites and paying for infra to keep it alive. 2. They have reached out to me after adding the review and calling constantly like 4 or 5 times for asking to change the review - not a good practice.3. It took me several mail follow up, disputing the charges to resolve my refund issue but got refund finally after a month of adding this review. 4. Final verdict, dont buy any product unless you are going to keep it. the return process is hassle."

          "Contenu": "EDIT:  1/26/23 Am editing this review because the customer service to remedy the problem is very good.  They refunded me 50% of the original purchase, notified their warehouse to remove these batteries from stock until they could be checked, and provided a two year extended warranty for the four batteries that did work after I expressed concerned about the strength and durability of the batteries that did work.   Changed the 1 star to 3 stars to acknowledge the good customer service but still 3 stars because of the length of time it took to get the original batteries delivered, the faster but still 3-4 days to get the replacements which were duds, and the need to buy other batteries to replace the original mfg batteries which I put back in the phone as an interim measure until I could get new batteries for all the phones.  Original review:  Out of the initial 8 batteries I received, four would not charge.  These are pre-charged batteries and should have started the phones on insertion.  Four kept flashing \"insert battery/charge over 7 hours\".  Even when charged in the phone overnight - no power.  Called and was sent four more replacement batteries.  All four of them also would not charge.  Customer service was excellent about refunding the money but I ordered the first set Jan 9 and it took about 8 days to arrive then I had to wait another 3-4 days for the replacement batteries.  I finally ended up putting in the old original batteries that still worked.  Will not buy these batteries again.  Agent on the phone agreed that the warehouse needs to check these batteries before shipping.  66% fail rate is abysmal."

Second Thought: The listing for the product i was buying has a buy option on the top of the page, then covered details in the middle of the page, and then there was another option to buy at the bottom of the page. This was confusing, as if there were 2 different models to buy or something. 1 single spot at the top or the bottom is sufficient and minimizes confusion.*** correction; my mistake, the part has a product code and a part number also. the product code is listed but i was only familiar with the part number. you are correc that is the oem product code. thanks."

There is also a picture of all the parts that are included. THE PICTURE CONTAINS ITEMS THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED, like the ice fishing mount ($95 extra) and the mounting swivel base is different. I haven't used the unit yet, and it may give me everything I need, but the description and picture are very misleading. Customer Service says they will fix the problem with the listing, but that doesn't help me much. Shame on me for not doing more research before I purchased it."

          "Contenu": "Update 12/10/23A couple of days after leaving a negative review, I received a phone call from a Factory Outlet representative who informed me that they had issued a full refund and that it was not necessary to return the filters I had purchased that were supposed to be for my air purifier but did not work in my equipment. Although the initial experience was bitter, this adjustment shows that they really care about customer service. Thank you Factory Outlet for turning around a bad experience. November 9, 2023I purchased 2 air filters advertised as a Replacement Purifier Filter For GermGuardian FLT5000 Filter C (2-Pack).  I kept them available for when the filters that came with the Germ Guardian needed to be replaced.  When I went to install the Factory Outlet filter, the size was fine, however, the original filters are in a rigid plastic frame.  The Factory Outlet filters are in a cardboard frame with foam around the outside edge.The problem is that the rigid plastic frame is necessary to depress a button in the Germ Guardian to let the device know that there is a filter installed.  The foam on the Factory Outlet filters to not depress the button, so the air purifier does not work.  The filters are totally useless.I called to return them, however, it had been six months since they were purchased because that is how long the filters that came with the Germ Guardian lasted.  Factory Outlet Store would not allow a return because it was past 30 days.  I recognize that it had been a long time, however they originally sold a product that does not work in the intended device.  It is advertised as replacement filters for the GermGuardian FLT5000.  However, they do not work in the intended device, so I consider this to be false advertising.  I am surprised that no one in their Quality Control ever actually tested the filters in the intended device.If you want to throw your money away, purchase filters from Factory Outlet Store.  If you want actual value for your dollars, buy directly from GermGuardian."

I ordered new mounts to use and both new items failed with the suction cup. the factory outlet is replacing my original parts, but the new items have failed after one day. One is used for a tour bus, the other a school bus.  I am sure the factory outlet is not the problem. The original mounts I bought in 2011 and 2014 just failed."

I will update again once the product is received. I placed an order for a Minn Kota Trolling motor and was informed after ordering that the item was on backorder. I wanted to cancel. Customer service offered me a free extended warranty if I didn't cancel the order and that my item would be available within 15 days. I agreed. Then my card was charged again for the new order. Long story short, they are holding up funds on my credit card with pending charges."

He said he was going to ship me out a replacement. During the conversation, I asked him specifically, if he wanted me to ship back the defective order 3 times. His reply was no, you can just throw it away. So I threw it away in my dumpster and an hour later he called me wanted me to ship the defective part back. I wasn't going to go into the dumpster and dig it out and he said that he would still ship out my replacement order. Well the order was never shipped and I was not contacted again. After close to a week, I called to check on my replacement order and Nickie helped me out and got me a refund. She was professional, and polite."
