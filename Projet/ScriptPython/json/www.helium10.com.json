They know very well how to challenge you and rip your money off. Becarful when you work with people like that. When the customer service fail to help you that means they do not care about even the service they offer.I did not realize that they have 3.9 stars on trust pilot and I will never or recommend anyone to use them again. I will post a ripoff report and google review as well after finishing this review.For helium10 team. If you are responding by saying contact us to talk about it.

Despite this 9 days have gone by, with me spending large amounts of money on Amazon ads and the data not coming through to Adtomic. The issue I have with this, is that the only reason I signed up for adtomic was for the auto suggestions. But as it can\u2019t import my ad data from Amazon obviously this feature isn\u2019t working. And obviously helium10 are charging me for the \u201cadtomic\u201d software whilst it doesn\u2019t work. Overall I would recommend to go to alternative software for your Amazon advertising requirements. Although helium10 do respond to issues, they lack the ability to actually sort any issues out.

My partner accidentally  resubscribed and I didn't realise. I didn't use the service at all for the month and I asked for a refund and they denied it. Honestly the shittest customer service. I've been with you guys for over 4 years and given you thousands of dollars and you can't be courteous and refund 1 simple accident.  It was sent to their billing team who sent me a passive aggressive email with screenshots of the policies saying they don't do refunds when I clearly did not use any of the tools for that month. What a joke and a waste of money. Way to take advantage of the little guy."

They spit on those empty promises although I forwarded them the email confirming our special agreement. To me, this is a total lack of integrity and the dishonesty is shocking. Not only did they modified there plans they ask more money for follow-up usage. Currently their support is completely useless and doesn't care much about your business. I recommend strongly to use other tools out there that are far better than Helium10. Greed got a hold of them....it is no longer what it used to be....stay away at all cost!"

Kevin literally advises you in his segments to avoid the hype courses on Facebook and get rich quick lies, that this will be hard work and you need to stick with it and then the other guy comes out in the next segment all hyped up babbling on about how successful you're going to be... OK BUDDY.   TLDR - They gatekeep products all the way to the top tier. Take everything they say in the course with a pinch of salt and do your own work."

I reached out to customer support and requested to pause my subscription until the issue was fixed, but unfortunately, I was still charged for August.The agent handling my case failed to mention that pausing the subscription was something I needed to do on my end, which added to the confusion. When I asked for a refund due to the oversight, I was politely declined, which was disheartening.The communication process also felt slow, as I was instructed to wait until the issue was resolved before the billing team could address the situation. In comparison to other companies, the response time was longer, which made the experience less smooth than I had hoped.While my intention was to pause my subscription temporarily, I ultimately decided to cancel it due to the unfortunate customer support experience.I sincerely hope that Hellium 10 takes this feedback constructively and works on improving their customer support services. With better communication and prompt resolutions, I believe they can provide a more satisfactory experience for their users."

They also offered a swiss army knife of other tools for a reasonable price, so I decided to give it a try. Thought I can save money, and consolidate all my other tools and just use Helium10.The account executive and support team were great. But, the tools just failed to live up to their claims on the website. The PPC tool started automating campaigns (when I didn't even turn it on for that campaign), the profit module failed to import all info (even after 72 hours of connection, which was ample time for them...stated by their CS), PPC info overall was incomplete and unreliable for my use. The keyword tools results gave alot of weird answers and not many relevant answers compared to more mature tools like junglescout. (I was planning on cutting JS if Helium10 performed similarly).The live chat people are responsive, but they are just trouble ticket makers and front-end staff. The development teams and internal teams do nothing to fix the issuesm promptly, leaving the CS people and account reps with nothing to say but sorry, the teams aren't responding for some reason. None of my tickets were resolved before I decided to cancel.Helium10 is not ready for prime time. The dev teams and some tools are not working as advertised. I am not sure why, but it's not worth trying them out until ALL tools are fixed and working. Great potential, but they need to go back to the drawing board, the dev teams seem to be drowning in tickets to just leave my issues hanging with no response or updates. I always heard great things about them, so I wonder if they are just dropping the ball now....Neways, looking for another tool! If they fix everything, I would give them a try again...but looking at other reviews, not sure when that will happen"

Nice, so friendly!Today the same problem occurred again, I missclicked (oh god, those no confirmation buy buttons...) and helium10 staff says that a refund is impossible. It's only possible to cancel the subscription, with NO refund.For now, I don't need that subscription at all, so I lost my money, god thanks it was this lowest tier.Helium10 staff, please tell me why you have such an unfriendly money-back guarantee?Edit 23.08.2022: After posting on their Facebook group, plenty of emails with more than 2 customer supports, posting a negative review here on trust pilot, and writing to them on Instagram they finally proceed with the refund."

I contacted customer service back in February 2023 and cancelled my subscription, or so I thought. I didn\u2019t remember to check my CC in April to make sure no payment was taken until today and found out that I was billed for April and May, I immediately contacted customer service via chat and was told no refunds are given as per their terms. This is just horrible service!  I should not have to pay for something I haven\u2019t used in months. I definitely do not recommend subscribing to Helium 10, do your research as there are better and more cost effective apps out there. Avoid all their hype! when it comes to service you\u2019re on your own.Update: I have decided to change my initial rating from 1* to 3*. Ray @ Helium 10 contacted me and confirmed a refund was initiated for the 2 months which I appreciate very much. Glad to know that they are paying attention to their customers review and are making the effort to make things right. It would be better if these issues were resolved at the first point of contact therefore, saving customers the stress and frustration of having to resort to negative reviews to get a positive outcome. Thank you Ray!"

I genuinely wish I could screenshot the email conversation with the rep \"Kristy L...\" because the incompetence is unreal! It was as if I wasn't being heard at all and zero form of help was provided even when I requested to be contacted by literally anyone else but her.
