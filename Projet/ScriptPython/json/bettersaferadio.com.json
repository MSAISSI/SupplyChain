          "Contenu": "Ordered some gear from the owner at BetterSafeRadio.com. Seemed pleasant at first. I ordered the wrong items and re-orderd new ones. I asked for a return on the first order and shipped it back to him asap. It took him weeks to process my refund after my items were delivered back to him, after constant follow-ups. I said I would dispute with my credit card company if the returned order was not refunded. He then goes on to be probably the single nastiest person I've ever dealt with online (seems like the other 1-star review share the same sentiment). Posting some actual emails with the dude below. Best to avoid and take your business elsewhere.\"Wow, such a good Catholic!Are you that thick? I wasn\u2019t asking you to apologize for giving me business or expecting service, which you clearly got. I was talking about your repeated threats of a chargeback, not appreciating what I was going through, especially this time of year, and acting like an entitled pr*ck, which you obviously are.Well, in the end, you have to sleep without yourself, not me, so have fun with that knowing you lack even a basic level of compassion.\""

He's great as long as you're spending $$ but if you ask a question you're met with insults and profanity. I figured since I spent over $500 with the guy I'm entitled to ask about missing orders (he insists problems with USPS are rare, but it's a common complaint if you read the reviews).  I'm pretty sure he's some kid in mom's basement based on his replies to my concerns/questions. I also know he'll post some snotty untrue response to this (which I won't waste my time reading) but read other bad reviews and a common thread will emerge.Save yourself grief and spend your dollars with a reputable vendor."

It\u2019s easy to make claims and you don\u2019t back them up and get this he even said you shouldn\u2019t put a negative review before you get your refund. That should tell you something right there. This is my first and only review on anything and it has to be a super bad experience. Another thing it\u2019s funny how when someone calls someone out as in adding something to your order without permission and just so happens it only happens once outta thousands of orders , go figure guys, I think anyone doin business with this guy should really understand what may happen to them ."

          "Contenu": "Buyer Beware. I ordered the radio and waited nearly three months. I knew it was backordered and chose to purchase it anyway.  However when the radio finally arrived the charger/cradle was defective and wouldn't charge the radio. I immediately emailed and messaged the store owner. After about 48 hours he replied. I've sent multiple videos and was respectful with this man. I've read other reviews about his  business practice and purposely stayed calm to attempt to get a peaceful resolution. I have proved to him with videos that the charger/cradle is defective. He is suggesting I purchase a new charger/cradle from his store. I paid good money and waited a long time and have a radio that I cant use because I can't charge it. Now he is trying to force me to spend more money because his merchandise was defective. This is terrible customer service and just flat out wrong. I've pleadedd with him to send me a new working charger/cradle. I've sent multiple videos and a bunch of respectful messages explaining the defective charger. I contacted him within an hour of the radio being delivered to my house. There is no reasonable reason for him to refuse sending a new working charger/cradle so I can actually use the radio I paid for and waited three months to receive.------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE 5/18Store owner is telling me via email that if I don't delete/edit this review immediately then he wont exchange the faulty charger/cradle and i will only be able to fully return the entire product subject to his restocking fees if all bags, packaging, etc... is in brand new condition. All I want is to be able to use the radio that I purchased which I can not since I cant charge it with defective charger/cradle. I shouldn't have to pay a penalty restocking fee because the charger/cradle is defective. He can have the defective charger/cradle back. I don't want it. It doesn't work! He isn't disputing the fact that the charger/cradle is defective but isn't offering a solution other then pay a restocking fee. All I want is to be able to charge my brand new device I waited three months to receive. This guy is unreasonable. Why is this so hard for him to stand behind a product that he is selling?------------------------------Another UpdateSo what exactly is my option here again? To pay to return the whole radio including faulty charger and pay a restocking fee? All he has to do is replace the faulty charger. I am more then willing to send back the faulty charger.  Simple reasonable solution yet here we are.------------------------------------------------Update. Not sure anyone really reads these things but for whatever reason this guy has decided to make this whole thing impossible. He says he left a window open for me to get a working charger but its untrue. He is saying I must send the whole radio back and pay a 20 percent restocking fee and a 4 percent return fee. Give me a break. This is not a window of resolution. Not sure what this guys trip is but all I want is a working charger. Fact- the product he sent me was faultyFact- he refuses to send me a working chargerFact- I am willing to send him back the faulty charger but he is making it impossible. Never sent me a \"required\" RMA number to return defective charger, etc... Please read this guys riddle of store policies before making a purchase. Ive never in my life dealt with a company like this. All I want is to be able to use the device I purchased."

          "Contenu": "I ordered a back-ordered item from BSR back in June. I was told that it could take up to 8 weeks for the item to ship. After 9 weeks I inquired about the status and was told at least a couple of weeks. Mark told me that if I couldn't wait that he could cancel the order and refund my funds. I cancelled my order, but Mark promptly slapped me with a 4% charge. Nowhere on my invoice/confirmation was this stated. Mark claims that it is all over the website! I did not see that back in June.Updated Aug 24, 2022, at 17:00Well now I feel I need to add additional warnings! In Mark's response there are a lot of lies and misinformation. Here goes:1) I never asked him rudely, but rather inquire about the status of my order. I also said I would need to cancel if he could not give me an estimate. He couldn't and, to his credit, he offered to cancel the order, only to slap me with his fee!  2) I never claimed he was running a scam, rather that it would be a clever scam!3) Back in June there was nowhere on the order screen about the fees (it was buried in a menu). Furthermore, there was no mention of said fees on the invoice/confirmation.4) He says that I 'threatened' to use a VPN to get to his site. Why would I need to do that? When he bragged about that (besides buying used on eBay) I would never be able to buy the product new (I maybe he has a monopoly), I responded by saying if I really, really wanted the item I could use a proxy (a friend, spouse, sibling, etc.). Very simple and perfectly legit!5) Mark claims that I'm 'entitled'. The insults keep coming low and high. All I'm doing is telling my side of the story and that, hopefully, other potential, customers are careful.I'm sure all is great when the order goes as planned, but not so much when there are hiccups (as other reviews indicate).I hope this helps and that you all are careful.BTW this is the first site I've ever done business with, where you're charged for a back-ordered item!Updated Aug 24, 2022, at 19:30And the lies continue! I feel that I cannot let Mark's lies stand. The community needs to know how Mark deals with unexpected issues. Unhinged is the word that comes to me! He has called me thick skulled and many other names insinuating that my mental capacity is diminished. I would never expect that from a retailer.He claims that he does not have a monopoly on the KG-UV9GX. Here you can see a YouTube clip:YouTuber NOTARUBICON (could not post the link, but it's easy to find on the channel) states that KG-UV9GX is only available at BetterSafeRadio. That sure sounds like a monopoly to me! Mark probably thinks that he has a thick skull as well!Mark claims I've threatened him. I guess that truth and honesty is a threat to him. I consider myself more of a whistleblower as there is no monetary benefits in it for me to reveal Mark's sketchy business practices.Mark also makes insinuations that is not based on anything concrete. He says I regretted that I cancelled my order. Why would I want to wait up to another 10 weeks (based on the numbers he gave me).Yet another update. August 24, 2022 at 23:00The backorder estimate had passed. I was told 4-8 weeks. It is now over 9 weeks! Mark offered me a refund which I accepted, only to be slapped with a fee that I was not aware of (you certainly did not mention it in your email). My bad was that I did not know you would charge my card immediately.I could live with that, but the fee was extremely under handed. Later, Mark admitted that he would have split the fee, but for some reason he said I was not nice enough (even calling me thick skulled)!Mark claims that he does not have a monopoly on the radio. You don't have to have a monopoly to have a monopoly on a single item. I certainly have not found the item anywhere else (as the NotARubicon channel claims). Mark, can you enlighten me to who else offers the radio? Just curious about your definition of a monopoly."

His follow up response was what made me not want to do business with him. I wanted a part 95 certified product for my kid to get started with and followed the advice of a community icon to support a local American business. After all the radio is just a rebranding and part 95 certified version of one that can be had from many other places, and for much cheaper. He seems to pride himself on trying to make his customers feel stupid with thinly veiled remarks. His follow up remarks in both emails and via Paypal dispute (He wants to keep money for an incomplete order) have been increasingly disparaging, despite my respectful tones. Prime example of the Sad HAM mentality.The reason I refused the refunds was that he kept trying to short me on the amount refunded. This guy will say anything."

          "Contenu": "For a GMRS radio, especially for the high price, the UV9GX should be the bee's knees of this type of radio, but it isn't.  It might yet turn out to be, however, it will likely take me weeks and weeks to figure out how to use/program it via trial and error and as many YouTube videos as I can find because the instructions really stink!  They need to publish a thorough user manual that defines each icon and gives step by step instructions for performing the various operations and changing settings.  I likely won't buy another one.  At the price of this radio, there's no excuse for such poorly written user instructions.UPDATE 10/20/2023:  Well, I'm changing my rating from 1-star to 3-stars. Why - because after getting around to going back to the BSR web site to get the info on programming software/cables, I came across a download of the instructions and upon downloading, discovered that my main issue in the initial comment was resolved.  I found that on the UV9GX to help me figure out the menu items and how to select various features, I found another copy of the \"basic\" instructions. there were apparently more instructions that were not included in my order that arrived.  Seems that in my order, BSR left out the 2nd page of the instructions and that page that had most of the information I needed.  BSR said in their reply to my initial review, \"The quick-start manual that I wrote goes over most of the basics ......\".  Yes, it does, IF the customer gets both sheets of the instructions, however, as they admit, even with both sheets, it includes only \"most of the basics\" and I maintain that at the price point I had expected a better user manual.  Granted, not BSR's fault that I had this expectation. It was derived solely from seeing user manuals from other $150-$200 radio manufacturers.  In a personal email, BSR informed me that, \"While I do plan on producing some tutorial content when I have time (this is a one-man operation), to this point, I\u2019ve chosen to spend my time on innovating and bringing these radios to market for a price that people like you can afford, and was hoping that over time, owners and affiliates would put out some useful tutorials.\"  Regarding creating a better user manual, he also said, \"Actually, it\u2019s a skill in itself and very time-consuming to produce a cogent user manual. I welcome you to create a better one and keep the cost down to almost nothing so that the radio doesn\u2019t cost $300 like the Japanese brands you spoke of. (I cited Yaesu and Icom user manuals as examples of good user manuals)\" As a one-man operation BSR has made a business decision to only provide basic instructions and that's certainly his call to make."

The graphed data predicted that I would get my radio in about a half year, and it proved to be true.

Considering these had to be programmed, burned-in, and tested, I think that is a fair amount of time.  The packaging was suitable to protect them, and the batteries were charged to about 80% or so.  Ready to go right out of the box.The manual is two printed pages, front and back, and adequate to get going.If anything could be improved, I would encourage a more robust manual, and maybe a quick example or two: Tuning in a NOAA weather station; tuning in an Aircraft band (using one of the regional ARTCC freqs). Setting up to scan a specific bank.Mostly for novice \"get started\" type stuff."

However, it was more a case of working with the UV9GX uncovered a few things that were undiscovered with the Mate, but still applied to both. The UV9GX along with the new Slim Duck is a great combination, and certainly recommend it. The Tri-Band antenna on the Mate was only a marginal improvement over stock, but still like it. The package was delivered on time, as promised. Despite the mild disappointment with the Tri-Band antenna, my experience gets 5 stars.+"

Getting a new Wouxun KG-UV9G PRO GMRS Two-Way Radio & SHTF Scanner that came programmed was a God send! I received my Wouxin in a reasonable time and at a great price. I needed that head start of the programming being already set up. I\u2019ve already ordered a few more accessories, and I hope to order a second Wouxin soon for my girlfriend. No communications solution is perfect, but this gives me peace of mind knowing I have more than one option."

All and all the customer service is Outstanding and I am the proud owner of a Wouxun KG-UV9GX GMRS Radio. Great Products with excellent support and extreme knowledge of product.

Very helpful very knowledgeable I have never quite dealt with an individual that was so steadfast and taken care of their customers as I have found in mark.
