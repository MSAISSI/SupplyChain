          "Contenu": "So... I bought a (new) Targus notebook power charger from Target. After the first month it started to show some issues which stopped me from using the notebook while charging. I called Targus and they delayed replies and kept dragging the \"do not return, call us\"-BS. So, long story short, the contact with Targus took so long that Target's return policy expired. After that, the customer service said that my notebook was the problem and they couldn't do anything about it. So, when I ask for warranty, they refused to enforced it. By the way, the exchange emails took two whole months for them to realized that problem. VERY DISAPOINTING! And they even tried to give me a coupon with some % off to try to make up for it. Even when I said that if they didn't honor my first purchase, why would I ever buy anything from Targus again?? Targus lost a customer!"

If my claim was not genuine, I would not have gone back and forth with the team to request for a solution. Really disappointed and with the quality and value of the bag, I thought they could help."

The sewing does not look and stand straight at all. I went ahead and tried returning, and as they don't provide free returns, I'd be charged $47 if I wanted to return, so I'm stuck with this garbage thanks to Targus's fair return policy."

Ship the package. Wait until they determine if this issue is \"covered.\"If it is, they will send a new product. With other similar items, the manufacturer has always sent a new one immediately (since it was a defect and there is no determinination needed) and then wait for me to send the defective product back.  Sometimes they state they will charge for a new item if the original is not returned, which is fine.   No options with this company.  Simply, \"It's your problem, now you need to wait another 7-10 days before getting your item.\""

          "Titre": "1 star - item still missing 2 months later",
          "Contenu": "... and customer support are not responding... I rate them 1 star for customer service, the paid but missing item, and my wasted time. I will explain below. I ordered 2 items at the end of January, just over 2 months ago, a backpack and a roller suitcase. The items were paid for immediately, and they were supposed to be delivered by courier, which is fast way to deliver, meaning within a couple of days or so. They were sent as 2 separate orders for some reason. Item 1 arrived on time within days, item 2 was stuck in the courier depo (using their online tracking). I contacted Targus, red flag number one, they told me to wait, when it was clear the item was blocked/lost in the courier. Several days later, I contacted them again, they asked me to wait again. After about a month (?!) I contacted them again, and I said this is clearly stuck and it's not being delivered, so I asked for a refund or a replacement. They agreed to a replacement, but they made a mistake and send me a backpack again, which is clearly not the right item as that was already delivered, the missing item was the roller. I raised this with them immediately (even before I received it as I could see from the emails that this was the wrong replacement) and asked them for the correct replacement. A few days later, and nothing happened, I called them again and they told me they escalated to their support team but I had no contact from them. I had to chase them again a few days/weeks later, and after a while, they stopped picking up their phone on my calls, and this happened on several repeated attempts. Funny enough, as soon as I called from a different phone number, the support phone was picked up immediately, this leads me to believe they have black-listed my number now because I am following up with my complaint. So when I managed to get through to their support (from my different phone number), they said they are going to \"escalate\" my case (again)... of course nothing happened after than. I emailed them giving them one week to sort this out either by a replacement or a refund, or else I will start the chargeback process. I had no reply more than 1 week later, so now taking this with my bank for a charge back. Be warned if you are ordering from this company, you might not get the item you promptly paid for more than 2 months later, and you might have to deal with shady blocking number practices and waste a lot of your time chasing their support and dealing with the charge back procedure. Better choose a reputable supplier for your items."

          "Titre": "Targus Chill Mat AWE81EU Simple design. Unsustainable unrepairable product. Awful customer service. Ecologically unsound company.",
          "Contenu": "Targus Chill Mat AWE81EU  is one of many handy dandy little platforms designed to run  off USB power and keep your laptop cooler than it usually runs. Like all such It's a plastic board with a couple of standard cooling fans usually found inside computer cases or strapped onto video cards bolted to the underside of the resting surface. Most come with at least one USB port to make up for the one used to power the mat. This one has 4 and unusually they are robust and fast. Plus point. It's a good hub. The whole kit is not cheap for what it is. They generally retail between \u00a345-60 depending on who you shop with. There's a warranty of a sort that lasts for a year. After that you're on your own. Targus don't repair out of warranty or sell spare partsIt's a spectacular example of \"disposable tech\" designed for a limited lifespan and priced to allow for grudging replacement.Which is an environmentally unsound waste of money, especially when the most common failure is an easy fix. Or should be.The bit that WILL go wrong is the fan assembly. The fans are regular 8010 brushless case fans. Fast, quiet, efficient movers of air. But they are known to fail after prolonged use. It's what happens when you run a small motor constantly, which is why in computer cases and on video cards where they are most often used they are easy accessible and replaceable. Which is what you want to do when they start to fail. The bearings wear and not only does that stop them shifting air and heat, they sound like your laptop is sitting on an industrial vacuum cleaner. These fans are cheap. From everyone's favourite online auctioneer they can be had for as little as \u00a33 each. So under a tenner to fix over fifty quid to replace. Tough choice.The problem is, on this kit, you can't get to the bloody fans.You can see the screws holding them in place but the design of the sealed plastic supports makes free access impossible unless your hands are the size of a five year old child's. Another common swizz of tech companies is to make products that cannot be repaired. You MUST replace them. And all that plastic goes off to landfill. Forget recycling. 90% of all that's collected ends up dumped or exported to a third world country to add to their plastic mountains. This could easily be avoided in the Chill Mat AWE81EU  design by holding the supports in place with a simple nut and blot assembly  and allowing the hinge to open beyond it's restricted 30\u00b0 angle to give us access to the fan assembly. Not doing this is about making any attempt to open the unit up a destructive one.There are fairly new laws in EU & UK called \"Right To Repair\" that compel companies to reasonably provide parts and advice to fix malfunctions. Swapping out a couple of plug in fans that require unfastening a dozen screws falls squarely into that category. If you can put a plug into a wall socket and know how a screwdriver works you can do this repair.So I contacted Targus for parts and to ask how to open the case without destroying it to effect this repair. What I was confronted with was a cut and paste nightmare of obstructionism that was designed to be as unhelpful as possible. A multi email exchange of them willfully ignoring and evading these simple requests while presenting me with a useless warranty claim form [\"Just out of warranty. Sorree\"] demanding the level of personal information usually extracted in a dark concrete room with extreme prejudice.I eventually figured it out myself accessing components with cranked precision tools and applying a great deal of patience. Most people will simply scrap the plastic brick and buy another. Save the planet my perfect peach of a bottom.Targus clearly don't believe laws apply to them and they don't give a hoot about their company's \"green credentials\". Their designs are entirely in the realm of disposable tech. They want you buying an endless supply of unsustainable plastic toot on a regular basis. That's their business model. Their staff are cut and paste polite but incapable of actual discussion and deliberately of no help whatsoever if you stray in any way from their business model,Because I'm a contrary type and somewhat resourceful I'll repair the kit for as long as it's practically sustainable to do so. What I won't do is buy another new Targus product.From now on any similar kit will be sourced from everyone BUT Targus.These companies will never change unless we force them to change by giving our business to those with a more globally responsible customer friendly approach. I suggest more of us do just that."

I paid $15 for shipping +5 dollars for a box from UPS to ship it in and they replaced the briefcase. Now, two years later, the same thing happened to the handle. I told Targus that I believed that they should pay for 2 way shipping as this appeared to be a regular problem due to poor quality with their product. The customer service agent agreed to discuss my request with her manager. I received an email that I had to again pay for shipping which was their policy.  I agree with a previous reviewer that Targus product quality  has gone downhill. Buyer beware, you may be spending a lot on postage for regular repairs of your Targus product!  Targus should take lessons from Lululemon on good customer service!"

The threading was starting to unravel. The design was strange. The pics looked like the front part was a pocket with a zipper but it's just a flap! Def. wasn't  worth $100. (After I received it, I found the same bag on overstock for $50) I had to pay $25 to return it only to have them send it back to me telling me it was used. I told them that when I called them to get a return label (Don't be fooled, the return label is just the address-again, i had to pay the shipping costs myself). If by used they mean I put things in it and lifted it-sure. But I never took it out of the house or \"used it\" properly like a bookbag should be because I hated it! It wasn't dirty or anything. I just didn't have the original plastic it came in because my daughter had excitedly opened the box to get her bag and thrown the plastic away. I didn't notice initially because I didn't NEED a Targus, I just WANTED one. Targus doesn't stand behind their products. And I no longer stand behind them."

This is how you close the backpack, so having a broken drawstring basically renders this bag useless. I contacted targus as I have not even had this bag for 2 whole months. I HAVE TO PAY TO SHIP THE BAG BACK TO THEM TO REPLACE IT. I ALSO HAVE TO SHIP IT BEFORE I RECEIVE A REPLACEMENT SO I HAVE NO WORK BAG FOR SEVERAL WEEKS BEFORE THEY SHIP ME A NEW ONE! THIS IS TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE TARGUS. I SHOULDVE RESEARCHED IT BEFORE I PURCHASED FROM THIS BAD COMPANY!!!! BIG REGRET! This bag has great features! Everything you want--a separate laptop compartment, secret compartment in the back for your phone or wallet so it doesn\u2019t get stole out of the front pocket on the subway, a few interior pockets but not TOO many and the luggage strap. It\u2019s great for daily commute and work travel and looks professional. The negatives are the orange color interior lining that I do not care for, the drawstring rope material is starting to twist a little bit after daily use for a few months, and the shoulder straps could be slightly wider for a more comfortable fit -- maybe 1/2\u201d wider. For the price point of the bag, I can overlook the negatives, they are pretty minor. The quality of materials is high and the bag overall is stylish and performs well."

The reason for the low rating is that the connecting strap that is used to pull together the main L & R larger straps, pulled completely away from the base where it slides for adjustment. It's impossible to put it back and is impossible to repair, and essentially nonfunctional. My question is, how is it that for decades and decades on other brands of backpacks that this same feature has never failed yet on the first use with your brand this feature has been designed to malfunction? I'll tell you how... it's based on the economics of decay. For decades the American Economy was built on producing quality goods and services but has now changed to a society that draws its identity from consuming crapified goods and services where everything has worthless warranties, products are designed to fail, and products are designed to be impossible to repair, and by using the lowest-quality, lowest-cost components, manufacturers guarantee that the entire product will fail once the lowest-quality component fails. You cannot expect to get repeat customers or stirling recommendations and reviews when as a corporation you are committed to crapified goods. When the $1 component fails the entire product becomes unusable. So we now have another poorly made product for the landfill. Ugh!"

On the new iPad Air, the Touch ID is done on the power button itself at the top of the iPad. On the case, there is a huge plastic bumper on the corner that makes it nearly impossible to use the Touch ID function while the iPad is in the case. Fortunately, I\u2019m pretty handy with an exacto knife and took the plastic bumper off on the corner in question, but I shouldn\u2019t have needed to.Given that my case purchase was advertised to be compatible with the iPad Air 4, I\u2019m slightly disappointed in this product. It\u2019s a great case and it\u2019s done its job so far, but I\u2019d worry it might fail if I dropped it on the corner in question. For 50 bucks a pop you\u2019d think they would think about these things before manufacturing."

This holder is for my 4th gen iPad Air. As usual, it was a bit of a struggle to put the device in place, but the snug fit is good and protective. It did take me a while to realize the design change that removed the disc that used to turn. Now there\u2019s just an open circle, through which the Apple logo shows. A note about that on the package would have been helpful. Great product!"
