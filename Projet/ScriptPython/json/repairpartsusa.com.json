When I realized the ribbon cable was broken, I immediately submitted an exchange request. I received a response next day requesting photos of the screen. After submitting the photos of the screen, I heard no response. I submitted multiple emails and called their \"Customer service\" number dozens and I mean dozens of times.. No answer, no call back after voicemail.A week later, I receive an email telling me I broke the ribbon cable and that's not covered under warranty. These guys are trash."

Connectors have been inspected under a microscope and show no damage. Parts are also not Apple genuine and will show alert message until an OEM screen can be installed. Battery appears to hold a decent charge after a week of use. Battery also shows an alert message until an OEM battery can be installed."

However, recently I purchased an iPhone 13 screen for a personal replacement and the quality was very subpar. Moreover, when I attempted to return the screen they told me that the screen I sent back was not one of their screens due to it missing their manufacturing stamp. I emailed back and forth for several days trying to troubleshoot and eventually, they simply stopped replying. After spending $80+ on a screen and the $10 cost of return I am very frustrated to be holding the bill due to their inventory management issues. I am quite certain the screen I sent back was the one they sent me, I have no other iPhone 13 screens anywhere except the OEM one in my phone."

It wasn't dropped or damaged in anyway, it just went completely dark.  The company initially said that they would replace it, however, while removing the screen, the plastic support plate separated from the glass, causing small spider cracks in the glass.  Again, this was secondary, as I was just removing the faulty to return it.  The ribbon cable was still intact, which could be used for testing to prove that it was a bad screen.  However, the company said that they would no longer warranty the screen because of the damage (done after the screen was already bad).  There are many other companies that offer the same product for much less and are way more reasonable to deal with!"

          "Contenu": "Let me start by saying shipping was fast ordered Friday received via USPS the following Monday. I ordered the premium hard oled screen kit for iPhone 11 pro max with premium tool kit, this also comes with the the display seal, Along with a back glass and new pentalobe screws. Now this is where my issue is, when i opened the package the tool kit was not there, understandable mistakes can be made, but it is the single upgrade they offer and I cant understand how it can be overlooked. Unlike the shipping you can expect 3-4 days for a customer service response. Do not waste your time calling, rings for 15secs and is sent to an automated voicemail. With no luck and in dire need of my phone i had to over night tools because i do not have anywhere locally that stocks them. After installing the screen, the display seal is trash would not come off the plastic, it works fine but touching the edges require more force and it may just be me but when typing it will almost always press an extra key or double tap space and add . Not sure how it will fair but if you are debating between this site and iFixit i would recommend to go ahead and spend the extra money with iFixit, I have always purchased my parts there and never once had an issue. I had there premium tool kit for years until and cant find it now. the back glass looks great and the screws are screws.Just an honest review of my experience, but take your chances\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"

I needed the item quick and paid extra for it quick and had I known I would have shopped elsewhere.

I emailed the company to give them a chance to make it right and was asked to send a photo showing the product, which I did.  They then asked if I could send it back on my dollar and they would refund me, knowing full well from our previous correspondence it was already installed.  HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO SEND IT BACK UNTARNISHED NOW THAT I HAD IT INSTALLED?Terrible customer service in the way this was handled.  I will not purchase from them in the future and I certainly will not consider them as a wholesale supplier!"

However I did manage to receive a new email asking me to rate your services. This is terrible on customer service and it made me look bad as an iPhone repairman. I ended up losing $200 to pay a company who have extra iPhone screens on site ready to use to fix the phone. I\u2019m not asking for my $200 back that\u2019s just the price of business, but I am demanding the money that I spent on both the screen and the camera part back. If I get these things back the review will be better but if not then I will make sure that I tell anybody I know about the bogus business that is repair parts USA."

So parts are definitely used and not up to specs. so decent to get you by but don't expect to get your phone back to the way it used to be.  They can do better but just like most companies they don't care about quality just the money.  Id recommend getting brand new parts from iFixit."

          "Contenu": "Received my tempered glass screen protector for my Galaxy S10+ yesterday after 5pm. It arrived relatively fast, hence the 2 star rating. I cleansed my screen, followed the steps, and applied the screen protector. At first, it was wonderful. Full coverage, the whole nine yards. Then just now, it has up and fallen right off of my cellphone. The ONLY adhesive on this screen protector is right around the edges and around the rim of the hole for the fingerprint scanner. The remainder of the screen protector is bare, therefore not adhering to the cell phone. On top of that, the protector itself does not sit snug against the phones screen whatsoever, making connection from your fingertips to the screen nearly impossible. Long story short, it was too good to be true for the super low price, I should have known better. Lesson learned."

Their return policy really needs to be  reconsidered.  On top of all this the fact that they couldn\u2019t be bothered, (FOR TEN DAYS) to confirm that they had received the broken screen after I paid to have it shipped back to them, emailed them multiple times, and nearly bought a new one from another company, really irritated me,  So to make a long story short I am fine with the products of this place but not the customer service. Can\u2019t say I would recommend, but if they had something I couldn\u2019t find elsewhere I would buy from them again, if I had to."

          "Contenu": "I wish their was a way to give a 2.7 as a rating but I cannot. First of all, I would like to thanks the people at RepairPartsUSA for adding a free tool kit after I forgot to add it to my order. Secondly, the shipping took longer than stated but I understand why it took longer than usual due to the holidays + their wholesale shipping process. I'm not mad at that. I am upset about the quality of the screen I ordered. Not only is the screen a tad bit thicker than the original apple screen but its also super glitchy. Without me touching it the screen will just move around and its very annoying. I want to go through the refund process but i do not know where to start. Please help resolve this issue."

I had to ask if I was going to get a refund first which they then said, the part will be shipped once they get some shipped to them. I have not received any update on the part being shipped or getting a replacement or refund for the defective screen. Other than that, everything else was great."

I applied little bit of strength making sure the screen was sit tightly into the phone but unfortunately the screen got cracked. I did the same to my other iPhone 7 to see if it would crack and it was rock solid. Therefore, I was not impressed with the quality of the screen. Called and texted the company to discuss this but no phone call and only short, distant text reply saying that it happens all the time. So no more business with this company for me."

You can\u2019t tell unless you look at an angle or are scrolling on the phone when powered on. The touchscreen doesn\u2019t work 100% of them time, I have to touch it multiple times for it to register. Usually right where the back button is on almost everything for the iPhone. No where on the repairpartsusa.com webpage for iPhone 12 Pro Max replacement lcd screen did it state that after installing this screen the iPhone would display a message saying the iPhone screen is either not genuine or not completely installed. This message you can not remove (unless taking parts from old screen and replacing them, but what\u2019s the point this is supposed to be plug and play) The company itself is great which is why it gets 4 stars from me. Out of thousands of products sold there is bound to be a bad one or two. So nothing taken from that. I have however marked a star off for not being transparent. Any Company should list any issues or incompatibilities for a product they are selling as a replacement. I will be starting a return on the screen, depending how that goes may affect the score I have given today."

I didn't realize I needed them and assumed that because it came with a tool kit that everything I would need is included. Would love to see you include them in your kits in the future.[EDIT: MY BAD!!! The glue strips were inside of the box/bag with the battery!!! I reached out to customer service and they let me know this. I've changed my review to 5 stars. Thanks for the help!!!]Otherwise, A+ experience. Shipping was fast and the price was excellent!I would also love to see you offer repair instructions or how to videos (even if it's a link to someone else's video) in the order email. It would be a nice customer service touch!"

Quality of part received from Repair Parts USA was \"superior\" having purchased a manufacturers \"same part number\" part from another vendor a week prior to this purchase that failed to meet any claim that vendor provided. That battery was fully discharged upon delivery and was very warm while charging, took over 19 hours to fully charge, and was 70% discharged overnight without use, most notable, the battery was oversized by 1/8 inch not allowing proper seal of my phone cover, it's label had minimal data and stated made in China. The Repair Parts USA battery was exactly as stated-a new fully functional battery that was 67% charged upon delivery, and fully charged in 4 hours maybe less, I used it after charging, the next day-it shows a 92% charge after sitting non-tethered over night.  I am also confident in the battery labeling, it is the same as my Samsung OEM battery made in Japan, and yes it says \"made in Japan\".  I have high confidence in Repair Parts USA and I highly recommend."
