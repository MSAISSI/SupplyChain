So I was able to find a 2020 iMac 27\" that was an Apple fatory refurbished (NEW) unit that they stated \"it would be opened to install my requested upgrades only\". But after recieving my new iMac they seemed to help them selfs to the keyboard and mouse that Apple includes in their refurbished iMacs.  After contacting OWC about this they did not care at all, only offering to ship me a replacement if I ordered a new keyboard and mouse from thier web-site. So they wanted me to pay them for what the stole from me!  Very Bad Service and I would not recommend OWC due to thier dishonorty!"

          "Titre": "Not a good experience",
          "Contenu": "If you use this LCD adhesive kit, wish you never have to open your iMac again. Apple's adhesive strips can be sliced in the middle quite easily with the \"pizza cutter\" sold by OWC. No so these strips nor the long ones that come (or used to come) with the HD/SSD upgrade kits. The material is just too thin and dense, I even had difficulty cutting the long ones width-wise with a utility knife, after breaking both the wheel and the other end of the pizza cutter and cracking my screen.Also, being generic little 4-inch strips, you can't cover the corners, and you have to be careful to identify the microphone holes in advance to avoid covering them.###Update after MacSales' reply.First of all, my review has been censored and doesn't appear on the product's page. Shame on you.Then, a search for glue, adhesive, strips, or directly in the Tools & Toolkits section doesn't show any long strips other than those coming with another item, on the Canadian site (yes on the American site).Third, I hold you totally responsible for the fact my microphone wasn't working after installing my SSD last May. Both strips for the iMac 27\" 2019 have the same length at the bottom, but the microphone holes are off-center and the strip covered them. I only discovered this fact after finding a comment about it on the Internet. At that point I had tested that the microphone was working after opening the iMac, but not after putting the new strips, so I thought something was wrong with the connector, and trying to repeatedly fix the cable in it more damage ensued and now the microphone is definitely not working and I had to buy an external one. I hate you.And finally, as I said originally, the material used for the long strips is not of Apple's quality. When I tried to cut it with the wheel, all it did was either unglue it totally from one side (OK, I guess, but not very reassuring) or push it further inside and put the display in danger, as I painfully discovered when the screen cracked.###Update after MacSales' 2nd reply.I did watch the video when I installed the SSD in May, that one:installvideos/imac_27in5k_14late_hdd/iMac19-1/At 7:53 the guy installs the bottom strips, but there is no mention of the microphone holes. Worse, as I already said, the strips are not suitable to avoid covering the holes.The computer in the video is not a 2019 model, as the video connector is not located at the same place, and I don't see the microphone connector and cable on the motherboard board (at 8:50). Maybe the microphone is near the camera.You're not even acknowledging that the product is defective and that heretofore you'll offer a corrected version (or one really suitable for the 2019). I was perfectly able to handle the complexity of the original operation, and everything would have been fine were it not for the inappropriate product (size- and material-wise).Of course I will not have the computer repaired nor ever opened again (except to get the SSD when I scrap it in a few years), the small strips are probably as unremovable as the long ones, if not more.Please do not reply. Conversation over."

But the MacBook Pro does not work on the first day of arrival and it is Dead on Arrival. I am very upset and think that I should have bought the same from somewhere else. I sent it back to them and my order was made on Nov 21, 2023. As of today, it's 17 days and I don't have any new computer to work on. I thought of buying more Macs from them. It entirely depends on how OWC macsales handles this. Will update you later on how it goes. For me quality of the product matters, I don't expect Dead On Arrival.Dec 11, 2023:-OWC :- Regarding the Eclipse plan, that program is set where as the start date for the warranty window begins on the original invoice date. Regrettably, this date is not changeable in the systemMe :- So even though OWC sent the product the Dead On Arrival, they will not accept their mistake.OWC Return Policy:-For return requests within 14 days from the original invoice date (ship date of the order):A small $25 fee will be applied.Or a 15% fee will be applied to:New or refurbished factory-sealed Mac that has been opened / unsealed.If your return is received after your return deadline but within 24 days of you original invoice.For return requests within 15-30 days from the original invoice date (ship date of the order):A 15% fee will be applied.Or a 25% fee (up to rejection of the return) will be applied to:New or refurbished factory-sealed Mac that has been opened / unsealed.Returns received damaged, incomplete, missing contents or missing original OWC / retail box.If your return is received after your return deadline. OWC (12/11/2023, 3:14:25 PM): this is for Macs OWC (12/11/2023, 3:14:51 PM): this is for the other items OWC (12/11/2023, 3:14:52 PM): Orders cancelled after processing (order has been placed, invoiced and/or shipped) AND unopened items are subject to a 5% restocking fee.

And NO improvement over 20 years! Tech help just tries to stall returns, they know the products are defective and have no solutions. If we didn't have Macs and could order from anyone else, we would, but we have a contract at the school and have no choice. So if you do have a choice, make a smart one and avoid this company and save yourself a lot of headaches, time and probably a lot of money. Seriously, only HALF their products are functional, the rest are non-functioning."

After months of considering and advice - OWC seem to be the best (used them many times before) - Primary purchase is this device - checked the online store and confirm 2 in stock - pay \u00a34,000 for it including expedited FedEx courier . . payment taken and receipt . . Then nothing . . Four days later I use the online chat help - they\u2019ll follow up .  Nothing ?! . . Later I call support on the phone . They\u2019ll follow it up . . Nothing ?   Day Six today . . In this time, four other major suppliers of equipment from four other companies  have completed and delivered on the orders I made .  (Huge monitors, audio interfaces, apple gear etc ) after my OWC order was placed !?  Come on Mac-Sales !? This is appalling customer service ? How can you not know or not be bothered to follow up on my order !?"

          "Contenu": "The ordering process was spectacular. I really thought they did a great job. The product is not the greatest. It says it is supposed to be silent. And it's true there is no fan noise. But there is lots of clicking enough to disturb an audio even though this is positioned probably more than 3 feet from my microphone. Also the cables that connects it to the computer and also to power are far too short.Edit - Response to Other World Computing Response.Well it would have been better had you listed this on your site... especially if you knew this and could explain it here.Also the cables are painfully short, Both the cable to connect it to the computer and the power cable.Edit 2 - 2nd Response to Other World Computings Response to My Response. Again, the problem that I'm having here is that this is not really disclosed. Not clearly anyway. You absolutely understood that this drive is not completely silent. This could have been disclosed on your website. But you chose to hide that fact. You keep saying in your responses that the larger the hard drive the more the noise. But that is not set on your website. I challenge you to show that to me.And why should I have to buy longer cables when I'm already paying you for the drive in which they're included. These are ridiculously short being no more than maybe 2 feet long or so.Please stop making excuses. Put what you need to put on your website so that we could avoid this kind of thing in the future. Stop trying to respond here saying that there is an issue that you know about but you simply didn't inform me on your website.And you might also give a warning that you are choosing to include very short cables that likely will not be long enough for the majority of people and we may want to buy longer ones. Where upon I likely would not have made the purchase. That's kind of like saying, we will supply you with the car for X price. But a motor that actually works will cost more.Come on guys, you are better than this. I have bought from you for years and years. I really did enjoy the purchase experience. The rep was beyond fantastic. What a letdown when the unit actually arrived. You could have prepared me for this. You chose not to.Edit 3 - redacted for length.Edit 4 to Other World ComputingPerfect. If you can't take responsibility, then stop responding. Very good. But just to show you how nonsensical your response actually is\u2026 You do say on your website for this drive, that it is extremely quiet. So if you have room to say that, you could just add a couple of words to the effect that this drive while quiet does have some clicking sounds like all hard discs that spin have. Otherwise it is quieter than most. You could certainly say that. You do say that it's quiet. So rather than argue with me here and look like a fool, why not take responsibility. If you really care about this issue, I would like to talk with you. Provide me with a way to reach you."

It initially shows 8GB and you can format the drive, but it only makes it a 960GB drive?? After you use their proprietary formatter, you can reformat the drive with Mac Disk Utility, but still only 960GB??

My biggest concern (apart from the fact that I did not receive security tape and that the tape I did receive would only peel off the back of the paper 25% of the time) is that the box doesn't consider that you can't remove the cable from the thunderbolt display monitor, which means any pressure on that area of the box could damage the cord. It would be one thing if it was made clear that the foam wouldn't fit perfectly and that the cord wouldn't be protected, but considering I wasn't aware of this I'm really disappointed."

The answer was absolutely not.I said that perhaps someone could suggest additional software be added to their system so that this ( which has happened various times in the past ) would not happen again. The customer service person couldn't adequately address this.So I decided to Inmail the vp of direct customer sales and the CEO of OWC Larry O'Connor via LinkedIn to make this prudent suggestion."

          "Titre": "Great idea, but...",
          "Contenu": "Great idea, but it needs some work.  How do you attach them? Seems pretty straightforward but that's where the problems begin.  I have an OWC Thunderbolt 4 hub purchased earlier this year, along with OWC Thunderbolt 4 cables.  I had to velcro down the wires to keep them connected.  I'm not faulting the hub or the cables, that's just the way they are. The cables, being only 0.3m long need to be laid out straight coming from the hub. If you curve them,  the will have a little bit of \"spring\" to them, and if the hub gets bumped, you could loose your connection.   The velcro worked, sort of.  I thought the Clingon sounded great so I bought 5.  Now, to attach them, do you peel the backing off, center it as best you can and press?  There's no turning back at that point.  Either it's centered or not.  The adhesive is like a very thin auto body trim tape, so it's super sticky.  Next I tried to push the Thunderbolt 4 cable through the Clingon attached to the hub.  It's a very tight fit. There's very little tolerance for a misaligned Clingon to accept a Thunderbolt 4 cable, and to allow it to make a good connection.  I ended up removing the Clingon, removing the adhesive and just using the locking pin to keep it in place.  Not ideal, but still, since the cable is such a tight fit in the Clingon, it still prevents a lot of wobble with just the locking pin attached.Now my story doesn't end there, that was just the first cable.  Next I tried to slip the Clingon over the cable before attaching it to the Thunderbolt 4 hub.  With this method, you have a choice.  Peel the adhesive cover after you insert the cable or before.  I chose before, in the end, it didn't matter because either way, when the connector body exits through the Clingon, it only takes a slight misalignment of the sticky tape to cause the cable to push against a tiny bit of the tape and attach itself to your very expensive (but worth the price) cable.  Without realizing this you may blindly think you finally have a handle on this installation thing. But you may have just contaminated your very expensive (but also worth it) hub with auto body tape.   In the end, I stripped the adhesive off the Clingons and only used the locking pin.  Still better than the velcro!"

I had to threaten \"one star\" reviews on google and Trust Pilot inorder to receive the customer service email address.Offered replacement. Then when checked on availability, then told that replacement is not available. Offered discount. Then when asked how much, was offered USD 100. On the web-site, the delta between Used Good vs. Used Very Good is USD 200+. So OWC still making a profit on a product issue. Offered return and refund. Shipped as two boxes (computer box plus separate keyboard and mouse). Only given one shipping label. Asked for second shipping label. Told use bigger box. Explained that I am using original packaging with OWC shipping as two boxes. Told that I can use the same label for both boxes. The issued label states 1 of 1. I expect UPS to reject two boxes. I explained this to OWC but no reply. Customer Service is frustrating."

With a small business in Chicago, they were not only the best stocked for Mac peripherals,  but the delivery was quick, and the staff was knowledgeable. I basically bought just about everything I needed from them. Then a couple of years ago I ordered the wrong drive housing...got busy on jobs and forgot about it. I went to return it only to find out I was a few weeks past the 90 day return rule. This was not an expensive housing, but I had no use for it. I called customer service and asked for an exception since I've been a long time customer and I was only a few weeks past the deadline. No exceptions. I ate a drive enclosure and they no longer have a loyal customer. I now purchase everything I need elsewhere unless OWC is the ONLY option or the closeout price is too low to pass up. Petty attitude, I know and it was my fault, but they made no effort to make me a satisfied customer, I make no effort to be a loyal customer."

I placed an order for a product that they processed on my credit card but it doesn't show up on my account.   I tried calling them and they say it can't be found.  After a back and forth with playing 100 questions and wasting 20 minutes of my time to figure out what is going on, they suddenly decide that it is because the Canadian system doesn't track orders.  It did get shipped.  It still doesn't show on my OWC account page, so apparently I now need to keep my original order Email pinned inside my software so that I can reference it when something goes wrong.   This is likely going to be a bone of contention as what I did get from OWC was DOA.  In the unit wouldn't recognize both the drives, the LED lights didn't totally work and there was a loud crackling noise and the unit shut down disconnecting everything.   This tags several problems.1. There is only support for USA customers.  Well, the will support canada but not really.  You cannot contact Canada Support as there isn't any, and the USA support it limited as they don't support products bought from their Canadian store. 2. As they don't have my purchase linked, they seem to have real trouble finding the sale and it takes multiple more steps to get any resolution.I did however upgrade them from my initial 1 star to three as they haven't totally hung me out to dry and if I agree to drive out to their Toronto warehouse location, then I might be able to swap it for a new one.  (I won't take a refurbished unit)"

It doesn't give OWC customers a one stop shopping source.I still like OWC, its just that I think B&H is quicker, has a better selection, and is a bit better at customer service, although their depth of expertise is shallower. In the past OWC, although more expensive, was a pretty sure bet for technical support.I especially don't like what they are doing to SoftRAID support."

When I contacted OWC to let them know the package was most likely lost, they gave me the generic reply with how long shipping can take and to get back to them after that time had expired (about 2 weeks later).  This seemed like poor customer service as I had told them I had already spoken with UPS and they were pretty much agreeing the package was lost.  After an email or two, I seemed to be redirected to someone else who handled the rest of the communications.  I continued to provide updates to OWC from UPS and their replies were the only emails I received from them.  After letting them know I saw on UPS that a claim was provided to them a few days prior, I finally got an email saying my refund would be processed.  OWC could have reached out to me occasionally to provide updates or at least make it appear they were doing something.  Instead I was emailing my updates and hoping to hear something from them that gave me hope I would receive something.  Thus I'm only giving 3 stars."

I get their newsletters in the email and read every word and look at products they link to in the email.  They are a terrific company that I have ordered from a number of times in the past and I'm very satisfied with their products.I ordered on Sunday the 9th, my delivery date is Friday the 14th.  5 days isn't that bad (better than ordering anything from Apple!).  Amazon delivers overnight."

I did call tech support and Evan was very good at answering my question and I think overall OWC is a good outfit at what they do and seems very organized and wanting to please their customers.  I had the same problem when I had ordered another battery replacement years ago and had the same problem of not being able to hook up to my computer iTunes since the battery was non-functional.

I had Denver taken apart an apple device. I\u2019ve never even taken apart a laptop, but I needed to replace those batteries and get the outer shell seated more optimally with the remaining screws.OWC allowed me that is in permission but as in provided to me information about what I needed and how to replace the laptop battery. And since I had always found the items at OWC were priced either appropriately or just really great sales. Because of that trust I then decided to purchase a new laptop battery from OWC.The early 2015, MacBook Pro is now humming along without any issues.OWC is the place for all your Apple needs. Great staff Great priced. Great products."

My only issue and I'm not sure it's an issue is that putting the display panel back onto the iMac is almost impossible for one person to do.  You only get one shot at perfecting the alignment before laying it down onto the tape.  I've done this before and I get it very close but it's never perfectly lined up and I do have a small gap on the bottom of the panel.  It would probably be easier if you had a friend to help align it just before laying it in place."

Oh, and in looking at power cords sold separately by this company, I did not find they carry what's required to power this device. I am simply fortunate I had the proper spec power cord just lying around, or else I bought an expensive paperweight."

It was very simple and efficient to order from them. I have used them before and there products were excellent so repeat customer.
