The only \u201cfix\u201d I would suggest is to be able to disable the auto-categorize feature altogether. That feature is likely a benefit to most, but my circumstances make the auto-categorize feature an annoyance when it comes up after denying it. But, otherwise, GREAT APP! I know I recoup the monthly charge every month simply because it captures every drive."

The only reason I didn\u2019t give it 5 stars is that it does not calculate your total kms driven so when you drive over the 5000 km mark it does not automatically drop from .70c/km to .64c/km. Looks like you have to keep track when you drive over 5000 kms and the re-calculate at the lower rate."
