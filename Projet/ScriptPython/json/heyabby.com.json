          "Contenu": "Half and half 5 stars one box But 1 star on the other one. Well got 2 of them one of them is in excellent condition, no dings dents deformities door lines are correctly. Everything is perfect. However, the second one does have a defect within the metal in the inside on the lower bottom. The welding is separating from the door you can see from the paint. That\u2019s not good quality control in my book, wood is smash on the back left side, thank God it does not affect installing the feet when I put them on. I\u2019ve seen this on Discord from other users pictures the same deformity in the same spot. I don\u2019t have the numbers of how many users this affect but I going to take a look into it and see if I can get some statistical numbers to see about this deformity in this particular location where the damage is. It\u2019s more along the lines of quality control, and not damage. But it does cause light leaks which are visible which makes me feel bad and I don\u2019t like to feel bad, and now have to buy some weather strips to fix a brand new item that came, think about that for a moment. Fixing a brand new item, maybe by their company standards this is a acceptable, but not for me it\u2019s not I expect the item to come in the condition that it\u2019s advertised in, not in any less especially for this type of money that paid. So know I have to wrap the box in a skin because I can\u2019t stand the sight to look at the dent. It\u2019s like looking at a dented Lamborghini off lot it really chap's my hide. I have seen other Abby box\u2019s from the \u201cDiscord\u201d and the damage was way more fare severe than mine, so I consider myself lucky. So if you\u2019re thinking about ordering one of these you can \u201cbut just keep in mind\u201d that there is probability of a 50/50 chance that your box that you ordered will have this deformity in the lower mid bottom of the door. I don\u2019t want to send it back in fear of appraisal that the next unit I may get maybe in worse condition than this unit is in. So guess I\u2019m just gonna have to live with, I shouldn\u2019t have to though. Everything else synced up with the app works perfectly no hitch\u2019s with both machines no problems at all whatsoever with the \u201cAPP\u201d. I am happy that I didn\u2019t order the OG or the Black edition considering, if the dent probability is gonna be the same, what would you wanna have dented Volvo or dented Ferrari? I like the company and I like the products that they sell, I will still do business with them, these review is for \u201cNEW USERS\u201d to make an educated intelligent decision on whether or not you should buy it or not. How do I feel about it? YES it\u2019s worth it still even with the deformity, I would still buy it. But you may or may not feel that way about it that decision is up to you. There are on sale at the moment. I purchased two 420 boxes. Man I hope this helps new buyers."

          "Contenu": "Edit: Hey abby - I couldnt finish growing my plant in the expensive Hey abby box. I would not deem that as successful! If customers thinking the product isn't worth it is fine.. I guess you won't last long. Not worth it. There wasn't anything for humidity control which is necessary for a healthy plant. I was told by support to put a towel over the box (didn't help) and mist. I ended up having to mist A LOT. I'm glad I waited to review after actually growing a plant because now there is humidity control, however, you have to pay more as its an add on. It should be included! It should have been in the ORIGINAL DESIGN. Also, THE BOX IS TOO SMALL. You can hardly fit a plant in there as is, now you have to fit accessories? It's not a good investment as it comes now. Our plant which was a smaller strain was getting too big. We consulted with support and they didn't even know what to do. We had to take our plant out (light burn) which grew even more so we couldn't even use the abby. The reminders and guides are very helpful (while the plant fits), however, everything else just makes it not worth it."

I paid over a thousand dollars for a product that has not worked as advertised since I received it.  The customer service it terrible.  Hey Abby has sent me parts to try and fox myself with no instructions.  I have stated that I want a replacement box.  Not my money back.  I want what I paid for.  Nothing\u2026.  I bought directly from Hey Abby I regret that I wished I would have purchased from Amazon.  My advice to someone reading is to contact the company with an issue before you buy to see how frustrating it is dealing with Hey Abby.  I understand that I got a bad unit.  I read the vastly positive reviews before I bought.  It\u2019s a good looking box.  A bit louder that I expected.  Sounds like a fish-tank.Hey Abby reply\u2019s of 1 on 1 support is not the issue. THE BOX IS DEFECTIVE.  The light does not go into sleep mode.  It has never turned off unless I turn the power off switch.  They are Not standing behind the product.  Before buying Beware."

Within 2 months the temp sensors were not working.  So far I have replaced the board, the temp sensors, and the pump twice and it has been in use less than a year.  Now the machine has a buzzing sound so loud I had to put the unit in spare room and Abby is telling me it is not a quality issue.  How is it not a quality issue when the box is not working as intended.  They will not support me to full resolution on this issue and they tell me my box is out of warranty. Meanwhile the issue started when the box was in warranty and never resolved. They do not stand by their product.  I do not recommend.  Get the vivosun grow box!  The only thing they have going for them in the grow consultant.  He rocks."

Filed a dispute with the credit card company since they're not responding. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this product. Their response is disingenuous. They offered a $50 credit on a thousand dollar box and that\u2019s only after 2 weeks of no response. These guys are terrible. The only way to get a response is to go on discord.

          "Contenu": "My issue is now going on it\u2019s 7th week.  Still no resolve.  My Hey Abby OG light has never gone into sleep mode (turned off). The light has always stayed on since day 1.  First Hey Abby has had me take the back panel off.  (The screws are about the cheapest screws made.  If you were to have to do this task make sure that the Phillips screwdriver has a flat tip.) I was to check all of the connections. No resolve.  Then is was determined that I had to replace my door lock.  That requires taking half of the box apart.  Without any directions mind you. That was said to be the cause of my issues.  It was not.  Issue continues. Then the issue was thought to be some internal internet issues that also reported as the cause of the light staying on and said to have been repaired from the home office.  The issue still continues.  I would not recommend doing business with Hey Abby.  I have asked that I be sent a replacement several times and gotten no where.  They can have this box back and have the engineers figure out what is the cause. Not me.  Customer Service is Terrible.  All attempts to fix my problem is via email and can be several minutes to days later ( weekends) before you get a reply.  I am asking Hey Abby to make good on what I bought from them for over one thousand dollars.  I paid for a box that works. That is not what I was sent. I believe that this Box probably is what is what they said it is.  That\u2019s why I bought it.  But dealing with this company is terrible.  You have been warned."

Asked about a return and they ignored me. Customer service can take over a day to respond. They ignore your questions when they do respond. Every box includes a 3 month subscription, but when you buy a box + subscription you only get part of the subscription because they include the original included subscription as part of the deal. I only received 6 months of fertilizer when I ordered my box which includes 3 months + 6 months subscription. Asked about what they would cover for a return since the water issue is a build issue that they knew about and said they will address in future models, and the latch problems. They will not even talk to me about a return even though I reported problems in the time frame. Also took them a week to tell me where I could leave a review."

          "Contenu": "I recently purchased an automated grow box with high hopes for a hassle-free and efficient growing experience, but unfortunately, my overall experience has been far from satisfactory. I have to rate this product with just one star due to numerous issues that I've encountered during my time using it.The primary concern I have is the severely limited yield, maxing out at a mere 4 ounces. Achieving even this modest yield requires an excessive amount of daily attention and care. The promise of automation falls short, as the machine demands constant vigilance to maintain plant health.One of the major letdowns is the inability of the grow box to prevent root rot and mold growth. Despite weekly deep cleaning, these issues persist, making it an ongoing battle to keep the environment conducive to plant growth.Moreover, the unit emits strong odors even with the supposedly effective filters. This not only compromises the discreetness promised by the product but also raises concerns about the effectiveness of the filtration system.Light leakage is another significant problem I've encountered. The grow box fails to contain light effectively, disrupting the necessary light cycles for plant growth. This oversight is particularly troubling for those who require a controlled environment for their crops.The internal design flaw involving magnets for hooks is baffling. These magnets, intended to assist in organizing and securing items inside the box, instead leave behind unsightly scratches, diminishing the overall quality and aesthetics of the unit.Lastly, the nutrient solution provided has proven to be too harsh, causing leaf burn and further complicating the delicate balance of plant care. Adjusting the nutrient levels has been a constant struggle, leading to additional stress on the plants.In conclusion, my experience with this automated grow box has been marred by a multitude of issues that outweigh any potential benefits. I would caution fellow growers to thoroughly research and consider alternative options before investing in this particular product. It falls short on multiple fronts and does not live up to the promises made by the manufacturer."

The technical support is all done via email. So you may wait twenty min before someone reads and ask another question.  The customer support is terrible.  Again The customer support is horrible.  My advice to anyone is:  To before buying try and contact customer service.  1 out of 7 calls was answered.  I believe the customer service person to be someone who is working from home.

I did not pay to be on the floor unscrewing things, pressing wires and tabs Checking this videoing that,  not to mention the now 4 packs of fertilizer that has been waisted.  When I read reviews I read the best and the worst. My advice is to Try and contact with an issue before you buy and there is an issue. Mine was a lemon.  Otherwise the box looks good and seems well constructed.  Mine just does not work as advertised."

Good thing, it looked good in my kitchen before having to buy black weather striping to seal the leak but that didn\u2019t work so then bought white magnet strips. Definitely doesn\u2019t look like the pictures. Not my first grow, I actually did 20,000 plants in my state with a university and own a business which I wanted to sell the Abby in. Not a chance, even if they did distribute wholesale which I wouldn\u2019t ask at this point as I\u2019m pretty sure they are all in china. They answer no earlier than 10-11pm est on discord and no earlier than 4:30am via email. I\u2019ll use them until something else comes out since I suppose it still looks better than a tent in my kitchen. No issue has been resolved to date btw other than a small refund when I have 2 boxes that don\u2019t work right. One doesn\u2019t even drop the nutrients that come stuck together because the solenoid doesn\u2019t work. Anyway, give it a year or two and if they are still around then buy with caution."

Nothing with this company is cheap and everything depends on the app which I am having doubts about for long term stability. App goes down and we are stuck with a worthless expensive machine. I have had several challenges from shutting the door which should be basic to understanding the real purpose of the very limited dial which looks nice but does very little for me. Twist to open and gives us the impression that it is valuable but still don\u2019t see it. The instructions for this were terrible because they simply say automated by app. The app took a bit to get used to which is ok but things are backwards at times and not instinctive to the user. Took several weeks to understand about the expensive help that we pay for. Then the help was not reading my questions and giving me half answers. The window was stained when I got it and I think it is between the coating and glass. The main machine is cute and appears to be solid but all these failures and issues makes me believe it is just another Chinese made product in the end. Yes made in China."

Here are my pros/cons so far, but I am only at Week 3 Day 1 for my 2 boxes (seed has tap root but does not have roots and stem yet to be transplanted)Pros: easy to setup; app walks you through setup and stages with both video and bulleted steps; good size; quiet; Cons: 1) I ordered the 3 mo subscription for 1 box and a year subscription for the other box, by the time my boxes finally arrived I was informed that my subscription ended for the box with the 3 mo subscription, but the box just arrived. The subscription shoukd start on the day the box is delivered, not months before when my order could not be fullfilled due to limited stock.2) The box itself is nicely designed with 1 major flaw, every smart electrical accessory that is sold for the box connects with a USB cord but the box only has 1 USB port. If HeyAbby is selling/advertising to buy these accessories to improve the health of the plants, they should either sell a splitter too or be very clear, that only 1 accessory can be plugged into the box itself.I bought 3 accessories for each box, before the boxes were delivered so I had no idea...unfortunately I now eithet need to rotate out each accessory when not in use (which defeats the purpose of smart accessories), or I need to run cords between the door seems to plug in externally.3) When I reached out for assistance setting up my smart cam with my boxes, I recieved time out errors. I reached out to support for help with this, but all I was told is to read the manual and reboot my cameras. I did both, neither resolved the issue. I tried reaching back out to support and was given the manual to read again and was told it is a network error. I checked my network, it sees the cameras and shows they are receiving signals from my network. I do not feel the support is as good as it is advertised. I waited days to get my first response, the speed of the support is not good if it does not resolve the issues. If there is not a follow up, then the quality control of support needs to be improved."

          "Titre": "I have a few suggestions.",
          "Contenu": "I have a few suggestions.As a person completely new to growing cannabis and hydroponics, along with a ton of mistakes I made I am offering the following suggestions.1. Instructions should be broken down step by step.  I watched the video for the water tank.  Nowhere in the video does it show you what you mean by \u201cin between the sensors\u201d or where the sweet spot is.  I was overfilling my tank by an inch.  I need a visual to help me understand what you mean, and I am sure I am not the only one.  The same can go for every video.  The only one I actually think covers everything is the recent smart humidifier post today.Water\u2026..Yes the unit might for some be successful with tap water but dependent on where a person lives that could change success.  For example, my water has 300ppm before adding anything. So pouring in nutrients in reservoir makes what should be 1400 or less ec, becomes way over 1500.  PHing before adding nutrients does not accurately help the plant because the nutrients affect ph.  So nutrients should be mixed into the water prior to filling.Next.  Adjust ph and walk away from the medium for about 20 mins (the time it takes to clean everything after pumping out.  I feel this is a better method\u2026.so2. My suggestion:  Buyers should obtain a 5 gal pail, ph up and down, reverse osmosis bottle water (even if it is from a store as mine cost a $1 for 3 gallons), a ph/ppm/ec pen, and some good bacteria to support roots.  My experience, following your instructions I gave my clone two episodes of nute burn.  I struggled with balancing the water to get the numbers right. I added things which eventually affected the smell of my water.Tonight:  I changed the water, used reverse osmosis bottled water\u2026.. tested before doing anything and ppm was 11 ec was about 24\u2026..ph 8+.  Adding nutrients (silver and gold) stirring alot, then Great White Premium Mycorrhizae.  Waited ten minutes and tested ph.  Ph was in range 6.01.  No adjustments needed (where before I was adding and adjusting).  Another tip: buyers should not add ph down and then back up\u2026.I didn\u2019t know it could hurt the plant\u2026.I was too busy trying to get the right number and adding way too much.Shipping:  I already gave feedback to Jacob.  The shipping packages used by your distribution centre are plastic envelopes.  The boxes for the humidifier and fan I bought are as thin as gift boxes.  Same goes for the seed kit you sent me.  They were damaged, this will lead to you dealing with upset customers.  My unit (grow box) also was damaged where the straps rubbed against the cardboard and metal.  I have sent pictures.Support email help:  I find its harder to hear back in a timely way from your email for shipping claims and or support.  Discord offers immediate help when your staff are on.  I am still waiting to hear if the items agreed upon via email to compensate me for the damaged product are shipped.The staff on discord are great. I am sure I will have more feedback but\u2026..somewhere you should have a disclaimer on app chat and in discord\u2026\u2026advice provided by other growers is at the risk of issues.  I listened to someone who asked me why I didn\u2019t top my plant.  As shown to Vee tonight and Jacob\u2026it was a poor choice on my part to listen to the person, because my plant was too young and had already suffered shock twice.Regardless of the above feedback, I am enjoying the experience and would love to give the company 5 stars.  If you could try to do some of the following I could:1. Videos showing every step, just like the humidifier video you showed today (June 19, 2023).  Do one specifically showing water level in tank, one showing every step of changing the water. Etc etc etc2. Mixing nutrients before putting everything in the tank, followed by a ph test (a complete video of that, including using the tester).3. Suggestions on root support like hydroguard or good bacteria for those who want it (Canadians do not have easy access to hydroponic grown clones and deal with shock because we have to transition plants from soil to water).4. Shipping packages that protect the purchase, so you have less claims, and less unhappy customers who received damaged products5. Quicker responses to emails or people (like me) will default to asking staff in Discord6. Communication on replacement items, I am still waiting on my email asking about why the unit I received in May 2023 is not with the updated parts and updated nutrients, mine are stuck together7. Cautions about listening to other growers who do not represent Hey Abby and could lead to a poor experience for a newbieThat is all for now.  Vee was helpful tonight."

Although I'm only starting my first grow in the box, I can tell that I made the right decision. The box was completely plug and play besides installing the carbon filters, which took about 45 seconds. Then i just downloaded the app and followed their instructional videos. Any question I have are answered in a timely manner through the chat option on their website. If its something I want to know fast then there is a whole community on discord giving out tips, tricks, and just overall experiences with the Abby. Makes it very easy for first time box growers to skip a couple of dumb mistakes. Its also a community that the owners are actively engaging with and keeping informed and updated on new models and app technology, while also holding events. I've been a member for a month and have already won a free hoodie through a Halloween give away. As far as the company and the product, they are exactly what they claim to be. I cant speak for results just yet but barring any user error, I have a feeling this might be exactly what I've been looking for in a grow box."

The Hey Abby app is a cluster of confusion if you're not a active tech minded person. I'm convinced that if I had a visual outline of where to find the information I needed, I could have completed my first grow without any need to ask for help. As with most new products, there are almost always a glitch or two along the way. I accepted that and appreciated the fast response to my questions/issues. Some were software oriented that were dealt with quickly. Others were just my inability to locate the answers/procedures that were available on the Abby app if I had known where/how to find them. So all in all, after my frustrations and anxieties, I had a great first grow and I would do it all over again for the experience. If you do something right the first time, you haven't learned anything. If you pay attention, you will learn from your mistakes.  Things will only get better.Side note; the Discord message board. It brought back memories from the early 80's message boards that I attempted to use.  I am not a techie and gave up with trying to figure out how and where to post any questions/concerns."

This was my seventh Hey abby box it was damaged in transition to my residency during shipping. UPS had damaged the product so bad the top was separated from the core base triggered, having to send the box back to hey abby, this, of course, was upsetting and discouraging this took about three weeks to resolve during that time I ended up making a friend in the business. Bruno has answered all my questions, as well as put my discomfort to ease over the last five weeks. I wanted to send kudos, and a review that reflected the outstanding customer service he\u2019s presented to me, this was a difficult and upsetting transaction when you\u2019ve been waiting for so many weeks to receive the product only to find out that it is damaged beyond usage. I wanted to say great job and keep up the good work. I\u2019ve really appreciated you and I hope this message proves my appreciation , thank you"
