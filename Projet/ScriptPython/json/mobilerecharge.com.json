          "Contenu": "I am extremely disappointed with the mobile recharge service. For the second time in a row, I encountered the same problem I recharged 1539.27 AFN, but only received 1265 AFN. This discrepancy is unacceptable and creates a sense of deception.I urge the company to address and rectify this issue promptly. Customers should be able to trust the system to provide the correct amount upon recharge. Failure to resolve this matter will undoubtedly lead to a loss of trust and confidence in your services"

I purchased two vouchers which did not work, and received and error which said the voucher numbers were wrong. Me, being the loyal customer who thinks that MobileRecharge cares about their customers, emailed them explaining the situation. They go on to say that they contacted the telecom company and they said I had recharged them. I sent them screenshots of the error to prove I did not, but that didn\u2019t seem to phase them. Long story short, they only care about taking your money, and if things go south, you\u2019re on your own. Use at your own risk."

          "Contenu": "I had an absolutely dreadful experience with this mobile recharge service. I ordered $35 NZD with the promise that the recipient would receive 1529.46 AFN(after tax), but what actually happened was far from what was advertised.The beneficiary only received 1257.00 AFN once the transaction was completed, which is a sizable difference from the amount that was promised. Because I was obviously mislead and the service provider did not fulfill their promise, I was rather upset with this service.I contacted their customer service to report this, hoping for a solution or, at minimum, a reimbursement for the difference. To my dismay, no effort was taken to address the matter and my complaint was treated with apathy.I would strongly urge people not to use this mobile recharge service because it is untrustworthy and unreliable. I regret ever using their service because of this frustrating and expensive experience. Save yourself the trouble and look elsewhere for a more honest and reputable provider.I have photo evidence from the receiver that they only received 1257.00 AFN"

          "Contenu": "I supect MobileRecharge is a scam...I'm an Italian resident and did two recharge attempts today towards a Lycamobile US number.1. the first attempt, I used my PayPal account with my AmEx card (which I use almost every day for eBay, e-commerce, etc.), anyway my order n. 26208475 has been cancelled (why?) 8 hours after purchase (and successful payment/debit on my credit card). Since I received a cancellation email with terms for refund, I still hope that I'll finally get such a refund sooner or later (even if I still don't get why my valid PayPal account and AmEx active and working card didn't work for them...); let me add also that I called them twice, since they needed verification on my side, which I did. I called and responded to their questions related with my personal data.2. after this initial failure (through PayPal and even though I gave all the required answers), I retried with my credit card directly (no PayPal this time) but this time, after correct verification with American Express and being debited the second time, I even didn't get any order number! In my history now, there's no orders at all!!! So I've been forced to call them (the third time) to ask for clarification and was told by Mr. Santiago that this second order was cancelled too! But after my order on the website there's still no trace neither of the previous nor of the second order! I then received a cancellation email from the customer service stating that I'll receive a refund in 2 working days, which I do hope so... Anyway my credit card now appears saved in my account (as it should be for *successful* orders!), so I decided to cancel it to protect my security.I had a very bad experience with MobileRecharge, a waste of time and money (three phone calls to UK and US) with no result (and with no apparent reason from their side).Moreover I have still the problem to top up my Lycamobile US number for my daughter which is a big issue for me.Be careful if you really want/need to do business with them, little traceability, no receipt, ne response to written customer support contacts, no log/history of past orders (with their status). Very unprofessional and risky."

It would be good if there was an option to increase the options by 13% to avoid this waste.  Or even better \u2013 allow the us to type any value.

The app is working fine, we haven't registered any glitches lately. What you need to do is to update the app. Please get the latest version. It will work fine for you. We have investigated your case and the cause for the issues you've reported is using a 2-year-old iOS MobileRecharge app version, which is very likely to lead to unexpected behavior. Your current version is 2.5.12 (27 versions behind the latest release). So, please go to the AppStore, search the MobileRecharge app, and update it. Also, a very useful way to keep your app updated is to activate your automatic updates."

New fees and taxes sprung on you out of no where, or complete website meltdown as you're trying to complete a transaction.  The while \"Chatting\" with support the chat keeps timing out or just flat out shutdown. REALLY annoying! \r Again, thus far at least my billing issues have been rectified, I just don't want to have to contact support every time for a basic transaction. \rThis appears to be my only choice, and they have not totally screwed met yet so I will continue to use them.  If all of my issues are due to the vendor company \"Digicel\" then I apologize, but at minimum they need to shore up their website, and some of their agent take some customer service training."

Mobile recharge needs 3d security varification. It is not enought that yr bank approve this transaction. They have their own security measures. Ok. U spent hours or day with bad wi-fy in unknown country to go to bank website, set 3d security, talking to ur bank by phone... Done. U try to refill again but no... U can not do anything because previous transaction still in progress... U create new account, repeat all again, all is ok, but no... U have a mail with request to contact mobile recharge team to confirm yr account. How can u do it in rouming? Don't warry, they can call u, believing, that incaming calls are free for u... U spent 5$ for conversation with them and confirm yr account. 1 day and 5$ lost to refill yr new sim for 10$. May be it is too much?"

I have on several occasions to numbers I previously sent via your service remain in a pending status for hours.  Which frankly is counter to what is required which is to get airtime on a phone.I know one can assume perhaps its the cell phone provider.  However, on several occasions while your service is still in a pending status I, use my other airtime recharge service, and airtime which arrives almost instantly.  SO its not the cell phone provider causing the delay.Additionally, when a transaction does fail after remaining in a pending status there is no feed-back. The transaction just goes from \"pending\" to no record. Its like the transaction was never tried. Thus; your system only show successful transactions. Yet my PayPal will show a transaction pending charge for your failed transaction.  For the record ALL that I have described just occurred today 3 Dec 2017.To be honest I only continue to try your service because you allow a larger amount to be sent while the other and more reliable service has smaller limits thus more transactions is required. Yup! that's my experience."

I learned about Mobile Recharge when I discovered I had run out of data. I was very happy to find out that I could add more data rather than buying a new SIM card. I try to be very careful to turn off my data when I have wifi and to only turn it on when I need it. Unfortunately, I still run out quickly and never really understood how many Gigabytes I need.  While adding GB has been easy with  Mobile Recharge, the experience of running out of data has been confusing and frustrating."

I do not like how small the packages are and how quick they run out. For the price I pay a month with constantly refilling his balance it should last more than 4 days at a time. I feel the company would do better to have an unlimited plan, I\u2019ve honestly contemplated sending him an ATT phone from my plan for an extra $150 a month. Only reason I haven\u2019t is because I\u2019m not sure the service would be as good there. There are lots of pluses to this company with Telcel but also lots of negatives. I\u2019m honestly torn with giving this review now, but i hope in the future Telcel comes out with a completely unlimited plan ! On the plus side the site is very easy to get around and quick, which I greatly like."

But checked my credit card and they sure charged me!--------------Next day:  I'm changing my one star review to three stars because they did follow up the day after this review, called me on my phone, fixed it, and then called again to make sure I got the credit.  It was too late to help me out in a pickle (I am in a hotel room with a sprained ankle, so it was annoying that this didn't work when I really needed my phone -- I had to limp to the nearest credit charging machine to refill my SIM), but I appreciate that they followed up and fixed the problem fairly promptly.  I probably won't use this service again in this country (Kazakhstan), but I appreciate that there could have been some technical glitch beyond their control."

There should be more allowable amounts. e.g: $50.00, $75.00, $100.00 Or, maybe another form for amounts over a specific amount.       1. It is time consuming to be forced to complete several requests in order to send a specific amount to a single person.       2. Seems unfair to pay Processing Fees per each amount needed in order to send total desired amount of monies to a single/same individual.* Compliments on your {a} Instant Security measures {b} Immediate response to my e-mail request for clarification.Thank You"
