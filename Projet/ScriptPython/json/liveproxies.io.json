          "Contenu": "I do like the proxies and I especially like the limited IP's concepts that Live pioneered. For almost, every site live has been the go to. I think the fact of running a max of 350 tasks for 1:1 sites helps to limited data waste but in the end I end up with left over data and no time to use it during the limited windows. Not everyone is running a hundred instances for YS anymore and using a lot of data is a thing of the past. At this point all I use live for is for domain change shopify releases and times I need ips for proxy protected sites. Meaning I can not use all the data in the required time. I think that this makes people not want to buy the product in fear of losing value they are paying for and I think the Live team should instead of with-holding users unused data to be sold to the next customer plans should be changed to have increased ips and unlimited time frames. I understand this is a business that needs to make profit but with this solution people will inevitably use data at a faster rate with more ips and you will get people renewing and buying standby plans more often. Also just sell the product at bottom dollar and until your out of stock instead of having buying windows with discounts. If you sell the 350ip plan for 150 all the time instead of making less and giving out discount codes. You could make more if not the same and have happier customers with an incredibly high customer repurchase rate."

Ever since I joined Live its been working out great for me, whether it is Shopify release where they turned proxy protection On or its hibbett where PX flags proxies, Live Proxies would go thru any type of proxy protection. I have made so much profit using these proxies and its just been consistent for me since the beginning. In addition, their help is always active on discord and help center so if you ever get stuck with a error or something then they would help me out always on time. I really appreciate Live for making it easier for me. Thank you!"
