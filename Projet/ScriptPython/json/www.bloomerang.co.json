          "Contenu": "Bloomerang is a great product, but they are attempting to create a monopoly for their own payment processor by forcing you to use their own payment processor, rather than Stripe if you want to accept e-check / ACH donations.  Bloomerang has deliberately written the code not to support ACH giving, if you use Stripe, and all it would take is one change to their code, that they won't do, because they are trying to force use of their own payment processor.Here's a message I received from Stripe, when attempting to enable ACH payments in Stripe.  It appears that if the Bloomerang code used \"automatic_payment_methods\" (as suggested by the error message below in Stripe) then I wouldn't have to completely change payment processors to Bloomerang Payments, which impacts saved recurring giving, accounting, stored credit cards, and donor satisfaction.Stripe Error Message:We've detected that you are using payment_method_types to configure payment methods. To manage payment methods from this page, replace payment_method_types with automatic_payment_methods."

They have great educational articles and resources.  The platform allows me to keep track of my donor database, receive and track donations through integrations, and plan events.  I send out email communications including newsletters and acknowledgements.That said, there are some kinks.  The billing portal is not up to date with our current info, and I cannot get it changed.  Phone support is an extra cost.  But I have found the email chat to be sufficient most of the time.  Some other platforms and upgrades (read more money) within Bloomerang offer better user interfaces for donors, but I like the cost (read less money) for the basics."

          "Contenu": "We've been using Bloomerang for just over 10 months now. It was very scary looking ahead into changing CRM software at our nonprofit, particularly as the switchover was going to be during our Christmas appeal, the busiest time of the year. But the Bloomerang staff were excellent, anticipating what our issues were likely to be, and creating a path that took us through the changes without a \"slowdown\" in returning our thanks to our donors, and without a pileup of work for our data entry folks - two of the things I was most worried about. Our monthly recurring program came over to Bloomerang seamlessly, and with improvements. Reports are SO much easier! Working with specific groups of people is also something we can do now with much more control. The one area that isn't quite as complete as our previous CRM is the Tribute area, for honor and memorial cards to be sent out. We knew this area wasn't fully developed in Bloomerang going in to our conversion, but we decided there were so many more benefits that we would bank on finding a work around. We are not sorry! The work around was easy (we set up custom fields), it works well, and though the relationships involved in the giving/sending of cards are not fully traceable in our database, we have found that this is only a secondary issue. The actual function of merging and printing the cards is so much easier and faster than before. We are continually finding things that surprise and please us. Just yesterday I heard my colleague say, \"I think I'm in love!\" She had just completed in a few minutes what she had previously dreaded, because it would take her several hours of convoluted work every year. I have found this true in my own tasks, too. Bloomerang beautifully simplifies things, and we are only beginning to scratch the surface of what this robust solution can help us do!"
