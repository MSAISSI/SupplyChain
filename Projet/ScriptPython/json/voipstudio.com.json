Sometimes we try to answer the phone but nothing happens.\rVoipdito has potential in the future but I would not recommend them now."

I signed up for the service, considering I'll be able to answer my calls from the app. The worst thing is, you have to keep the app always open to get it work properly. This is unlike any other app such as WhatsApp, facebook or other messaging or calling service. The second is, even after keeping the app open always, I don't receive calls, but I find in my email that I have a voicemail. I should receive voicemail only when I don't answer calls. In addition, sometimes, I only get just 2 ringtones and the phone is cut off. It's difficult to answer calls within 2 ringtones. They must work on the app, so that t works properly; or else they should not advertise - \"answer and manage calls from app.\""

I requested a post-pay account, was told that this was fine - ported all my numbers in and then bang, got told I needed to add credit to make calls... this doesn't seem like a post pay account to me.We are a business, we can't be adding credit every month - PAYG is not a normal business model for B2B.I decided to leave and yes it's in the terms but got hit by a extortionate porting out fee, watch out for that. Incredibly high when most providers including BT/TalkTalk and most other providers would not dream of charging a porting out fee.I am in the process of porting my numbers out, some of them haven't completed yet and they have completely locked my account, meaning I may have lost numbers. Just another reason this is not for B2B use.If you are a proper company looking for a phone system do not use VOIP Studio."

We called the number and it simply told us to submit a ticket which we had done.  We just went in circles for 5 days trying to get a payment method added only to learn that ONLY ONE ACCOUNT was allowed to do that, despite them sending notifications to MULTIPLE accounts that we needed to add a payment method.

The call quality was so bad we had to give up and find another solution - not great considering we were speaking with a new client. \r We have only been using the service for one week. We would have liked to trial it for longer before committing to the service, however the one month trial only includes 100 minutes which we used quickly. Another week of use should put us in a position to decide if it is fit for purpose as a long term solution. It is certainly well priced."

I take great exception to their team telling me the problem is our end all the time (despite trying on laptop, iPhone, France, UK, NZ etc..).\r I'll finish my 2 weeks remaining on trial and see if it improves.  At this point its not very useable.  \r I'm also not keen on hidden \"premium\" numbers.  They say that its all you can eat for a flat fee to landlines for example (UK and abroad) yet charge additional cash credit for \"premium\" numbers, of which there seems a never ending supply.  Again, they claim this is standard but the same numbers with our other VOIP provider are included.  Go figure."

          "Contenu": "I rolled out VoIPstudio in our small office to replace our somewhat antiquated PBX and physical phones following an office move. Setting up the new system was fast and easy - much faster and cheaper than transferring our existing landline service from one location to another within Central London (traditional telephony is appalling!). This lowered our fixed and variable telephony costs significantly, especially as we later expanded into a Canadian office; the free in-network calls and conferences have saved us many international calls. I was initially pleased with the full-featured system and responsive customer support.However, caveat emptor: the PC client has many issues with functionality that have persistently gone unfixed despite repeated requests over the years. I currently have four tickets 'Awaiting Support response' for over 18 months.Contacts do not sync properly. International phone numbers are not saved correctly. There are many, many call quality issues - nearly every call has audio issues on one side or the other. The supplied PC client in particular distorts audio if the computer is used for anything else. We now mostly use third-party clients on Android/Windows phones, but those have limited functionality unless paid for, which would significantly increase the cost of this solution. In response, we have been told the system works better with dedicated hardware phones, which contradicts the impression given by the website that PC softphones can be used, which was a major factor in our decision to buy.These issues have been extremely frustrating and from past experience are unlikely to ever be addressed. My team have repeatedly asked me to source an alternate supplier, but so far the system is just barely usable enough that changing over has not been a high enough priority. The pricing is also very competitive. As such, we have continued to use VoIPstudio despite the persistent quality issues until we get a chance to research and implement a better alternative."

          "Contenu": "I have been a customer of VOIPStudio since last year (2014). I started off as a monthly subscriber and when I realized the charges were too high for limited phone usage, I switched to PAYG (pay as you go). That was months ago. for 3.99. Obviously, I didn't realize that setting up numbers as separate users charges you are charged separate fees as well. So while asking why the new number I transported from another VOIP company to VOIPStudio was 5 instead of 3.99, they noticed that I have not been charged 5euros per phone. \r Long story short, nowhere in their website says you will pay 5.00 per phone. when I selected the PAYG, it clearly charges my account for 3.99. If their invoicing is not setup properly to charge the correct amount then it is their problem not mine. I was told now I have to pay for all of this months of not paying the 5 additional fee. VOIPStudio charged my credit card immediately without notification or without my permission or authorization. I noticed the charged while reviewing my credit card.  I asked VOIPStudio whiy they charged my CC since I had no balanace and paid each month. Now, VOIPStudio has raised the invoice again charging me setup fees and monthly fees. I could have left my phone where it was at 5/month fee. Now the same phone is charged 3.99 + 5.00.. Not a great deal...and I will be switching soon again, which cost money as I already paid for porting my phone to VOIPStudio. \r So my current charges went for 11/month to 28+ euros month. I decided to cancel one number (the one I transported in the first placed from another provider) and now that reduced my billing to 23/month. Which is still high for not using the service.\r I also have bad connection/quality using ZOIPER. Not their direct fault as this is a third-party software but I can't really enjoy the service any longer as the only way I can use the service is using ZOIPER and everybody complaints on the phone of the quality (they can't hear me, calls drop in the middle or I cannot connect at all).  Time to look for another solution.\r Over customer service is prompt and always answers my question in a timely manner but I can't use the service. I keep using my cell phone or Skype to make calls.\r Make sure you ask for ALL fees to be disclosed, because their website (when you sign up) or when you asked them, do not tell you this."

This does everything you need at a fraction of the cost.  Also, you can use the system to look like you are dialling out from a mobile, which ring central cannot do.With regards to calls, I find them better quality than ring central."

On deciding to be customer they said I have thirty days to try their system. I was presented with their Dashboard to setup the system. I do have some experience with VoIP and SIP so it wasn't too hard. I did have a couple of questions which were handled by Customer Service Chat. Website has credentials for setting up  IP Phone which went without problem. I provided my own device. They have a softphone available to use to begin with if you wish. Transferring to paid customer was very speedy and the invoices were self explanatory. Cost is very inexpensive on both options. Their manual could be a little more step by step for people not quite as experienced. So far I am satisfied with the results. Look it over and see if it is right for you!"
