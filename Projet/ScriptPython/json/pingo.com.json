          "Contenu": "I have been a Pingo customer since January 2009, and for seven months I've suffered their bad services. Extremely rare were the moments when a call through their 'softphone' (internet phone) went through without major problems - and even when they did, the sound quality was always bad (on both ends). On most days, calling through Pingo was a chore, dialing the number dozens of times over 10-20 minutes until the call finally went through. And don't expect any help from their customer service, whether you contact them via phone or e-mail."

To top it, an auto-top has been done by pingo even though I did not select auto-top when I created the pingo account. Can someone please give me their customer call number (phone number, not the email-id). I want my money back."

I am cancelling the service immediately, if a company can not effectively take care of its customers, it does not deserve my money. BEWARE OF PINGO CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!\r Also, I just found out that this company is not accredited with the BBB (Better Business Bureau). Despite this, the BBB rated it F (Fail) due to the number of complaints and the lack of response of the company to resolve them. AGAIN, BEWARE OF THIS COMPANY PRACTICES"

After we dial the number, we get extended silence and then busy signals, busy signals, wierd ringing sounds, silence and clicks. This morning, in fact, I tried 10 times, but was unable to get through. The helpdesk, who have thick Spanish accents, tells us to wait a half and hour. I wait, still the same. I call back, they say wait a half hour. I tell them that is what you said before, let's get their technical people on the phone, they say they can't do that. This has been going on for two years. I am now searching for alternate international calling options."

You DO NOT MENTION THIS ON YOUR SITE WHERE YOU SELLL YOUR SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC and this is lot right. Stick a note up there that states \"limited to certain cities or areas\". I don't know what the problem is and I am fairly uninterested after months of waiting. Is it so difficult to correct the problem or stop trying to sell a service to the public that does not exist? Really, Pingo is not a bad company and I have had great luck calling from the U.S. but I must agree that the term customer service does not exist in this company and this causes me to question the ethics of a company that behaves in this manner."

When I was able to make a call, the quality was very poor, that the conversations became very difficult. I use to email them about the problems, They were apologizing and offering some credits, and following few more days of acceptable level of service. Then, everything was sliding back to poor service. After I gave a negative review for their cell app, things got even worse. When I contacted them again about the poor service, the representative (Brian Hawkins), without listening the problems, directly asked me if I am willing to change my review about their App, When I refused it, he said 'If you are not happy about the service, maybe this company is not for you\" .I couldn't put it better myself.  I agree with him hundred percent. I think this company is not for me or other people who are looking for a realible service and decent phone connections."

I just added money to my account to make a call. but each time I try to make a call I am given a message which says (every) number that I try to call is invalid. Oh? Really? Please tell me how that is so Pingo. And since their track record concerning customer service is disgusting I am not feeling too confident that the situation will be resolved or that I will get my money back and it is a highly inconvenient and frustrating situation.\r 4. When I inquired about the publicised promotion on their website (which I had taken great pains to follow the procedure stated in order to qualifiy for it) and be credited a certain amount-I never got a response. And I must say the promotional ad is till there on their site!\r From now on I will discourage and successfully convince any person I know who is even thinking about signing up for Pingo and will find another company to use.\r Pingo, honestly, you suck. \rThe high number of horrible reviews says it all. \rGood riddance."

Monday came and went with no service so I sent a couple of E-mails. After the second E-mail my account was disabled! I Have sent 5 E-mails and called multiple times as of right now the only response i have gotten was to refer my complaint to another department. This is such a pain. The biggest problem I have is that my fiancee is in Peru and I spent all my money for this weeks call with Pingo. So now i haven't been able to talk to her all week. The worst part of all is i can look and see where I've been charged on my bank statement. They say it's fraud prevention but it seems like I was the one who was defrauded. All I want is to receive the service I have paid for is that too much to ask? What's the problem with this company it's like they don't really exist!"

I had used pingo for a while until i was disgusted out of my minds and was forced to switch to another company (localphone). what a huge difference. the calls went through every single time, and it was crystal clear. and the rate was less than half of what I was paying for this crap (calling to bangladesh costs only 3.15 cents, and india only 1.5 cents). anyhow, pingo kept sending me promotional offers (literally begging for my money) to sign up for 5 dollars and i will get 5 dollars free. thinking pingo might have improved, i opted to sign up for it. BIG MISTAKE. I never had any calls go through to bangladesh. Even the landlines didnt work. If i got paid for all the time i wasted to get through, i would be a rich man today. anyways, pingo is a horrible company. I can not describe in words how bad this experience is. Please, here is my request to everyone: NO ONE...NOBODY DO ANY BUSINESS WITH PINGO EVER AGAIN.\r It is funny how the customer support people rebut all the posts as if they are listening to the complaints. hey customer support, if u r really doing ur job, why did everyone rate this company 1 star??? why do they keep rating it 1 star. obviously u haven't done squat to change anything. Here is a suggestion, fire these customer care liars and hire some engineers. or just return everyone his or her money and declare bankruptcy because honestly, companies like these should not be allowed to practice business and rob money from people. and PLEASE dont send out BS promotions to people when ur phone lines dont even work. \r I hope i was able to convince everyone how painfull pingo experience truly is."

We called up to explain the issue and we were sent a form letter detailing how to use Pingo, which anybody using this service would already know. Then I emailed with the following:---------------------------------\" I am getting three responses:When I dial 08000015814 I get\"This number is not in service\" or\"We are experiencing high call volumes, please call later\"And when I call 01223655507 I get\"your authentification has failed\" even before I have keyed in my 10 digits. The errors I am getting are new, and hence my concern. I am not being able to use this service at all. Would you please let me know what to do? is ther any other access number that you have for calling from the UK?--------------------------------I haven't heard back from Pingo yet!So I am not sure I can trust Pingo anymoreUPDATE:This is an update in response to the response provided by PINGO.COM to my my first review posted on Dec1, 2019. Doesn\u2019t matter which account I use, I get the same Pingo Experience, not the 95% positive as this provider purports their service to be. Still can\u2019t make any call."

          "Contenu": "First off, let me state that I am a certified ISO 9000, CQA Auditor and have been performing quality audits of companies for well over 10 years.  This is the worst service I have ever encountered.\r We received an e-mail that stated that for the month of September we would receive a $5 credit for every $10 we spent to recharge our account.  We paid the money but the credit never came.  When  I called customer service to make an inquiry I came across a very rude agent who had to ask me multiple times to repeat my information (language barrier).  He then told me that it was my word against theirs and that they were not required to apply the credit unless we could send them a copy of the e-mail.\r I asked him if the e-mail was sent to all customers.  He said yes.  I then asked why we had to provide to them an e-mail that was sent to everyone?  I asked if he could see the transaction of the re-charge.  He said yes.  I then said, \"if the transaction occurred in the time period listed on the promotion, why was the promotion not automatically applied?  He said it is suppose to automatically apply but that our account may not have been eligible.\r Scratching my head I decided to bite, \"ok, why is it not eligible?\"  He said, I dont know, you will have to send us the e-mail to be sure. \r Does that make any sense at all?  I then asked to speak to a supervisor.  He told me that a supervisor was not available but he was the lead.  He then began to berate me and speak over me.  I told him I was the customer and he needed to listen to what I had to say and address my concerns, not speak down to me as if I were a criminal.  Understanding I was getting nowhere I decided to hang up and try another agent.  Interestingly enough, each of five times I called back I got the same agent answering the phone.  There was a delay each time while I was on hold but the probability of getting the same agent each time should not be this high for a company with more than 2 agents.\r My advice, stay away from this company.  They are skimming"

Further, I read in NY tax website only if purchases are over 110 usd, online taxes are applicable, which was not the case in my case.when questioned further, they claim..go talk to state of NY - not to us.when questioned, for which states or countries, they do not charge tax..they say - do not try to beat the system..your card will get rejected. what a joke!!what a a great way to collect money ( in name of taxes) on a failing business model in modern times of WhatsApp, fb messenger, telegram, Viber etc.Be careful guys."

I have called Pingo at least five times to get this resolved, and sent numerous emails.  Their response is always the same - wait two hours and try again.  I finally had enough over the Thanksgiving weekend, called Customer Service, and told them to cancel the account because I was unable to use it.  I had $15 remaining on the account, and asked if this would be refunded to my account.  The woman told me yes, since I couldn't use the account.  When I contacted them (by email) yesterday to find out where my money was, I was told that it would not be refunded.  I am so upset about this, and would like to know what I should do next.  I do have contact information for IBasis, the company that owns Pingo, but I don't know if there is any point in writing to them.

          "Contenu": "I purchased this card because I needed to make quite a few calls to potential clients in a foreign country. Thankfully, I signed for their $5 package and not the $20 one (which promised $10 extra). One thing, the price that they prominently advertise is for the Softphone and not the toll free number - on toll free it is as expensive as calling through my carrier. I didn't realize it the first time I called. \r There are several problems with Pingo:\r 1. The softphone is extremely bad - half the people I called couldn't even hear me. So I tested it out by calling my own number - I heard loud creaking noises and my own voice was drowned in all the noise. I understand why my clients couldn't hear me. \r 2. You would expect that the toll-free number - for the price they charge - would be better. But no - when you call the number, you are asked to enter your ID and Pin. But half the time the system does not even realize that I have entered the code and keeps repeating its line to enter the ID. \r It's a complete waste of money. I have a few cents left in Pingo. But I would rather call my other clients with another system rather than ruin my relationship by using this one. \r Anyway on the plus side - their customer support is good. No complaints with that.\r UPDATE:\r I got a call from Brian Hawkins who is the Internet marketing manager at Pingo. While I could not attend the call, he further followed with me up over email to understand the issues faced by me. Their customer support has been awesome and Pingo has decided to refund the $5 back to me. Appreciate the company's customer experience. I have hence decided to upgrade the rating to 3 stars to reflect the update."

They do offer great call quality and service regarding phonecalls internationally especially to my home country from the US. However beginning this year anytime i recharge my account,it always says my account is under review and i either have to call and harass customer service before my recharge goes through; a total waste of time given that there is a big time difference between my call destination and US ,so sometimes,by the time the whole mess is resolved,it would be so late i can't make my call. I do not know why they started doing this but when i call customer service they tell me something silly that i recharge my account too often ,which i thought it would be good business for them or i don't know if this is their way for pushing me to sign up for Autorefill which i wont sign up for. Either way i am truly displeased with the service and the hassle i have to go through to make one phone call because i can't keep calling or e-mailing their customer service each time i recharge! Maybe they do not want my business and want me to look for another phone card!"

Great price, great call quality, smiles all around. $10 bonus credit was applied to the account as advertised, more smiles! 2/21/13 my daughter calls me using a borrowed phone card to tell me Pingo stopped working. I went to visit her on the 23rd and we tried together and it was like I had no account. Checked my email and they's sent an email saying they were sorry I'd canceled. I never cancelled, the credit card is fine, and nothing anywhere to let me know why. C.S. rep I talked to was not helpful, saying I had to email pingoverification for help. Four emails and zero replies, and my daughter still can't call home. They tried calling my daughter at the location she is staying, but she is not allowed calls from non-family members and has nothing whatsoever to do with opening or paying for the account. They've never even tried to call the number associated with my account (my mobile number.) From very satisfied to completely dismissed, worst customer service I've ever received! ASFAIK no refund of remaining balance either...\rUPDATE: forgot to mention I referred another customer who also opened an account!\r UPDATE 2/28/13: Pingo finally called me at the number associated with my account after reading my review here, thank you TrustPilot! After explaining the situation the account was restored in full, smiles again. My daughter called me using Pingo today and was very happy it was working again. I did tell the rep that if they cancel an account because they're suspicious the credit card number may have been stolen (apparent reason they cancelled) they should try to let the customer know there's a problem instead of sending an email saying \"sorry you cancelled.\" The phone service itself is excellent, but my student workers could give them a lesson in etiquette for customer service. The gentlemen I spoke with this morning was very polite, and my problem was resolved to my satisfaction, but he was unable to explain the failure to notify me the reason for cancellation, nor the lack of replies to my emails. Bumping from 1 to 3 stars, will bump again assuming no further problems. Suggestions: communicate directly when there's any hint of a problem with a customers card, (calling the number making the calls may not connect you to the account holder) allow reps on your toll-free number access to escalate to someone who can actually help, and lastly, a courtesy bonus credit to my account would have been appreciated after your communication issues basically cut-off communication for my daughter. I can be a very loyal customer, given the right circumstances..."

I've used other internet calling card services but switched over to PINGO (because the rates were better) and haven't regretted doing so one bit.  I highly recommend setting up an account to take advantage of good the great rates they offer.  I'm a happy customer and just took advantage of a Mother's Day Sale they just offered which will amount to even more cost savings for me when I call my family overseas."

I even get emails from them offering 'specials' of 15%-25% which I take advantage of.  I prefer to spend pennies for minutes than a large sum at the end of the month with AT&T.  Most of the time, I use their toll free number, enter my account number, password, dial the 1 and 10 digit phone number of the person I'm calling and then press pound.  Call goes right through.  When I'm calling from home, my account and password are already recognized so I just dial the number I want."

So, anyways, here is my Pingo story:\rI am in US since 2004 with close ties to India. Between 2004 and 2006, I must have tried at least 20 different calling cards and services for my calling needs to India. In 2006, I needed to call a European country where my fiancee moved at that time. Since my calling service from Reliance did not provide calling to countries other than India, I googled for calling cards and that's how I was introduced to Pingo. Long distance relations are difficult and I must say that cheap, and more importantly, absolutely reliable and convenient calling via Pingo did play a role in our relation. We got married and now are both in US and in the past 4 years we have used Pingo for all our international calling needs and we are absolutely satisfied by it. Thanks Pingo!"

This charge was not credited to our Pingo account, it simply was charged to us and disappeared into their system. No problem, \"Pingo is great\", we thought.\r Well,  we made three calls to them to correct this and no relief, they denied it.   So, I wrote a scathing review here and made a chargeback at the bank.  Then, because my review appeared here where they monitor, upper management called me and helped me analyze the problem.  Guess what?  It was our fault!  Our son's account had the wrong card attached to it and the charge came from my wife's card and showed up in another. \rAnyway, it was OUR FAULT, like many (can't say if all) of these Pingo complaints here seem to be. \rThanks Pingo team for fixing this.

I love the promotions that come every so often.\rToday, I sent an email enquiring about a special promotion. Instead of an email response, I received a phone call from Brian Hawkins. That was a clincher for me. Brian explained so much to me, followed with an email to make sure I understood everything he stated over the phone. This is it for me and my family, PINGO, and no other. Are you looking for a company that offers the best system to connect with your loved ones and friends? There's none other than PINGO. Very rare do people find great company in today's world, but when you do, shout it out. Brian, than you for the wonderful work you did today, and Pingo, thank you for having a reliable company that gives customers peace of mind>"
