I dont see how this is not specified on your website's terms, & conditions, or legal notices section.  Also dont claim global procurement I have been ordering supplies from the US for years and this woman gave me the worst experience ever."

I also do not have a land line telephone, having quit using it years ago and currently only use a cell phone. Those items disqualified me from being able to complete this initial order. They said any subsequent orders would be able to be sent to my PO Box, but since I couldn't verify my address over a land line at my physical address they could not send the initial order to me. Frustrating."

Supposedly because billing address didn't match shipping address, which is ridiculous as I do not live at my shipping address and a lot of people do not, this is normal. What's really creepy is when I called to ask why laptop never shipped I was conneted to lying, fraudulent employee, who lied to my face, he claimed that they called my phone number and someone there said they never ordered a laptop - it was a blatant lie, as the only person using my phone number is myself, they claimed they called landline for my phone, which it does NOT have. Filing with consumer affairs protection authorities. Bought 2 laptops from 2 large, well-known businesses instead at the same kind of price, received them promptly and without any issues, stay away from this horrendous dishonest company."

This company is UNRELIABLE and I would never consider ordering again from them. It's run as though they are still starting out selling online from 20 years ago.Updated 12/16/22. One can see the response from Connection is simply fictitious asking for an order # to look so they can look into. The ORDER # WAS MENTIONED IN THE REVIEW! Connection also made the order disappear from my account. The action of this company is similar to those fly-by-night companies."

So I emailed them from both my school .edu address and my work address. Then they said neither one was enough, but didn't explain how, and stated I would be required to use a wire transfer at my own expense! I offered to take a photo with myself and the credit card, or I could even take a photo of my mail, but they never responded. I haven't had this issue with CDW, so I guess I will have to go with them. You can see other reviews complaining about this, and they reply to claim this is for \"security\" despite the fact that we have all made similar purchases or larger at other places and never had this issue. Edit: It's been several weeks, so not sure what their internal review showed (if they even actually had one), but I never heard anything."

I will not use EVER again.Rec reply Sometimes, our automated shipping process ships faster than our customer service can get replies, which enables us to have such a fast shipping time..Maybe not leaving an email as a way to cancel? Instead, just a Phone number to call only if this is the case????"

I e-mailed customer care with information including the Massachusetts sales tax holiday FAQ showing that sales tax for my purchase was not due, but there has been no response after several days. If there is still no response soon, I will need to file a credit card dispute to get the sales tax refunded, which is a hassle on what should be a simple purchase.Update: I received a quick resolution shortly after this review."

Shipping was free, which is particularly amazing based on how great the shipping was!  The item, in its own strapped thick box, was packed inside of a comically large double-wall corrugated shipping box with a huge amount of air bags to ensure that the item arrived in perfect condition!  Shipping was also VERY fast!The entire experience was great.  I called them because their web site read, \"Limited quantities.  Call for next available shipment\".  I called the next day, and reached an actual person right away.  She confirmed that four were in stock, and could ship immediately.  Service was superb!I'm a customer for life based on this excellent experience!"
