When doing so, online system accepts all data but does NOT provide any button to complete order.  Customer Service advises only, \"clear cookies and cache and try again\" - did so and doesn't work!  Has happened to me three times in two months.2) Online process to debit partial $$ from gift-cards doesn't work - I have two gift cards whose $$ remaining after debit is higher than their ORIGINAL $$ value; two others where I know they have partial $$ remaining but online system claims value zero.3) Customer Service response to my phone complaint was stereotype; no matter how I complained, response was \"Clear cookies and cache and try again\".  When I stated that competitors provide FAR better customer service, I was invited to buy from competitor!  Customer Service doesn't appear to care about Sporty's reputation among my pilot community.4.  I have found that MyPilotStore has equally good product-line at lower cost, lower shipping costs, no online-system malfunctions, and VERY responsive Customer Service; in short, FAR better than Sporty's!My only reason to buy from Sporty's is $700+ of gift-card $$ locked into Sporty's online system.  I wish Sporty's would wake up to the fact that this company's attitude to customers and online-system reliability is rapidly undermining its historical position at top of pilot-supply online-order competitive environment."

Learning to fly is expensive and you could offer a little more value on your site."

VERY FRUSTRATING. Impossible to login and buy a gift for another person. You could mark something as a gift, but no where did it ask for name and address of gift receiver for online classes. I was dumbstruck by the lack of info anyone on the other end of the phone could answer. Still have no idea when the \"gift notification\" will mail, and I can only guess it will come to me instead of the intended person since the web site NEVER ASKED who the gift was for. simply awful. It's almost 2022, update your website please."

I\u2019m also not pleased that Sportys doesn\u2019t accept American Express.  Neither seems like a customer focus.  Perhaps a profit focus despite customer satisfaction impact.  I do think the course I ordered will be good\u2014it had strong reviews."

The best courses sold by Sporty's were Glen Endsley's courses.  This course is not Glen Endsley's series.  It is lacking in so many ways.  I am only on Section 1, but it is cumbersome to get through, no written materials come with it and frankly, for the premium price, this UAS course is nothing near the quality of instruction that I have come to expect from Sporty's Pilot Shop.

I have had excellent service from one of your competitors (who had the headset in stock) when ordering headsets, but decided to give you a try because of your 60 day return policy as theirs is only a 30 day return policy.

Also I always see a promo code box to fill in but I have never ever seen or been given a promo code for a discount. When I called Sportys CS today to ask about getting free shipping for my purchase they informed me that if I paid an annual membership fee I could then receive free shipping. I think that sportys is getting a little greedy with regards to requiring this fee. High dollar item or dedicated repeat customers should be getting a break on shipping IMO. I am now going to start weighing ALL my options from now on for my aviation needs. Sorry Sportys, you really let me down today."

The lady was very rude and said I could only send it back which I told her I was unable to do due to the fact I cannot drive to get it to the post office. All she could suggest was that I order the correct one and I had already spent almost 30 dollars on the wrong one and was certainly not going to send money again for them to possibly send the wrong item again. Do they not know the items that work with their products?. She was not very friendly or helpful in any way and I would never after this recommend sporty\u2019s to anyone at all because of poor customer service and unwillingness to help when they sent the wrong item. I did not order a 230V adapter."

          "Contenu": "I purchased the Crosswind gear bag recently and I have to say I am very disappointed with the purchase. I really wanted to love this bag but I don't. Its just not a good quality bag in my opinion. Maybe a $20-$30 bag but certainly not a $70 bag. Not even close! The bottom is very weak and there is no support. Whatever you put in the main compartment causes the bag to sag in the middle. Causing the rest of the bag to lose shape and kinda fold up.The headset compartment is difficult. The shoulder strap connection is literally directly over the zipper area. So you have to pull it out of the way every time you remove and replace the headset Design flaw making it annoying. The 2 slash pockets on the outside back are on the same side of the bag as the gear mod felt inside the bag. This side of the bag, the wallop the bag is very flimsy and weak causing the slash pockets to stay hanging open and sagging. Anything in left in these pockets are not secure. There goes the peace of mind that my gear is secure. I would never use those pockets for that reason. The shoulder strap is very cheaply made. No adjustable padding as it is actually sewn in place and is very cheap feeling. Overall this bag just feels weak and cheap. What I would expect from a $20 bag from Walmart but certainly not what I expected from a $70 bag, with the\"embroidery\", from an aviation supplier like Sporty's. Big mistake I made by getting the custom embroidery because now Im stuck with a bag with my name on it that I will not be using."

While they do carry a very well curated selection of aviation products, they tend to be my last resort due to the issues above. These days, a customer expects a return label and a painless process if they want to make a return. And if I'm spending several hundred dollars, a $10 shipping fee is just a slap in the face. They don't accept Amex, but you can check out with Paypal using your Amex."

Shipping is just over $9.00 - to get it a couple of states over, USPS. Seems high to me. The other thing I wonder about is the amount of marketing email that comes with each purchase. Hey, I want them to be successful too, but my inbox gets a bit crowded with Sporty\u2019s stuff. Yep - I can opt out - which is easy enough, but it seems like a lot of marketing. I\u2019d buy more if shipping was more reasonable - just sayin\u2019."

When I did a search on your web site your \"Forever Sectional Plotter\" popped up.  Believing it was the same, I ordered it.  There is a huge difference between the two; 1) the SP-4 is only 8 3/4\" long and fits in one's shirt pocket; 2) the scales (both nautical and statute) are completely different (being a x2 variation)."

I am a member of the ship club which offers free two day shipping on my orders. After placing the order and selecting the free shipping option, I was subsequently notified that the free two day shipping did not apply to Hawaii and Alaska. I\u2019m fine with that and understand the reason but I maintain that when you select Hawaii or Alaska in the shipping address the website should eliminate the free two day shipping option. Sporty\u2019s is better than that and can provide better Customer service in this regard. Please fix the website! I was initially notified that I would need to cancel the order and start over. I was not very happy about that. Thankfully, a Supervisor  got involved and just adjusted the shipping charge for me."

Makes them difficult to mount and stay with attachment of the suction plugs to the outer rims only. Obviously, nobody checks that sort of issue!The Four Color Flashlight seems functional enough but came without a Lanyard or a Sheath.I assume a sheath would aid in keeping the \"turn on buttons\" from turning on by themselves, unwanted, which has now happened to me twice, unknowingly. The two light unit comes with lanyard and sheath, couldn't this unit also?

I am disappointed this time.After having a conversation with Sporty\u2019 customer service manager the problem was resolved and I will receive a replacement order sent to the correct address. This is the right thing to do to fix their mistake. Thank you Sporty\u2019s. Now I would like to change my grading of you to five stars and will continue to do business with you. Mistakes will happen but we must fix them ourselves and not pass on the problems they create to someone else to fix"
