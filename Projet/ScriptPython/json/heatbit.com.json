Tried every fix that their customer service suggested. Tried to make it work for 2 months with their CS telling me to do this and try that. Nothing worked. This product is junk. The CEO is a fake and a lying chump. Their customer service is inept. Don\u2019t waste ur money on this crappy product."

Concerning issue is I\u2019m not getting any updates and no one has bothered to reply to my questions about where my unit is. I\u2019ve sent messages to their FB site and the support team via email. Disappointing as it sounds like a great product and I liked the website. So far the customer experience has been non existent. Not sure if I\u2019ll ever see my product. We\u2019ll see. Going to give it another week or two and then contest the charge and contact the better business bureau I guess."

If you talk to the CEO Alex, he basically tells you to eatsh1t\u2026not my problem. Do you want the full story and details, just get in touch with me and I will spill all. But basically, I gave this company $950 as an early investor and adopter. High hopes for Heatbit dwindled away. Two years of delays and finally got a unit. Was so excited and\u2026it didn\u2019t work. I contacted their customer service no less than 20 times. They had me try all sorts of reinstalls, power cycles, test flights, etc. I spent at least 12 hours trying to make this work\u2026and nothing. The product is pure CRAP.  Stay away. Heatbit is a scam and the CEO is chief scammer. I have all the emails from Heatbit CS and CEO Alex and will gladly share them with people in the media who want to write about it. So what did they do? They asked me to ship back the unit, no replacement unit, no free unit, with no compensation to me for all my lost time and effort, etc. What a terrible product and they don\u2019t back it up. STAY AWAY from Heatsh1t."

          "Contenu": "The concept is absolutely brilliant, the execution however is 'lackluster'. As far as a heater goes, unless you can log into the Heatbit system, the heater unusable and is nothing more than a small tabletop. In other words, the heating function is not available if you can't log in to the Heatbit wifi. I understand bugs and other issues, but this is unacceptable performance. After multiple, 15+ support requests, there has been no resolution. I lost track of how many times I have had to delete the app and reload it trying to get the appliance to function. I have tried to activate my warranty, but there is apparently some 'secret' steps I must take before that happens. I just don't know what they are, and they won't tell me either. I've even said 'Please' with no effect. If I had to do it all over again, I would PASS on purchasing the appliance and wait for the Mk2  version. Again, a truly revolutionary concept accompanied by insufficient support. Still waiting for some type of warranty resolution, but not holding much optimism."

I think there was a bit of Ready, Fire, Aim for the initial launch however. Customer service is all but non existent in/ on the app. There is Support via email, but the turn around time is about 24 hours or more. Email customer support has a habit of merging ALL requests into one gigantic email string making the fixing of individual concerns all but impossible.There could be a bit more instruction on the use and trouble shooting included with the unit, or available online. For instance when you push the power button < than 1 second the button dims and nothing else occurs that I can see. It would be helpful to inform the user what is actually occurring. If you push the button longer than 1 second but less than 4 seconds, something else occurs. The only reason I found these things out was from a service request to CS. This could all be easily avoided with a more robust user manual greater than a single postcard with instructions printed on one side. Bottom line is if you gave just a bit more information to your customers, your customer support would not be so busy. Great idea, not so great of an  execution initially. I trust they will fix the bugs."

They are responsive in the help function of the app. I have asked questions several times and have received friendly helpful guidance each time."

Main issue so far has been connectivity issues after firmware updates and having to manually resync my heatbit to the app. But that will pass I'm sure. As far as performance, it was perfect for this past winter being in the north east. Only gripe is the remote feature in the app to cycle through power modes was initially to be rolled out in February 2023. Once that is up and running, it will be even more convenient to use. I would recommend for those who want a more realistic price entry into Bitcoin mining."

If I'm paying for electricity to run through wires and make heat, I might as well earn bitcoin at the same time.I expect I'll be very happy; but only one concern after reading reviews.  Some customers waited months to get their order.  If mine arrives after in March, that will not make me happy.  Are shipments still months behind?.... It looks like they are unable to ship my order.  It is one thing to have weeks of delay for a bitcoin miner, but I need the heat.  Lowering by one star and asking for a refund.  Stay tuned..Update 12/28: The heater shipped yesterday and should arrive tommorow.  Really not too bad considering the holidays.Excited again..12/29 Heatbit installed and running.  So far today $0.07 earned at the current exchange rate.  More importantly it is providing needed heat in a cold area (near our dogs pet door).  The bitcoin is just a bonus.  Additional benefit is talking with kids about energy and how it isn't destroyed but all converted to heat.  Naturally they pointed out the led (light) and fan (motion).Disappointed again:The rating roller-coaster continues (5 stars to 1 star).  The heater worked for about one month and stopped just before I was to get my first bitcoin payout.  I have received no useful assistance from the company in getting it working again and there are no manuals or guides online.  It is so disappointing that a product that could be so cool, is a let down because of bad execution.  I can't imagine this company surviving.  Maybe someone else will try later.  I suspect Heatbit is IBM Simon (Google it) not iPhone.  Now I just hope to salvage some of my investment.REPLY TO HEATBIT: I've emailed support and so far (many days) they haven't offered anything that has helped.  They keep suggesting that they will fix it remotely.  That would be impressive as I can tell from my wifi router it isn't connected to the internet.UPDATE:  Replacement unit has arrived!  Back up to four stars."

I must say, I am favorably impressed with its performance.The idea of combining home heating with Bitcoin mining is indeed innovative. The heat it provides is ample and comforting. As someone who's mildly interested in cryptocurrency, the idea of mining Bitcoin while simply heating my room seems almost too good to be true. It's a pleasant bonus, though I would advise potential buyers not to expect to get rich overnight. Nonetheless, it does offset some of the electricity costs, which is a sensible feature I've not seen in other heaters."

          "Contenu": "LOVE HEATBIT!  Excellent product, exactly as described including easy set up, effortless use, warm, quiet, consistent minting with high TH/s.  I'm able to observe status and control device away from home using the app. Sleek.  The Heatbit team is fast to respond to questions, highly capable and very thorough.  The device was fully operational on delivery; the delivery was classy, really well packaged, and arrived fast after shipping was announced.  The setup was simple, effortless; plug in, power on, pair with app, enable wifi, start heating/mining bitcoin.  I had inexplicable failure of the app display five days into use; I wrote the team, the solution was fast, personal, and effective.  The heater is exactly as promised.  I am buying another for me, and intend to give as gifts this Christmas.  Thank you Heatbit, you are incredible.  Areas for improvement.  There is precious little information about this product.  The YouTube channel is empty.  My web searches reveal only dialogue in reddit comments; as this is a burgeoning project, this doesn't surprise or concern me.  There is \"FUD\" from tech pros describing this as overpriced, low yield; these critics direct me to explore home asic mining, which leads to questions of need for significant space, airflow, noise control, electrical hard-wiring, and fire precautions...Heatbit appeals to me because I am paying to heat my home, and this is the only plug-and-mint heater I've seen--Simple, effective, financially rewarding.  Heatbit will do well to promote customers are gaining any amount of bitcoin from energy otherwise lost to the single purpose of creating heat.  I'm pleased to be contributing to the network security by adding hashrate. The Heatbit is sealed, no easy access points to components, indicating to me, stay out.  There is no discussion of maintenance--vacuuming, cleaning vents, troubleshooting internal components; I'm unaware if performance component upgrades are possible, or is this a single use item?  I am very happy to use this product.  I will buy more of them.  The Heatbit team is excellent in responsiveness to inquiries, very good design, ease of use.  Highly recommend Heatbit."
