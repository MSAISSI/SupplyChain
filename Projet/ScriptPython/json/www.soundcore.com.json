          "Contenu": "I bought the Soundcore VR P10 in summer on sale and was quite happy with them, but I lost the charging case this week. I got in contact with their support and they told me they do not offer any charging cases for my earpods and now I am forced to buy new ones. But I rather buy from a different company because, then I at least know that they would offer me solutions regarding needed accessoirs etc. I advice you to other brands."

          "Contenu": "I purchased some soundcore life A1 earbuds from Amazon in March 22. This week (20.11.23) I found the left earbud would not charge, the contact on the earbud had corroded.I contacted Amazon who advised me that the product has a 3 year warranty and I should initially contact Soundcore.I contacted Soundcore, sent a copy of my receipt, a photo of the corroded connection on the earbud. To my amazement Soundcore have refused to accept responsibility and are totally ignoring the 3 year warranty. Luckily Amazon have stepped up and once the earbuds are returned to Amazon they are going to issue a full refund.Hang your head in shame Soundcore."

Info is misleading, initially informing shipping will be refunded later stating this is not the case. Other than poor quality design, sound has been average at best. Should have stuck to my favourite brand (sony), you get what you pay for."

Anything defective happens after 3 months you get a secondhand replacement, we are talking earphones here. Soundcore prefer to call them \"renewed\" & carefully checked...mmm, we all know what they mean. SECONDHAND.My P3's stopped working on one side and were exchanged, 6 months later the exact same fault occurred so I contacted again, this time... awww too late the warranties up, so I'm left with 2 duff sets now.The irritating thing with the P3's is they know there are issues with one side ceasing to work and or not holding charge but still sell the earbuds knowing full well that they can just send out more \"renewed\" junk then a few months later the problem just comes back and hey ho you're outa warranty. What a way do business.He then offered me 20% off some more thinking I'm stupid enough to buy anything else from Anker.Avoid them and their awful warranty rules. My advice stick to a reliable brand like Samsung or Sony."

I notified Soundcore with the problem and was given this response:\"Thanks for contacting us and letting us know your issue. We are so sorry to know the speaker stopped charging correctly. Based on your description, it seems like the issue is with the deivce.I'm very sorry to say the order you sent us expired its 18-month warranty in Novermber, 2022, so, unfortunately, it is not possible to exchange or refund it. If your defective item might be from a different order made within the past 18 months, please let me know so I can process the warranty claim.Know that we register all defects and evaluate them statistically.  These statistics enable us to identify increased defect rates or concentrated product issues, so thank you for letting us know about this.We sincerely apologize for these circumstances and wish you all the best in the future.\"So they've admitted the issue is with the device. But what they're really telling me is that we sold you a lemon and you need to suck it. Keep in mind I have used this speaker no more than 10 times and have only recharged it twice. Now I'm left with a $100 paperweight. Not a good value.The response from Anker to my review advised me to contact them about the problem and that they would be willing to help me. I contacted them and they told me they could not help me. I\u2019m still stuck with a $100 paperweight."

The Soundcore Sleep A10 earphones are nothing like what is described on the website. Every little external sound is not only audible but seems to be magnified!I even tried different settings and adjustments, hoping that I might have missed something, but to no avail. The simple foam earplugs I had been using previously proved to be much more effective.I feel utterly misled by the claims made by Anker. This product has not only failed to fulfill its basic promise, but it has also added to my frustration during a time when I needed support the most. I cannot in good faith recommend these earphones to anyone looking for a noise-blocking solution.It's back to the drawing board for me, and a lesson learned to be more skeptical of over-hyped products."

Now Soundcore said the delivery firm will only issue refunds after 10 days have elapsed after the due delivery date.Then Soundcore said they will issue a full refund if nothing arrives by the 19th....16 days after placing my order. So, the 19th arrived and Soundcore said a full refund will arrive in 3 to 5 days. A full 11 days later....NO REFUND!!

My fault for not checking the billing address right away but no where on my check out did it show the address their system had pulled from google. Now my item has been shipped to the wrong address and they are unwilling to provide a refund. I even contacted them while it was still in their warehouse and they refused to adjust the address. Use amazon please if you are going to get their products but going forward I will no longer be getting anything from them, an error on their end should be remedied by them, this is god awful customer service.

I reply, yes, to the courier's depot. Read the words at the top stating 'undeliverable.' The address is correct. UPS, DPD and the postman have no problems. Indeed, our postcode applies to only three houses and will usually bring you to our door. (Incidentally, why don't couriers ask someone if they are having difficulties finding an address? We are rural and within in two miles of us, any other house would put them right). Finally, I gave the alternative address of our local butcher in our village for another try. Yesterday, 31st August, I had to drive the three miles to collect my package. I had asked customer services to mark the package for my attention. Did they? Did they heck; not even my name! They did offer me a ten per cent discount on a future purchase but it really is not worth the hassle."

But at one point one of the speaker started to switch off in every 5 minutes, or lost the connection. The service didn't repair that but refunded the money. That's ok! Let buy a a Liberty Air 2 Pro. I can say as an initial point than in case of the Air 2 but the dark clouds came quiet quick. After a few months usage one of the speaker makes beepy sound over 70% volume in case of every Mid and Treble sounds, impossible to use. And the other one makes much lower volume than the other. Okay, back to the service, it has been repaired. I got back and the right speaker volume is around 50% of the left one so when I am listening it seems that it has no sound. I understood that is not a high-end product but seriously, it's something like a cabaret or a Chaplin movie, you could smile on that but in general you would cry."

They have requested a second email address to verify the payment which makes absolutely no sense. It's the most bizarre purchasing process I've ever encountered and given I'd like a pair of headphones sooner rather than later I'll be taking my business else where.It's a shame because anker products are normally very good"

They then said they have no access to stock levels and again told me to email.In the meantime, I have no headphones, no response, and they still have \u00a3120 of my money.Not recommended.  I'm sure the product is great given the reviews I've seen, but I'll open a dispute with PayPal and never buy from them again, as I wouldn't trust their warranty process if anything went wrong.EDIT - I'm sure Anker will add their stock response to this review saying \"email us\".I have, twice.

They are supposed to be a Christmas present but, even though they have had my money for more than two weeks now, I have not received any update whatsoever.

At the very least I would have liked there to be an acknowledgement that I already paid and I would also very much like there to be an estimate of when I can expect my order to arrive.I'm not sure what to do at this point.. I need those earbuds for Christmas but it seems that my order is either in a state of limbo or Anker just doesn't care to process their orders in a timely manner. I wouldn't even care about stuff taking a bit longer if they would at least be open about it and let me know but the way things are currently handled is not acceptable. I tried asking for an update through the mail but they don't seem to respond to those so that doesn't get me anywhere either. I might just have to cancel and try to get some other earbuds in time for christmas. My advice for those that are reading; do not order anything from Soundcore by Anker if you need something in a timely manner and care about knowing what's up with your order."

          "Contenu": "Horrible customer service.Around the end of August last year, I decided to buy a pair of earbuds, and a pair of \"Liberty Air Soundcore 1\" were at a discount of 50\u20ac on PCdiga (Portuguese Retailer), so I bought them.After 2 months of using them, the earbuds suddenly stopped working, because the right side earbud was overheating when I put it in the charging case.I had never dropped them and always took care of them. Also, I didn't use them a lot, I only used them around 3-4 days a week, for 4-5 hours a day. I only charged them once per day (and some days I didn't even charge them, they were just kept in the case).So, of course, I emailed the retailer, but they said that they couldn't do anything and that I should contact soundcore, and that's what I did, I emailed soundcore asking for help, and at first, they said that they would be able to resolve my problem, even though I had bought the product from a retailer.Fast forward to 9 months later, 19 emails later, and a lot of waiting for their responses (sometimes they didn't even respond to me and I had to email them back again, after weeks or months), and my problem is still not resolved because soundcore told me (in their last email) they couldn't do anything because I had bought the product from a retailer, something that they assured me wasn't a problem 9 months earlier (and yes, the product is still in the 2-year warranty period).Now I have a pair of earbuds that are malfunctioning and 50 euros wasted.And by the way, they told me 3 times over the course of 9 months that: \"A technical team would email me to help me resolve my issue\". After I complained 3 different times that they did not email me, they told me that they can't help me.If soundcore decides to email me back and finally help me by resolving the issue (which let me remind you, was not my fault, the product started overheating out of nowhere after only using it for 2 months, this is obviously due to a problem with the product itself) then I would be more than happy to change my review back to a better grading.Extremely disappointed and angry."

For some reason the usb charging cable was in the case with the headphones and pressed against one of the cushions which punctured it and looks pretty bad. I contacted customer support to get new cushions, but I could only get 10% discount or send it back. Since I do like the headphones and think it's a bit ridiculous to sent it back for a cushion that is replaceable, I asked again but I got the same reply. So I decided to escalate the issue to a manager and answer was the same, 10% discount or send back since they don't have the cushions I was told. To me it's pretty weird the cushions can be bought on the US and UK website, but not EU. Furthermore it's restricted to US and UK citizens, so if you live in EU and need new cushions, you can't get them.So with back against the wall I had to make a choice, send it back for a damaged cushion, a part you replace after a year anyways, or take the discount. I decided to go for the discount and buy cushions on UK website, didn't know then that it's region restricted, found that out with ordering. So now have a damaged cushion on a \"new\" pair of headphones and can't buy replacement cushions.Pretty weird in my opinion customer service can't help with spare parts and parts are region bound."

After about 4 months, one of the buds stopped working (I went back to my wired ear phones.) In the UK to I thought I would try to get a replacement earphone or get faulty one fixed  Soundcore made it awkward. A week later I was using the one good ear bud in a field. It fell out in long grass, totally disappearing. I went home and threw the rest of the Soundcore stuff away.(date of experience) Just appalling. I have bought an Oppo pair now. They don't fall out. If your Soundcore buds dont fall out or break, the sound is ok, but for me buying the product is a big regret, and attitude of customer service while understandable from their point of view (yep, could have tried to replaced in TW), means that I won't be buying from this brand again.  I read the reply. A bit empty in my opinion. I DIDN'T get the response I was hoping for (BEFORE losing the one good Earbud). Also, not quite sure what paperwork I have in Taiwan. The main point stands, expensive purchase is basically useless after ~4 months. I am currently wearing my WIRED Sennheiser phones, still going strong after ~4 years."

But to make things worse if you turn up the volume more than 80% they F**t constantly even listening to folk music and they also have this awful clipping effect dipping the volume as soon as any bass comes in.They also do not fold up very well or fit the supplied case very well and the battery life is at best 3 hours for me on fully volume. Good things are they are nice sunglasses but I would only except to pay more than around \u00a330 for them and they are very good as for phone calls, being very clear both ways. I will be returning mine as I do not feel they are worth no way near the asking price."

          "Contenu": "This review is specifically for the Q30 Life Headphones:I originally rated my review at 5 stars as after downloading the Soundcore App to gain access to the multiple equaliser settings (which you have to do or the sound is flat).  The Equaliser provides loads of presets and this worked a treat - uploading the profile direct to the headphones via Bluetooth.Everything was going fine for a week, and the ANC noise cancelling function worked very well too.1 week later I was shocked and annoyed to find that when I came to use the headphones with the AUX cable supplied on some of my other devices like my PC or my soundbar - the headphones cancel both the equaliser settings and the Noise Cancelling Functions!In other words the headphones revert to a flat horrible sound like you are inside a tin can.  There is nothing you can do about it and the ANC button changes to a pause and play button!This is totally underhanded and what is worse is that Soundcore / Anker make no mention of this on their Amazon product web page.  So they have crippled two of the core and primary functions without telling you prior to purchase.So if you are on an aircraft or have no compatible bluetooth device, you cannot effectively use these headphones as the sound is unbearably poor quality without the equaliser functionality and you can forget any noise cancellation functionality.The fact that Soundcore omitted to  make this fact know to buyers has really ticked me off.  However, if you buy their more expensive Q35 headphones, these functions are miraculously restored...  From research I have done, it seems that early models of the Q30 did have these features enabled with the wired AUX connection, but a firmware update has now disabled it and anyone buying a new pair like I had just done a week ago will already have this later firmware preinstalled so there is nothing you can do.I sent mine back to Amazon on the basis that these were sold not as described.  Soundcore should come clean with their customers and clearly state that the Equaliser and ANC functionality ONLY works if connected via Bluetooth!  Then customers would have an informed choice.I am now looking for another set and will not be purchasing the far more expensive Q35s as I believe this is why they crippled the function to get people to buy the more expensive set that are almost identical in every other way, but do have the both these functions working in wired mode and bluetooth mode."

The problem is, when you take the earbuds from the charging case and try to connect to the phone, the earbuds don't switch on.  However,  if you keep the earbuds back on the charging case and reset them and try again...bingo. It works.  Obviously it's annoying.  Isn't it?  Having said that it doesn't happen all the time. I would say..3 or 4 out of 10 times.Sound quality is good. Noise cancellation is effective."

          "Contenu": "For some reason it took longer than normal for the product to arrive, despite it was on stock and it was dispatched by Amazon (even though I order from Soundcore's website directly). I live in Linz (Austria) and normally an order from Amazon takes 3-4 days to deliver, from Soundcore's website it took 8 days. I was looking forward so much to get the product and when I received it, I figured out I had ordered the previous generation (Liberty Air). I thought they had sent the wrong product but I realised I made the mistake of ordering the wrong one. Unfortunately, when I filled the returning form I got to know I would need to pay for the shipment back, since it was my mistake. I got a little upset but accepted it, thinking it would cost me the normal 4-5 euros that most of companies charge for shipment. Shockingly, it costed me 14 Euros!! I paid 70 Euros for the earphones and just to send back I needed to pay 14!! At the end of the day, I was heavily penalised by my mistake, even though in present times most companies don't charge for returning items. Finally, because of this I am not going to order the Liberty Air 2 anymore, unfortunately. If I didn't need to pay this absurd in the shipment return, I would have placed a new order for the correct product. Bad for me, bad for Soundcore, nobody is happy. Good job!"

The noise cancelling is ok, slightly worse than what Space A40 has, but considering it's also cheaper than A40, it's not really a negative. The only thing I think is a pity is that there is no HearID support for these earbuds, so no customization for your hearing. The only reason why I give them 4/5*, otherwise they are perfect."

Great sound and directional awareness. Main problems I have is the metrical and joints in the headphones feels really cheap for \u00a350. Another small problem with them is that when using the active noise canceling i sound that turning your head would throw it off and make sounds but to be fair that is the same for all N,Cs I have tried. Over all they are great. Iver been being them for everyday use as well as in recording situations and found both to work nice. If anything should change it would be to make more of the product out of metal, that way it would feel more premium and would definitely be worth more."

I like the nosie reduction function, it doesnt eliminate every noise but I dont like to eliminate all external sounds anyway, however when its windy or there is some other outside noise, it does it job, I can hear what I listen to. The connection is very stable and has the maximum range that my phone allows, comparing the connection to that previously owned earbuds had, this is the best I have so far."

Not only they were quick to respond, they even CHASED me, to understand if the problem had been solved and to understand if the replacement was to my standard. I a still flabbergasted"

And moving along to Ankers Bluetooth headphones I own the Soundcore Life A2 NC,and again battery life and sound quality are still as good as I first bought them 2 years agoSo if you want to find out more regarding the above Anker Soundcore BT speakers & earbuds then watch my Tech channel @lets-talk-tech-uk as I've got some content of these (and possibly more) being aired very soon .. so don't forget to Subscribe so you don't miss out on the latest Technology and if it's good it's good and if it's bad then I'll let you know"

The only thing I would like to be better is the transparency mode, that has a lot of white noise and is louder than the real noise around you. A bit like if you were wearing a earing aid device. If I put them on at the gym, with loud music around, it is a bit stressful to my ears... must turn of transparency before the gym! Other than that, nothing else to complaint about. Very nice and detailed sound, comfortable to wear, good battery life and for me a very good overall product and better than others, much more expensive."

Better noise cancelling, way better microphone and call quality, surprisingly better connection stability with apple watch than AirPods, better ear placement and tighter grip for using during workouts."

I would really recommend them.Where Anker really shone was when a fault developed in the left earbud. I contacted Anker customer service, checked a few things and had a replacement pair within 4 days. I was expecting them in 10-14 days. Under promising and over delivering, that what I call great customer service. Praise when praise is due.Thanks for your great service and great products.Michael Mckee"

I did just that and I was within a day contacted by the support person, given all the details I needed regarding the return address closest to the place I live. I was under the impression that I'll get my money back when the package gets delivered to Anker, but they were kind enough to trust and provided a return before the package reached their return warehouse. For my recent Amazon return I got a refund after 2 weeks... I've recently been through 5 headphones, build quality wise Anker's were truly the best. If it wasn't for the way the ANC worked on a train ride I would gladly keep them over the Bose I ended up with keeping."
