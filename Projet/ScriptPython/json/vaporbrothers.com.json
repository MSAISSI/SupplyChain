I expected to get one identical to the whip it came with, and it was for the most part, however the screen was very light and easy to push through. During the first week of use, I had to remove the hose to set it back into place after accidentally pushing it through. Which isn\u2019t easy to do\u2014lots of twisting and pulling required. I went to discard the burnt remains, and the screen must\u2019ve fallen in the trash with it. In retrospect, I should paid the $4 for the extra screens. On one hand, I appreciate how the screens can be changed out with ease (they get dirty), on the other, it is way too easy to push it through. Hope they\u2019re able to resolve this, until then, just buy extra screens."

Loving the Sidekick so far, works great, easy to use, versatile, easy to clean (and you can clean the whole vapor path), has a bunch of included accessories, charges quickly and I love that it comes with an extra set of batteries.My one gripe is that the screw holding on the screen seems to have been tightened by the hand of god himself and despite following the instructions and even trying some WD-40 on it, it just will not budge. I can clean it by soaking the whole top lid in alcohol but I'm not sure how I'll be able to replace the screen down the line without replacing the entire lid. But I don't think that's on the seller, and my experience with them has been excellent! Would recommend."

Because I primarily vape with the VB-1 instead of smoking, I am still able to run long distances (5-6 miles) without getting winded, despite being in my later 40s. My first VB-1 lasted through 15 years of daily use...as in, leaving it on for 12 hours every day. About a decade in, I needed to order a replacement whip, and it cracked shortly after receipt. I wrote VB and they sent me a new whip free of charge. This kind of customer service turned me into a loyalist. I just ordered my second VB-1 and it works like a charm."

They reached out to the designers of the product looking for an answer and came back to me with one. That was all I needed to know to buy it. I received it very promptly! I trust the research they do into products before offering them on their site. I have been so satisfied with my OG vaporizer from them, and got loved ones into them too. It is good to have companies that really care about offering the best products for their users. It's cool to know they have as much love for the practice as I do, and they're looking out for us!"
