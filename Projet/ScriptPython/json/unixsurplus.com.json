I only noticed that these were sent separately when they arrived.Then I was informed of the second shipment number, here it was said that the package had been lost. (This can be believed that the recipient was there and that a claim was submitted).Since I don't come from America myself, I agreed that I would pay the transport costs for the replacement delivery (mind you, I already paid about $ 100 for the label i provided).Now this seller has passed the case on Ebay, which reimbursed me the amount even though I actually wanted to have a replacement delivery.I still wanted the ordered goods at the gennant price, but I should pay almost $100 more now.After the eBay case was closed, they no longer answer, but my price offers at the original purchase price can still be rejected.HANDS OFF!"

While they disabled shipping to Ukraine, they are suggesting using their direct shipping services. Additionally, I faced a lot of trouble because we (in Ukraine) have monthly payment limits on cards; as a result, I paid for the goods, exceeded my card limit, and got the orders canceled."

Customer service in regards to price matching their eBay shop for a bulk order was A+ as well. My only complaint is that it took a week for them to ship my order. Sure amazon has spoiled us all with fast shipping but c'mon 3 days tops Unix Surplus for an order that does not involve a whole server build (s) and testing. I ordered on an early Monday morning and the order shipped until Friday. According to the testing verification stickers on them, they were all tested on the same day so it does not appear that testing the drives is the culprit to this delay. Overall however, a definite positive experience and will definitely return for more."

However, one time I received a server that had a HBA card with a bad port. They made it right by sending out a replacement card.Also, they gave me a system with the correct amount of RAM. But when I tried to add more RAM sticks to it, it didn't work because one of the motherboard slots was dead. It ended up being ok because I put the new DIMMs in a non-standard slot, which worked. But just know that what the equipment is rated for in the posting may be its limit. Upgrading beyond that is not supported and the company will not automatically provide the results of their own internal test reports."

          "Contenu": "In testing the X9SRL-F, I thought the motherboard had bad PCIe slots. Unfortunately, I was not able to test every slot until after the 30 day return period.Still, I opened an RMA to see what could be done. There was no response, not even to say that the 30-day period had passed. This was caused by a misconfiguration of their website that sent the RMA request to the wrong place. For this, they get dinged one star.But, the motherboard was actually functional, which I determined after I got another X9SRL-F that showed the same symptoms. It turns out there is a very subtle bug which is only exposed if you:1. Have more than 2 PCIe cards installed.2. At least one of the PCIe cards is fairly modern (like an NVMe adapter) compared to the motherboard.3. Got unlucky with the reset of the CMOS.#3 is the key, where if you clear the CMOS, the default for Active State Power Management (ASPM) is \"Disabled\", but sometimes it doesn't quite take, and it is enabled, even though it shows as not. With ASPM enabled, the other two parts of the bug work together to make the motherboard extremely unreliable, and the slots farthest from the power supply (the x4 slots) are the most affected.The workaround for the bug is to enable ASPM, save and reset, then manually disable it and save and reset, which causes the setting to correctly disabled. I don't fault UNIXSurplus for not hitting this extremely rare bug when they test, plus it still doesn't mean the motherboard is truly bad."
