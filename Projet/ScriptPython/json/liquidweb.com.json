          "Contenu": "I strongly advise against using Liquid Web's Dedicated Server with fully managed support. This company seems to favor new customers, often neglecting existing ones. My experience reflects this, as my requests (Ticket: 13082580) have been consistently overlooked, even for simple tasks. The account managers, Nathan A. and Steven L. have demonstrated a lack of professionalism and responsiveness, failing to reply to emails and exhibiting arrogance. For nearly five months, I have been attempting to obtain a quote for migrating our server to a new one. However, the account managers appear more interested in extracting additional fees, leveraging the complexity of migrating my current server. Consequently, I am in the process of moving my dedicated server services to a different provider to avoid further interactions with these unscrupulous individuals. Iskan."

If I didn't know the right question to ask, they took advantage and did not educate me so I could make an informed choice. I did a lot of research but it was an area that was beyond my technical expertise. The migration was a nightmare but I hoped that it would get better once settled. Not hardly. They have a wonderful Tech Support team but they cannot change the short-comings in the server and lack of features, way less than what we moved from. The stress and problems this has caused is tremendous."

          "Contenu": "Liquid Web has singled us out, targeted us, and requested personal information that is not standard nor required, as stated in their public privacy policy.  We were looking for an alternative provider other than Godaddy, so we pre-paid LiquidWeb for a 3-year subscription to use a Virtual Private Server (VPS).  They told us that we were a fraud, refused to tell us why, and immediately mandated that we email them two government-issued identifications.  NOTE: Their request is not an industry standard to our knowledge with any other server hosting providers such as Godaddy.  They also have no public privacy policy to ensure safeguards for requesting and storing government identifications.  We asked if they could provide a secure encrypted way to send them two forms of ID, and they would not provide one.  So we offered to send them other forms of identification that are less sensitive in nature, and they rejected them.  They refused to tell us what precisely they are looking for in our two forms of government ID to make sure everything is correct when purchasing VPS services, which couldn't be accomplished by alternative methods.  Their public terms of service don't require any form of government ID from all of their new and existing customers.  NOTE: They are not a financial institution where requesting government identifications is part of KYC and industry standards.  We also never gave them permission to pull credit, etc.  We feel targeted, mistreated, and discriminated against.  They selectively created barriers to entry and mandates for us.  We have done them no wrong and provided all the standard information stated in their Privacy Policy under the Customers section.  We have all the email evidence to support this complaint."

The so called account representative even stopped responding to emails, hence we cancelled.Bottom line is they do not care for existing customers, all their efforts are placed into onboarding more unknowingly customers that will get white glove service on the way in, but no service after that.They will milk you for all the overpriced charges they can until you seek something better."

Can not give high enough praise re Alex's work ethic!"

No biggie, but they kept charging my card rather than just handling it internally. I had to voice this to them and get my refunds. I should have walked away at this point, but I gave them another chance and that was a mistake.When my account was activated, I was only able to log in once into InterWorx before it suddenly went down. Their support team kept saying someone new picked up the ticket and it was as if no one cared or knew what to do. My Interworx login has been down for the entire time. One support person flat out lied to me that the site was up, while the rest (including online websites to check to see if sites were down) confirmed that the site was still down.I've requested to cancel and have them issue me a refund, but they are not issuing me a refund.Everyone, PLEASE stay away.

          "Contenu": "We were using Liquidweb for server hosting for some time, then switched completely to AWS. We canceled in December 2022 through their online portal. For four more months they continued to charge us $175/mo. Once we realized what was happened, contacted them and they said that they were charging us for a firewall for a server we didn't have and they claimed we had not canceled everything and refused to refund it. They also said we had to cancel again, even though we had received the termination email 12/23/2022. We terminated everything visible in their portal, it didn't notify us that there was anything else, and when we went into the portal to review our account, it did not show anything active as a service so we couldn't even know there was something still \"active\" after termination. Their support even acknowledged IN WRITING that we could not have known there was a service we were still be charged for through their own portal. We reported all this to the credit card company, got a credit, and LiquidWeb just re-charged us for everything the credit card had credited back after they lost. Now we have to go through the whole dispute process with the credit card company again. This is beyond poor customer service to fraudulent behavior."

          "Contenu": "I purchased a managed dedicated server with CentOS and WHM/cPanel on a 50% off for the lifetime of the server Black Friday special. I have been a Liquid Web customer for more than twelve years, and this is my fourth server with them in this time.Six months later, the server could not be updated because CentOS 7 is the last version WHM/cPanel is going to support. cPanel 110.0 is the last version to support CentOS 7. The current version is now 114.0.8.This was announced by cPanel at least nine months before my purchase, so Liquid Web had to have known yet continued to sell servers with cPanel and an EOL operating system.I cannot update to benefit from new features in cPanel, and security will become an issue in less than a year when support for security patches is completely discontinued. This is on a box that would typically have a 5-6-year lifespan for someone like me.Liquid Web insists that I need to buy a new server to update the OS and refuses to carry my lifetime discount over to the new server. I am being financially punished for their mistake, and it's going to cost me thousands more than it should.This is in addition to the complete fiasco of getting this box set up. The wrong control panel was installed, so the whole server had to be reformatted, the box was not configured properly, and getting the billing right with the Black Friday discount took seven months of arguing back and forth with Liquid Web that this promotion had even existed. I have close to two dozen tickets dealing with the issues surrounding this server.The ticket I opened regarding this current problem is now well over two months old, and weeks pass by without any reply. This is despite having written to Liquid Web support through the chat several times to ask for someone to look at the open ticket. I had to open another ticket to bring attention to the existing ticket, and that ticket is now a month old and going nowhere.The Liquid Web sales team refuses to help, as they always do in situations like these. I have asked to speak to management several times, but my requests have been ignored.Needless to say, I am not a happy customer and I am once again considering leaving Liquid Web."

They suddenly snuck in a charge for almost $40 a month for something that is already included on my server. When I asked why that was being billed when it is already included, the response was that it was supposed to be included in my bundled package, but it was never installed, but now it has been set to $0.00 again on my invoice. This is the worst thing I have ever heard. They tell me that when I ordered this server, it was supposed to come with something, they didn't install it and then now they are still keeping it on the invoice, but they are kind enough to mark it as $0.00 because it wasn't installed and is still not installed. I think they are trying to bill customers for things so they can make more money. Go over your invoices people. Beware! I would recommend checking your invoices once a year when you do business with this place."

          "Contenu": "I worked with Liquid Web for more than 12 years hosting my website. However, the last two years were a disaster. They managed to bilk me out of $2,000+ by fraudulently double billing me. It all started when they were having problems with hosting my site and could not figure out what the issues were. Then they told me it was because my server was old and beyond useless and needed to be replaced. I gave them the ok and they created a new server. At the beginning of this process, which took about 3 weeks, I received a form type letter which outlined in technical jargon what they were planning to do. At the very end of the letter buried in the text they mentioned that that they needed to receive notice to discontinue any older server to avoid double billing. Because I did not see this line in the letter I did not know to tell them to discontinue my old server. They require having your credit card information and so they deduct their fees every month. So for two years they took money from my account for the server they determined was useless. I tried to resolve this with numerous staff there but they blew me off every time saying that they don't give refunds. Their staff were rude and cocky. They are very sneaky in their billing practices and I suggest to everyone to carefully review your bills. You may find similar issues if you do. I am giving them one star for the services that were provided successfully in my first 10 years with them."

We are forwarding documents to our attorney and anticipate a filing in our local Small Claims Court later this week. We will continue to update Trustpilot until this matter is resolved. 03/08/2023 We use Liquidweb cloud sites service. I feel they offer a quality product in terms of uptime and speed. However I have been frustrated by their Customer Service Department regarding the amount of our monthly invoices. The problem is that we have had two line items on our invoices for well over 5 years that apparently no one at the company could correctly explain. This week tech support finally gave us the answer- we have been paying for services on sites we are no longer even hosting. In 5 years we have been over charged by $4,440.00.These charges are for MSSQL storage and SSL certificates. Over the years we have questioned these line items, but we were never told they were for inactive websites. We were only told that they were necessary charges.On Jan 12, 2023 we opened up ticket number 11600106 to address possible overcharges. We were notified that only 1 person in the company handled potential cost reductions. Even though we have followed up at least 5 times, we have not heard a single word from this person.We are beginning to suspect that Liquidweb purposely overcharges clients.We placed a phone call to Liquidweb sales and got a new price quote for the services we are currently receiving. The quote for new service was issued in minutes. The prices on the new quote would save our company over $1700.00 a year.The purpose of this review is to finally get someone\u2019s attention at Liquidweb. We are willing to stay with them at a renegotiated price. Hopefully current and possible future Liquidweb clients can benefit from our story."

          "Contenu": "Always interesting reading and comparing the lower and higher ratings. Difficult to reconcile them as being from the same company.And upfront \u2013 I am not a Liquid Web customer. My engagements with Liquid Web are escalations related to a serial spammer Liquid Web provides DNS and hosting services to.This spammer is known as a solo-ads person \u2013 Dominykas Gobe ala \u201cDomas G\u201d. For context \u2013 Google still returns links to old offers that Dominykas was flogging on WarriorForum. Dominykas has ignored every unsubscribe request I submitted over the course of a year or so.Having now reached out to Liquid Web a few times over the last year with well-evidenced and well-supported escalations, I can report that these escalations were all met with stony silence, and no action on Liquid Web's part. I know this because I am still getting up to ten spam emails a day from across multiple services that Liquid Web hosts for Dominykas.In my mind, points to the lower ratings probably being more accurate than the higher ratings. Some of the stories around their focus on revenue generation ahead of service supports that narrative. I imagine their relatively recent sale to private equity is probably making this worse.Regardless, I am not the only person reporting Dominykas\u2019s spam emails to multiple spam reporting entities. And from what I am seeing, these reports are impacting deliverability.I imagine you want to give your online presence the best chance of success. You should be aware then that these deliverability impacts may potentially also affect your deliverability.Suggesting there are probably other providers you can find at the same or similar price points who will not carry equivalent risk. These providers may even deliver better service than the one- and two-star reviews here speak to because they can afford to pay service and support staff salaries instead of the private equity executive salaries that Liquid Web now also has to fund since Liquid Web sold themselves to a private equity fund.**Updated on 12-Oct-23.**Noting Liquid Web have asked for further details via Trustpilot - something like a reference number or email address. Otherwise TrustPilot will remove my review.I provided a reference to the email I sent to Liquid Web on 1-Aug 23 with the subject line,    \"Further abuse complaint Re: \"Abuse complaint | Serial spammer ignoring repeated unsubscribe requests over extended period (various, including domasg2.com, domsolo.com, domasg.com, and mailgobi.com)\".There was no response from Liquid Web to that email.That email included an earlier email sent on 17-Jun-23  with the subject line,    \"Abuse complaint | Serial spammer ignoring repeated unsubscribe requests over extended period (various, including domasg2.com, domsolo.com, domasg.com, and mailgobi.com)\".There was no response from Liquid Web to that earlier email either.There were other emails including my last on 16-Aug-23 asking for a status update seeing as I was still receiving spam.And yet again, no response from Liquid Web to that email either.They are consistent at failing at the basics."

          "Contenu": "Although I left a good review 1+ years ago, ListHub's service has deteriorated dramatically. It seems they have outsourced Support to a very low-grade provider, who is just interested in reducing handling time, rather than solving the client's problem. First off, when you contact their support chat, the techs start providing answers, without waiting for the customer to advise the question.  So prepare yourself for the first 5 to 10 minutes to be a complete waste of time while the tech digs up a reply to a question you have not asked plus have no plan to ask!Second, anything related to buying Cloudflare via LiquidWeb, is a disaster.  Techs literally just send you a link to their internal set up documentation (which is either outdated or inaccurate) and don't wait for your question.   They send the link to the document and then terminate the call.  Shocking!!Third, if you do get a Tech to stay on the call long enough to read your question, then be prepared to get the wrong answer 4 times out of 5 (yes, literally) and be prepared for this to take days or weeks, rather than minutes or hours. Implementing a CDN is a little complex and their Support know very little about it.  In fact one of their sales/support team told me they couldn't provide support as it is a 3rd-party product.  LiquidWeb are happy to charge you, but Techs are not trained on providing Support.4th, the Techs always seem to default to responding about adding more DOMAINS, rather than adding more USERS to the account.  Despite us never ever asking about adding more domains and only asking about adding more Users (our Developers), the Techs always default to advising how easy it is to add more Domains. From our experience, DO NOT purchase Cloudflare via LiquidWeb as very few Techs know anything about it.  If any issues arise, it will take hours or even days to get the correct answer. In our case, it is months and we still don't have it resolved. We are still waiting to add more users and continue to be told about adding more domains.  But, we only have one domain!  We don't want to add more domains.  Please stop telling us about more domains!!"

If you are looking for an honest managed dedicated hosting company with truly great support, as a long-time customer I warn you to ignore the dishonest ads and stay away. This company is 100% Hustler with zero customer service integrity.Multiple times I have discovered that I had zero or outdated backups available. This has happened several times this past year alone. I keep reaching out to Liquid Web support to try to resolve the issue but most of their support agents are extremely rude and disrespectful to communicate with.Today I discovered again, by chance that my server had not been backed up in 72 hours (3-day old files). I contacted Linux support and tried very hard to explain (to an agent who seemed that she could not have cared less) that if I needed to restore one of my WordPress sites and that if a recent backup was not available, my business would be over - The Liquid Web support agent responded to me saying that \"... it was my responsibility to contact them and ask them to run a backup\". Her reply can actually be confirmed by their own call transcript if they recorded the call as they claim to do.Two weeks prior I contacted them to request support for my backup files and checked back an hour later and discovered their support agent deleted every backup file for every website on the server. Again ZERO backups were available. This can be confirmed by chat and email transcripts.I would have migrated away from this company a long time ago, but migration is not easy when you have large sites and also want to avoid risking DNS downtime. But being a Liquid Web customer since 2016 my business is now suffering by having to constantly police this issue with them. Until I can get my websites over to a new host, I will be taking my own backups manually and downloading them away from Liquid Web so that I can be sure I have backups ready when I need them.Email and chat transcripts can validate this review."

We were desperate so we did, but they took days to implement and restore issues from the hackers.  We ended up losing many clients.  Then, our server was coming up on EOL OS and needed to be upgraded, so we asked them to do that but they told us we need to buy a second server to migrate our current server to the new server.

Reason I paid for 2 years in advance is because of the attractive discount.2 years flew by and it was time to renew. During these 2 years, support was good but not as good as WiredTree. But I was with them and had no intention of changing anyway, so I went ahead to renew. Was shocked to learn that the 2-year discount offer was only for new customers and not existing customers. This meant a more than 100% increase in costs for services that I feel are really over priced. I managed to find another host with similar features, at a quarter of what they charge. I moved out from LiquidWeb a year ago to the new host and have no regrets.Honestly, LiquidWeb servers are over priced but with 2 year discount packages when paid up front, it is ok. When the discounts are removed, it is totally not worth it."

If they notice that you don\u2019t login, they charge more.Current 4gb vps promotional price is $49Regular current 4gb vps price is $99What they charged for my 4gb vps for months = $149 !!!!!I also noticed that ip price is $1 but they charged me $2 per ip for years.When I noticed that they are charging my card more than they should, I openned a ticket. They told me that they write their prices on their website and I need to check my bills regularly. I requested a refund but its been weeks and they dont even reply.And before that happen they downgraded my server without telling while I was paying the same price. When I checked my server configuration I noticed that it was downgraded and they said it was an accident and upgraded it back. I thought it was a mistake at first but im not sure anymore.Used their services for many many years. If you dont keep an eye on the bills they will charge more.But I must say that their service doesn\u2019t have downtimes and support is generally pretty fast but terrible at billing."

Their latest billing change now makes it so that customers who don't pay their bill one day after it is created are considered 'overdue' by Liquid Web. They have gone from a Net 15 days company to Net 0 and are requiring customers to put in some form of payment card or Paypal account number in the account which is then forced into AutoPay. I spoke directly with an Account Services Specialist and had this confirmed. By forcing customers to put a credit card or Paypal, they will then bill you immediately on day bill is created. Even companies as bad as Xfinity give you 30 days to pay your bill. As I had an old credit card listed on my account I received a scary e-mail stating that if I didn't immediately pay my bill, my service would be disconnected. I have paid the same way for 12 years and now Liquid Web is saying you must pay immediately or else we will cut you off. This is why they are now losing customers and gaining the reputation hey have.It's sad as they were the only hosting company our news site promoted."

Since I have never seen an invoice generated with a due date earlier than the date of the invoice, I called Billing and was on hold for 47 minutes. Since this long wait time was also a first time Liquidweb experience for me, I called Sales and was immediately commented to someone in Texas who told me he had just arrived in the office and that his email was filled with questions from customers regarding this same issue. I later called Billing again and was successful in getting through. I was told that this is the new business policy of the billing department of Liquidweb, to not invoice until after the due date and to threaten immediate suspension of service with that late invoice.After over 14 years of being a loyal customer (I even won a prize from Liquidweb for posting a testimonial a couple of years ago), I feel I must move to a more reliable hosting provider. Thank all the oldtimers for their wonderful service over the years."

After multiple contacts, 9 MONTHS after the original contact, they finally send me an exemption form. Having already paid over $200 in taxes I should not have been billed for in the first place (and LW wouldn't refund), I have left LW and am much happier for it and saving about $80pm on fees. They have lost $7,100 in server fees over the next 5 years, and possibly triple that as I have two other dedicated servers elsewhere. That's what they get for implementing a tax without 1. Training staff properly about the tax, including their Billing staff, and 2. Not setting up their online system correctly so that Ltd companies without VAT registration can opt out. 3. Taking 9 months to enable me to opt out. The form they sent me in September should have been sent in January. It's a complete farce which, as you can see, LW take no responsibility for. Awful company in my opinion."

I needed to migrate to a more powerful server and change my OS from CentOS to AlmaLinux. I needed everything set up by July 5 morning. I signed up and paid for a two-year plan on July 1, Saturday night. I was told that the new server would be set up in minutes and that the migration would take another 24 hours. However, the tech support's attempt to provision a new server failed. They said the issue had been passed on to the \"development\" team, and that someone would get back to me soon. I don't think the tech support can set up a server, and they knew no one from the development team would be in until July 5 to set it up. I expected an honest and realistic timeline. All I got was multiple tech support folks passing the tickets to each other. As of now, NOTHING has been set up. I am unsure if LiquidWeb is having financial problems and is short of staff or whether they have cut down on technical staff, hoping the customers will not notice. However, the marketing staff has contacted me in the meantime to discuss plans. I notice that the tech support now aggressively markets security plans. This tardy service and false disclosure are not the LiquidWeb I knew. Not sure if they are having financial problems internally or if the investors are now demanding higher returns. The tech support staff I get for other issues seems competent and helpful. However, this poor experience setting up a new server and migration has left me wondering if I should demand a refund and move to another host."

There used to be some guys that are very knowledgeable and were willing to make the extra step to help you out on tricky issues, although the knowledgeable guys seem to no longer work there.CONS: The billing charges one's card without notifying in advance on what exactly the amount will be charged, thus price increases can surprise you. And tricky extra charges are also a shocker.Very expensive for what you get.LiquidWeb automatically enrolls you in auto-pay via credit card or your bank account (direct debit) via Paypal, so they can charge your card or withdraw any amount directly from your Paypal account and if your Paypal acc. has zero balance then from your bank account! And you are unable to remove your bank account number from their records! They won't accept bank wire or manual Paypal balance payments, so you're stuck providing LW either your credit card or Paypal/bank account for them to help themselves in your account for any amount.Made a 2 year deal with a fixed amount paid to LW but a year after I paid for 2 years LW is already charging me extra money on the balance despite the agreement and prepaid hosting for 2 years. One year after the deal they stopped sending me zero invoices via email, but started sneaking in extra sneaky charges of unknown unidentified origin. When asked what those charges are the billing department gives some smoke and mirrors answer.The live chat constantly closes from lost connection. Can't even save the chat transcript. Or the chat will get stuck for hours in waiting being never attended.There's a lack of knowledgeable staff since most of their best staff has already left the company and you can read about that on the internet forums. The support will for days conveniently ignore more complex issues they were able to fix in the past and only address issues that are simplest in nature, but usually reply is written that there's nothing they can do about it, leaving customer stranded looking for help elsewhere or moving to another, more modern, knowledgeable and more flexible host.Simple questions they were easily able to answer and address now are repeatedly ignored, even if asked twice, just to confirm things.The best days of LiquidWeb heroic support and fair billing are clearly over. I am looking to move elsewhere."

So I fixed all the issues on the website that were causing spam, and asked Liquidwebweb for a new IP. They refused, so no way to fix the issues without outgoing mail being rejected.I then discovered they had sold the client various other services they didn't need or know how to use, including the business email, which they had never setup for them.So I moved all their email from their server to the business email service and got everything working.Liquid web then blocked the mailbox that was being used to send email from the website, causing more problems.We got the mailbox unblocked, liquidweb support, and insisted everything was working, but we still couldn't send email.Finally they admit they had actually blocked the entire server/IP from sending email through the business email server completely due to the bad reputation of the IP.Yes they were blocking their own IP from one of their own servers, which they had refused to replace, causing this situation in the first place.So we switched to using a 3rd party SMTP relay service (mailersend), but this was also failing, because liquidweb had actually blocked all outgoing SMTP from the server to anywhere.So we have an e-commerce site that cannot send email to any customer using any method because liquidweb have blocked everything and won't do anything to help and won't give us a new IP.Now in process to migrating site to a new provider."

          "Contenu": "May 2020: Update. The support is just awful. I had a problem with one account on a dedicated server going down. It took 3.5 hours for someone to respond and they had made a minor changed and asked if I had fixed it myself. It's now been a week, they have changed the settings back on the account so that the sites sometimes loads quickly and sometimes hangs.  This is exactly what I was going thru last year.  I will send 3 numbered questions and get one response about a change they made while answering none of my questions.  It often takes days for them to respond and then I resort to opening a new ticket in order to get them to respond to my initial ticket.  Based on their replies, there doesn't seem to be any ability for the people that work there to look over the past information from the ticket.  I'm sure that's not the case, but that's what it seems like.  I'm now shopping for a new data center.  Liquid Web is completely unreliable in times of need.  I asked in a previous ticket and was told that if the server goes down, they should be able to get to it in 30 minutes.  Totally unacceptable!April 2019: Their infrastructure is great. Their customer support used to be better.  Now my tickets are shuffled from tech to tech, getting different answers from each one.  If I ask more than one question, they don't all get answers.  Ticket history doesn't seem to be read.  If you keep pushing you can get somewhere. It just takes work on your end."

          "Contenu": "I have been with Bluehost and MDDHosting. I do not recall spending so much time with their support (although to be fair--they each had their issues or I would not be here now). I was recommended last year to give Liquid Web a go. I wanted to hand the entire migration process off to someone on my team. It did not happen, as it was complicated. I am a technical person to a certain degree, but not enough to have avoided a tenuous migration process. This was last October. There were then a variety of different issues that were resolved until we hit a recurring one this past summer. I was on chat with a support person who told me I should take them up on their \"only one day\" left spring server special! She said it would stop the issues I was having. It was double the price monthly. I agreed as she gave a lot of credence to the upgraded server being something I could rely on. I have my payments each month automatically deducted from my credit card. I do not always check the credit card. Long story short, I had been charged for the old server the last few months. In speaking with their tech team after blowing a fuse. I was informed they keep the old server going until I tell them I want to get rid of it. Unfortunately, NO ONE informed me of this at all. NO ONE. Not the person who sold me their spring special, no one since then--nothing. My responsibility is that I did not check my credit card statement. Their responsibility is when you have people who work for you and they sell a client into something new, they should also tell the client that they will continue to have the old server and be charged for it. I did not go through this at the other server companies, as the monthly cost of 99.00 is what I paid for one year at MDD and about half what I paid at Bluehost annually. For a client who did not have the background or experience with moving servers within a company this was not cool. You need to inform your clients when YOU sell them a new item. I was given one month of a refund, instead of the past few months. Had I not noticed my credit card statement, it could've gone on even longer. I do not and have not used the old server (again I had no clue that I could since no one felt the need to tell me). I gave two stars, because they are expedient in tech response, though some of the issues I have had took quite awhile to be fixed. I am grudgingly looking to move server companies again. Ugh, but I seriously am not down for the attitude of customer service at Liquid Web."

          "Contenu": "This review is a tad long, but I assure you it is worth your time. I am convinced that most poor reviews are written in a frustrated and heated moment, however, my review is going to calmly explain my full situation so that you can make an educated decision for yourself.I own a small web design and hosting company. As a start-up we used self-managed VPS machines to host our client websites. However, we found that most of our time was dedicated to system administration rather than the business itself and so decided to find a company we could partner with to manage the overall support for system/server side of things. In other words, they handle the server and we handle our business. Unfortunately, from day 1 it was nothing but problems with their customer and technical support.We purchased a 1 year pre-paid plan (bad idea since they have a NO REFUND POLICY). We asked if we could use Plesk instead of cPanel with our server. They said it was impossible to use Plesk and use the server OS we had. This was not true since we were using it on another server just fine. After about 30 mins of transfers to different level technicians, they finally agreed it could be done. We then asked for them to install CloudLinux and we went through the same charades to get it approved. Once it was approved they added a $20/m fee, even though a personal license is only $14 from CloudLinux directly. Since I had my own license I asked if I could just use that instead and they refused. Obviously an upsell tactic, but poor service in my book.After the server was all established we were assigned an Account Manager since we were considered a part of their \"Partners\" program. The Partner program is nothing more than a few videos and write ups on basic web hosting and server management. However, you apparently have access to a Dedicated Account Manager and a free WHMCS license. At first, these two things caused me to feel valued in our pursuit to build a relationship with another company. However, I requested the WHMCS license several times and never received an answer. My account manager was also difficult to get a hold of and gave empty promises when I asked to expand our relationship.As an example, they had a new years sale and we decided that it was a good time to expand our capabilities. We contacted our account manager and asked if we could upgrade the server we had just purchased and pay the difference for the upgrade since it was less than 30 days. This would have resulted in doubling our initial investment with them. He agreed and asked me to contact sales and let them know that he approved it. I did as instructed and not only was I told he did not have the authority to approve it, the representative was short and rude. I attempted to get a hold of my account manager to discuss the issue again and he never responded back.During this time I was charged $70 with no explanation. I opened up a chat to discuss the charges and they said they had to elevate it to a ticket. I waited 4 days without a response and had to open up another chat to get it looked at. It was \"corrected\" and funds credited to my account, but still no explanation of why it happened, what was corrected and only half the charge was credited. A month passed and I was not billed for anything, however the following month I was billed for $20. I asked for an explanation and they said it was the CloudLinux fee. I explained that during the process of installing Cloudlinux I asked to be taken down from Fully managed to Core managed, which was reflective in tickets/email and lowered the price. They said there was no record of the conversation, even though I had it in my email as proof.To conclude, I am patient and reasonable, but Liquid Web has poor communication among themselves and overall poor customer service. I will say I had one tech that was excellent when installing Plesk but overall as a company, go elsewhere. Sadly, there are more issues but I have limited space left..."

          "Contenu": "I've been with Liquid Web for more than 10 years and in the last two years the support quality has changed. Depending upon who picks up your ticket you might get a knowledgeable engineer, or someone that is barely able to identify and correct your issue. I am very disappointed with the way renewal is handled. Instead of providing you a path to a 1 or 2 year upfront payment option with discount, they make you wait until your current contract expires to determine your new pricing.The invoices always say zero dollars in email. You have to open your management interface to find out what was paid and how much was paid. I have discovered mistakes from time to time that were only caught after I closely checked my invoices online each month.Recently they upgraded a system on a Weekend late at night and almost immediately I started receiving high load warnings every hour at the exact same time. When I called in for support the technician tried to tell me it was an issue with memory and suggested I upgrade my server. I hung up on him, and called back. The next tech said there was an issue on their end they were working on but would not share the details and insisted on creating a ticket. He failed to create the ticket after I ended the call.When I did not receive the ticket and called back again and this time the tech told me straight up that an upgrade to their backend had broken backup disc storage and was creating the issue. He did issue a ticket, unmounted my storage, and then I waited a week for a correction.I still want to believe in LW and continue my hosting with the company, but these annoyances have left me pause to consider other VPS providers. I have many clients I setup on their own LW VPS offerings and I manage their sites on those servers. This obviously creates excess service hours when multiple VPS's are affected by a backend upgrade. Currently I rate them 3 of 5. They need to be more consistent in the support department, more transparent in billing, and come up with a way of addressing renewal offerings before the end of each annual contract expiration. In that they are not a low cost provider compared to their competition they do need to address these issues to keep long time customers from jumping ship."

So two more stars.But these should not have happened in the first place.I am not satisfied with their services. It is such a messy and disorganized support team. Why?1) They constantly ask me to buy SS+ or Threat Stack. On each ticket. It is like you are being spammed constantly on your own tickets that you open.2) SS+ package previously broke my site. So we discussed with one of their team members to EXCLUSIVELY avoid disabling set_ini function. After several confirmations, I gave them the green light, and they STILL disabled the set_ini3) It does not stop there. I opened another ticket to cancel LimitLoginAttempts rules because I found a plugin that does the job. Then first, my .htaccess file got broken, and then user.ini file broke down due to a setting included PHP 7.2, which does not even exist on the server!!!While all of this is happening, sales are plummeting, and traffic is dropping organic traffic is suffering.These are not professional guys; it feels like just a few bunches of kids playing behind computer screens. And I must add the \"account manager\" is a joke. He just evaporated, not able to follow up anything.I am not migrating only because it was a big hassle to migrate and introduce my website to another company. But I think I will have to do that soon.OLD review: I am not always having the best experience, but their support is really dedicated and hard-working."

          "Contenu": "Quick summary: paid by PayPal. Told have to produce two ID documents for \"Fraud Prevention\". Didn't want to. Refund ok - but seems to take a week. Don't understand why they took the money before the checks rather than the other way around.Detailed narrative: I paid them a substantial sum of money. They took the money from my PayPal account and started demanding that I send them two forms of government Photo ID to actually provide the service I had just paid for. They said this was \"Fraud Protection\" but very odd then that they went ahead and took the money before seeing my ID. If they thought it was a possible fraud surely they should have done the checks and then taken the money? I lost all trust and cancelled.It is important to clarify in response to the claims from LiquidWeb below that a) I paid by PayPal for the hosting which is an available payment option and b) despite saying this was a fraud protection measure they took the money from my PayPal account before checking my documents. They then refused to provide me with the already paid for service until I had provided the documents. The phrase \u00abLiquid Web cannot take payment from your PayPal account\u00bb I don't quite understand. I have a PayPal statement showing a payment from my account to LiquidWeb! Perhaps they can explain this?(As a side note they demanded that I send the documents by insecure email as open jpegs - not even a password protected archive).Update! Ok. I sent the money from PayPal; they didn't \u00abgo into the account\u00bb. I don't think this is important. The point I want to make clear to readers is that they said \u00abFraud Protection\u00bb - but they took/I sent (via their PayPal integration which they set up) the money Before they saw the ID documents. They then refused to provide a service before seeing two government photo IDs. Just be aware that this can happen(Hopefully - final update. The refund it seems can take several days. Though the payment to them seems to have been instant. This means my funds are tied up for days).Update! I paid with bank account not a card but perhaps that does not make a difference.But - let's not lose sight of the main point!!!! - If Liquid Web had not taken/received the payment Before blocking provision of the service for \"Fraud Protection\" we would not have been in this position. This is my point. They should not take funds and then raise further demands to provide the service. If they want to raise further demands they should do this, give the client the choice, and only take the funds when they are actually going to provide the service."

          "Titre": "Two years of managed hosting",
          "Contenu": "LiquidWeb hosted my web server for two years. Startup was simple, and the live chat and phone support were very helpful each time I needed assistence. I would have gave five stars, however my main concern is clarity of pricing and billing. When I signed up I had no idea that I would not be able to pay the same rate in the next billing cycle, so  when the price increased three-fold, and I had spent two years saving, I realized I had no choice but to move on. This also took place in the cPanel email, and I'm not sure whose fault it is, but they said it would increase annually and then I started getting monthly bills for five dollars. To me, the word annual means yearly, not monthly. I don't want to blame LiquidWeb for this. It's all good. In the future however, I would rather see paying, returning, long time customers receive the discounts instead of new members. I must say that the support team has been excellent. In all the two years I did not have any downtime that was unscheduled, and my connection speeds were best. There is a lot of behind the scenes management that was taken care of for me by the technical staff here at LiquidWeb, also, and for that I recommend anybody looking to start a business or corporate website to use LiquidWeb. If you are like me, and just want a fileserver to share photography and homemade music with friends, maybe get something more budget friendly.Thank you for reading this review."

The first 2 began well then went downhill. Both gave stellar live chat support initially, but, as they grew, the response times got worse as did the service once you finally connected. With the last one, I regularly got stuck in the \"swamp\" for 10, 20 even 30 minutes before being connected.On a friend's recommendation I changed to Liquid Web about 5-6 years ago and haven't looked back. I've done at least 2 if not 3 hardware upgrades as my needs changed and they've always been extremely helpful. And all this wonderful support does NOT come at a premium cost. I've found their pricing to be extremely competitive and their support outstanding.I unreservedly recommend them as a single site host or someone, like me, who wants to buy space to host numerous sites.EDIT: As of today - April 30, 2019 - I have removed a star. My PCI scan failed due to a quite outdated OpenSSH on the server. I have had to pay $75 for them to upgrade their software on my server. Not on. I have no control over the software installed. Despite paying a reasonable amount for my server setup, this is the sort of thing cheap hosts do - using outdated software.Had this been less critical to my business, I wouldn't have altered my review; however, begin fined every day I'm out of compliance, then being charged not to be fined is not my idea of great support."

Alex stepped in (although not part of the migration team) and FIXED my issue.  He listened to my frustration as the migration team felt my issue was not a server issue.  In the end because of Alex, he made a server tweak and saved the day.  I'm grateful that he picked up my support call as it was a very stressful 3-day trying to get everything working properly as I moved TWO servers to new servers.THANK YOU ALEX!! You deserve a raise! I know when you answer the call I have the \"A\" team on it.  Fantastic support because of Alex!"

They are quick to respond and patient with customers like me, who may not understand how tech support is helping me to resolve issues with my WordPress website.  My most recent experience with Kohl revealed that the information I was provided by my WordPress developer, was not what the developer claimed. Kohl was patient and kind as he shared his knowledge of what I now refer to as a \u201cfalse positive critical error\u201d.  Kohl spent as much time with me as I needed to get my questions answered and gain a sufficient understanding of the recommendations. I am grateful for the service Liquid Web provides and grateful to Kohl for taking the time to explain in non-technical terms what, how, and why.   Thank you, Kohl, and the entire Liquid Web Team! More than hosting, Liquid Web truly has the \u201cMost Helpful Humans in Hosting\u201d.If you want dependable hosting and helpful humans, Liquid Web is your solution."
