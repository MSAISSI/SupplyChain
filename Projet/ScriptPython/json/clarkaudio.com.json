In my opinion it is a scam"

If you make any kind of Lo-Fi, you're using eq's, saturation, filters and other such things to \"dirty\" up your sound... this plug-in does all that for you with some great presets right out of the box. My only gripe is that I wish there was a mono legato mode for the synth basses and synth leads. One plugin can't do EVERYTHING, I guess. This is something you want in your toolbox though. Great idea from Clark Audio executed very well."
