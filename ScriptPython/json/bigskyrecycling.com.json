All I wanted to do was be able to recycle all the items so they didn\u2019t end up on a landfill.  I had already checked Apple Recycling and Walmart Recycling.  Too many rules and exceptions for both of them\u2026Big Sky said the would accept ALL of the items, and since there were at least 5 cellphones, they paid for shipping!!!  I mailed everything in one box.  That experience in itself I think is amazing.  But I\u2019m struggling to find the words to express the relief I felt when I mailed off that box.  And it took only one trip to the post office!Thank you Big Sky Recycling!"
