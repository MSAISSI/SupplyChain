I will say that the quality has always been good but I probably won\u2019t ever order from them again solely based off the fact that the importance of customer service just doesn\u2019t seem to exist anymore."

They inform me that one of the items I ordered was not available (they couldn\u2019t have emailed me weeks prior?). So this whole time their customer service rep has been lying to me saying that the package is on the way when, in fact, it had never shipped.

I was able to get help through email. I talked to one lady and they stated that 3 of my 6 items were out of stock and would not be back in till next year, we are in February. They offered to switch the out of stock items for others but when I went online they had the last time on the list in stock. I emailed back asking why it shows online that it was available and how can I tell if the item i want to switch out is in stock or not.  I got a short answer you can look online.  I again asked the same question how do I known if it's in stock or not. I got a short answer of a website link to the sweaters on the website, still showing the sweater available. I finally had to call on 3/10/2023 and Valerie helped and stated only one of the 3 was not available. Which was one I didn't look up online. however, it was the one I wanted most for myself. I was able to switch it for something I really didn't want another black hoodie but at least the other 5 sweaters for my family might arrive before winters over.  I asked why I had to call to find out it wasn't shipping and if I didn't call would they just take my money and never ship? she said it must have been an error in the system, a classic none answer."

          "Contenu": "I was very disappointed with the way my order went.  First of all, it took 11 days for my order to reach me from Florida to Missouri.  The reason being is that DHL (slowest company ever) was involved in transferring my order to US Postal Service.  After reaching the final big city before arriving to my local post office, it was held up another three days (St. Louis is 2 hrs from my home).  After finally receiving my order, you left out 3 items from it!  Now, I will have to wait another 7 - 11 days for those items.  While at the SA Company website to find out what happened to the rest of my order prior to finally reaching them by phone after 3 days of trying to call or chat, The lady I spoke to spoke as if she did not care about my frustration or complaint and never apologized.  By the way, if your chat says a customer service agent will be with you in five minutes, and, it shows your live online, then that five minutes should be accurate, not never show up!  it took calling 4 -5 times to finally reach a person by phone (the rude lady beforementioned).  I was told I was sent an email about my siutation, at least I got that within 24 hrs as stated by their phone message.  Basically this company wants to avoid phone calls and chat and keep you guessing if you're order will make it when they screw up.  This issue gives me that impression at least.  When I shell out almost $70 of my hard earned money, I expect better communication, as well as better customer service.  If you're not going to use your chat or answer the phone number you provided as contact then take them down!  Under staffing is no excuse anymore!  You can adjust by limiting your contact to a certain way in order to handle customer needs in a timely manner.  Lastly, not everyone is comfortable with just email communication when \"shelling out\" the amount of money that I did for this recent order. I used to receive any products from your company within a week easily.  Now you guys are \"dropping the ball\" and have lost my business!  There are plenty of other companies out there that offer products just like yours!"

The main issue I had before dealing with customer service debacle is the fact that my \u201csize 30\u201d board shorts actually measured 33 inches at the waist. Turns out that\u2019s how all of their board shorts are. The actual waist size is larger than the labeled size number, which is confusing and frankly makes no sense. Anyways, after plenty of time wasted trying to contact them with no response, I figured it was worth letting others know how they conduct their business. Which is unfortunate because I like their face shields and hats. Hence the 2 stars instead of 1"

And it wasn't even delivered to me in canada instead it was sent to Some state in USA on the other side of country. Customer service helped me to reship it but again after 15 days same thing repeats and it was shipped to some random place in USA. How can a company make such a terrible mistake and wasting over a month of my time and honestly the refund is also not fair enough. I had to pay in CAD and when i recieved my refund i lost money. I would only consider this company saving my money and utilising it for their profits and giving me back at loss. Worst experience i could ever have online. I had such good faith for service and even requested my friends to order which i regret saying."

The operator informed me the package seemed to be lost in transit and that he could send me a new batch of my products with the exception of 1 item that was out of stock. This item was added on a discounted price through the offer I got and was an important part of the purchase for me. We agreed to wait it out and hope the original package got found and sent back to SA Fishing so I could get the last item and something extra for my patience. Suddenly a short period after this I got confirmation of my package was sent to me. The order email did not contain any extras or that 1 item I had ordered.I have received my package without the item. The item on discount cost 10 USD and I have not received any refund on my missing item. I shall contact SA Fishing and see what their explanation is."

The Customer Service response was prompt, and useful. Unfortunately, what they found out out was one of the shirts I ordered was out of stock, and not likely to be back in stock any time soon? Why wasn\u2019t I notified of this sooner? Only after I reached out did I learn this information. If I had been notified of the back order in a timely manner I likely would have had the remainder of the order shipped to me. But, due to the previous (poor) experience I canceled the entire order.Again, was pleased with the quality of the first order when it finally arrived. If customer service was as strong as sales efforts (SA constantly notifies me of sales and deals via text) it would be an improvement.Haven\u2019t decided if I\u2019ll ever order again or not. Unfortunately, as of right now it is a \u201cno\u201d. Communication with your customers is important, folks, even if the news/updates isn\u2019t good."

The reason I am only giving 3 stars is because they claim they will give $25 of bonus stuff with your order and that is not the case and what seems to be a scam. When I didn\u2019t receive my bonus stuff I emailed them and after some back and forth emails I was given the option to choose from some things like a sticker and a can cookie. For $25!? Funny how you can get 8 face shields for $16 but  for a bonus first time buyer you get a sticker for $25. I would suggest ordering elsewhere just because of that."

I selected the sizes and added to my cart. I proceeded to continue my checkout process only to find the sizes I had selected were changed and now they were all the same sizes of the same shirt. I contacted customer service and after 3+ days was provided a link to complete my order. I followed the link and paid for the items. I then noticed the sizes were showing the same as what I saw when I added them to my cart. I reached out to customer service again, via text, and after 2 hours of back and forth communication, was told the order has been adjusted and will ship out soon. On a previous order, November 2022, I ordered some hoodies and was excited when they came in; they were better than what the website showed. Unfortunately, within the last few weeks, I have noticed, the material on the sleeve of one of the hoodies is starting to fall apart and is almost transparent/see through. \ud83d\ude2cI have purchased multiple items and have liked all of it\u2026 until this situation."

At this point I contacted customer service and would have really liked to speak to somebody but, no one was available.  I tried the chat option and no one was available but, I did receive an email and text response a short time later. I was told it was picked up by a different carrier and it was on the way. I  Checked the tracking number at the other Carrier and the package shows it was picked up. My only suggestion is to tell customers of the 3 options of delivery and to check the tracking number on all 3.  This would have saved me time and an interruption of your day to respond."

It's made from a lightweight and breathable material that feels comfortable on my skin, even during intense physical activity like running or hiking.The gaiter has a stretchy fabric that easily covers my entire face and neck, and can be adjusted to fit snugly without feeling constricting. It's also versatile and can be worn in different ways, such as around the neck, as a headband or beanie, or even as a wristband.One thing I really appreciate about this gaiter is how easy it is to care for. It's machine washable and dries quickly, which is great for frequent use.Overall, I think this face gaiter is a great option for anyone looking for a comfortable and versatile face covering for outdoor activities or everyday wear. It provides excellent coverage, is easy to care for, and comes in a variety of colors and patterns to suit any style."

We just spent about $60 on some clearanced hoodies on our last order and payed $28 in shipping fees, there is no free shipping on clearance items. The website says, \u201cYou qualify for free shipping\u201d but when I went to pay, it was adding the shipping fee on. Too bad that it\u2019s not based on price to get the free shipping, we would definitely order a lot more. But that $28 shipping fee was almost the same price as 3 clearanced hoodies. And that\u2019s for the basic, slowest shipping.  There are just too many other companies that offer free shipping. Great products though!"

          "Contenu": "This was my 3rd time ordering. The products are wonderful for lots of reasons.  They are well made and comfortable.  When I saw the fleece face shields I knew I needed them to keep warm while outside this winter.  I am a member of the Mandalorian Mercs costume club and knew the white fleece shield would be perfect for my costume and would keep my nose cozy. I ordered a few more items, black for the hubs, and the nebula because I love the pattern.  I received everything very quick. Unfortunately the white face smile I received was substituted for a different pattern.  I first checked my order to see if it was my mistake.  It was not.  I contacted customer service and Karol was AMAZING.  She emailed me back apologizing for the mix up and got the corrected white face shield reordered for me and made sure I received the order information and shipping details.I did not expect such fast and easy customer service.  I love the products and would encourage any  people looking for cosplay gaiters to cover their necks and to keep warm to order from SA Company.I also encourage outdoor enthusiasts to do the same! They are SOOOO good!"

I sent SA an electronic message on Memorial Day with a suggestion for future orders to include same size items when giving away freebies. I received a response within minutes thanking me for my feedback. Although it wasn't necessary, they insisted on sending me another set of sleeves which was greatly appreciated. I have ordered from this company in the past and have always been pleased with them. SA went above and beyond to make sure I was a satisfied customer and I will continue to use them in the future."

I contacted customer service because I did not have the order number for that hat to check the status. The lady helping me, Joan, was able to look up my order and inform me that the hat was no longer available. She assured me that I could choose any of the others as a replacement and it would be shipped out right away. I actually liked the replacement choice better. So this was a win-win for me, as I only paid $10 for the sale hat and was replaced for the same hat (with different words) that I liked even better! Still I did not have the pay the full price and I think that was an exceptional solution. In a day and age where it\u2019s hard to fine good personal \u201ccustomer service\u201d, Joan\u2019s responses and attention were very refreshing and reassuring that there really are people who care about the customer on the other end!!"
