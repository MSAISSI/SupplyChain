          "Titre": "Ok product, overpriced, owner unprofessional",
          "Contenu": "I like the software, but I think it\u2019s overpriced for what I use it for. I don\u2019t do any cold calling which, if you do this marketing strategy, I think you would benefit from. Maybe they could have less features for users like me at a lower price. Beyond that, they have a pretty good community that is helpful at times, but I do think the owner of the company(who is very vocal) is unprofessional. If anyone were to leave a bad review of the company, he will most likely blast it to his Facebook group.I really do not want to spread negativity about the product because I do think it is useful. I use a CRM within my business that has way more functionality, but is lacking on the data management aspect so this is where REISift comes into play. Here is the main difference I see. And let me say, it has nothing to do with the product itself. There are Facebook communities around both platforms. (Reisift and RESimpli) If you are a part of both of these communities, you will see a trend throughout. Reisift has a community with a lot of negativity while RESimpli is constantly catering to its users the best they can. RESimpli has an owner who genuinely cares about it\u2019s users and their business. For example, he discounted everyone\u2019s monthly subscription during the pandemic and has also sent gifts to all users out of gratitude. As you scroll through the different communities, one gives off positive vibes, while the other usually only negative. If it\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned throughout my entrepreneurial journey, it\u2019s that the way you treat people directly correlates to how successful you are. Yes, hard work is a big part of it but the way you genuinely care about one another is what will take you to the next level. Now, does my CRM have its downsides? Of course, just like any other platform. But another difference I see is that one platform is thanking users for their suggestions while the other is criticizing them. The second my CRM (RESimpli) catches up on the data management side we will be transitioning. And we are so close to being there! And it\u2019s not because of the platform itself\u2026it\u2019s because of the community. Because if REISift had a little more of a positive environment then I might stick with them no matter what. And might I get blasted for this review? It\u2019s entirely possible. But it\u2019s also possible that I change a life. Maybe I will change the world. You know what? This review might change the entire trajectory of this country. Bottom line\u2026it\u2019s not all about how hard you work, how much discipline you have, or how much you think you want to be successful. IT IS HOW MUCH YOU CARE! Care about others, and their business, and their overall success. And most can tell when a company is genuine and when one isn\u2019t. Do you care about those around you? Let that sink in\u2026If the world were to end today would you be satisfied with the legacy you left on this earth? Or would you be regretful about those you\u2019ve left wondering\u2026"

I do appreciate the CEO reaching out so I updated my original harsh review which could have been mainly on me not utilizing the basic subscription."

We immediately felt in love with the app, not only we were given several tools to expand our business but we were trained by an awesome team. REISift helped us understand our data way better and make small changes in our SOPs to increase productivity and find better deals. It didn't stop there, they kept launching new features and resources to make our life easier, with their courses we learned new techniques to reach prospect sellers faster and with little effort. REISift is very powerful and might sound hard to operate but on the contraire it's intuitive and very straight forward, and if you ever need help the support team is always easy to reach and super friendly.They have great subscription plans for all investor sizes but I recommend you go for the Professional or Business as you will payback that investment on your first deal."

          "Contenu": "This is literally the first software ANY & EVERY real estate related business should have in their tech stack.Although it's an incredible crm don't let the \"CRM\" label deter you from testing it out thinking I already have that (and be ready to quickly realize that you have been missing out this whole time).Their data management features are first in class and can be integrated with any other CRM or software out there.With that said, here are my 3 favorite features:1) REI sift check ALL MY DATA every month for vacancies. (The money saved from acquiring this data alone is enough to pay for the software)2) It automatically separates incomplete/business/entities for our team to clean and get better results from our skiptracing. (Must people ignore/exclude this type of date a.k.a. great source of leads with minimal to no competition)3) Phone tags - this is a game-changer as far as gathering insight from your marketing. Every other software only lets you tag the overall contact/property. Being able to discard a phone (without deleting it to prevent marketing to it again) is just FREGGIN EPIC!Any serious real estate business should master data and REI Sift is the ONLY software that allows you to do so.Give it a shot... trust me, you won't look back."

Prior to REISift I was managing all my marketing and data using Google Sheets and over time it became overwhelming to keep track of things and wasted a ton of money with Skip Tracing. The other aspects of REISift offers such as the list stacking, the ability to tag records and phone numbers, and the ability to get as granular as possible with leads that I have not been able to reach  have all been essential in my business. I would highly recommend  this tool for anyone in the real estate space looking for a way to manage their marketing and data."
