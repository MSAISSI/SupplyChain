You can tell a lot about a company in how they deal with situations like this. Avoid.Edit: UK consumer law states that a cooling off period should be applied after an auto-renewal and the recommend 14 days. Nord are ignoring my UK rights despite saying on their website that local laws will lead to exemptions in policy."

This is unacceptable.I requested a refund and was told that I was over the 30 days but the software is defective!!I'm not happy at all with the way they've handled this. I've been told to try numerous \"fixes\" that clearly wouldn't fix the problem, such as start my browser in \"incognito\" mode, this despite the problem being with a separate app!! Nothing they've suggested has worked."

I've emailed customer support probably a dozen times, still no dice.  I AM NOT PAYING YOU TO ASSIST YOU WITH FIXING MY COMPUTER.  I can only imagine if I receive a reply here, they will tell me to 'gather more information' about my computer and 'contact customer support'.  This paid service can't run at all properly on my Windows 10 and up-to-date Android system.  I NEVER had theses problems with Express VPN.  Nord has lost another customer they have failed to support.  Had I received at least a discount for the hours of customer support-assistance I have provided them, I would not be so certain about ending things.  Nord is selling trash as gold."

However the debit happens every month is a shocker and they say its on T&C.  My question is why cant you put that on the invoice you send \"auto renewal after 7th day of everymonth\" They dont.  It may be inbetween the 1000's of T&C wording for us to read and interpret.  This is the last thing on your mind when you travel. sneaky - Auto Subscriptions!"

I can't even get my money back for the service even though it doesn't work. I guess that's one way for them to limit the number of users accessing their servers, take their money, and then don't provide the connection. So disappointed in Nord VPN. Any recommendations for another, more reliable and responsive VPN?In reply to Nord's comment. I have used the chat and it too is frustrating because the agent asks that you try different things, many of which disconnect you from the chat."

Good bye, good riddance, cancelled my membership after over 4 years over this excrement.If I had my way this would be far less polite. Look around, I'm not the only one.[Re Reply: \"transparent\" is not good enough, I think \"forthcoming\" is warranted. Like your constant ads and pop-ups for your extra security services, NordPass and its ilk, be forthcoming about that too! And judging from what I see online you guys already know.]"

First, the speed dropped, then split tunneling, which is a key feature for me, stopped working altogether with some big popular apps.  I'm not a lazy user, if something goes wrong, I go hunting for a solution. While many people were experiencing the same problems I was. nothing was working for me. MY PC has gone through two installations and upgrades in those two years and NordVPN just refused to work properly with any of them.To make matters much, much worse, in the past year, major sites have started blocking NordVPN. I literally can't use it now. This was the last straw. I got a Black Friday deal on a different VPN and everything is working beautifully again. My hell is over and thus ends the two-year tyrannical reign of the literal worst thing I ever installed on any PC in 30+ years.STAY AWAY. NordVPN is a VIRUS at this point."

Qbitorrent is set up to  access ethernet4 as it should be etc . All in all not the best of experiences . If i were a Noob i would have been well stuck"

Since  it takes sometimes 24+ hours to get a reply, then it becomes and ongoing loop of interaction   Although there is a name attached to the response it is as if a bot is replying as my question never answered, but rather a number of help links are sent.   Customer service seems to ignore you once you have an issue.   I actually replied pleading that they answer my question rather than repeating sending the same links.  it is too bad as their customer service has driven me to a rival."

I was told you can only watch Amazon Prime in the location where your billing address is (not true in my experience traveling without VPN). The AppleTV app connected to their server(s) but would cut off every few minutes. Just a waste for me, unfortunately. They did refund my money bc they have a 30-day money back guarantee.Edit: NordVPN responded to this review within a few hours\u2014way faster than any response by their tech support.

Unfortunately, this hasn't been the case when I used their software. So I lost money - not once, but twice. I am afraid I am too trustworthy and I keep falling for the positive reviews (even though I just noticed that the ones here read like ads).The first time, a few years ago, I asked them if their service worked in China, which they confirmed before I bought a 2 year plan. When I arrived, it didn't work. Nord support then do what they do - they send you on a wild goose-chase, trying to grind you out of your demand for a refund: 'try this, now try that'. They are relentless and in the end I gave up the money to keep my sanity.Because I'm naive, I tried again recently and - surprise! - same story. This time I only bought a monthly plan, though. Again, software didn't work, 'support' does their \"before we refund we want to trouble-shoot\" which they keep up until ultimo. My advice: Don't. Just don't."

On Windows (I use Android, Windows and Linux) it is now not connecting to the country I have specified and on Android it can disconnect without notifying you and if you don't notice you can start browsing without the protection. Yet, you cannot turn off the notifications for their new products that I don't need and don't want to pay about. It is a shame that after 7 years I have to look for a new VPN."

Customer service is pretty reactive and asked me for a lot of screenshots and logs but mostly no real solution.

And I'm making sure to connect to a servers in my own country. Other than that I've been told that it's the best, and it's definitely one of those set and forget type of things. But also another problem with it is that there's a bunch of websites which you can have difficulty with when using this VPN. Like they might not allow you to go any further because of it, or they might continually look at you and say that you have got suspicious activity etc. and they'll ask for captchas etc."

On my Mac it works consistently with only some connectivity interruptions that can be solved by stopping and starting network. I also have several of the Nord suite of apps installed. Nord Pass works best and is the consistent. All portions of the suite work better on my Mac than they do on my iphone.The VPN on my iphone is nearly unusable with home automation apps as well as any bank or health app.  Productivity apps such as email, calendar, and mapping work fine most of the time. Social media apps also work fine most of the time. For me problems with any app or connection to the internet can be solved by stopping Nord VPN for a time. In the worst of cases stopping and starting WiFi or a phone restart is needed."

You actually need to restart the machine every time to be able to use it.I requested a refund during the trial period but it was not honored. The direct communication with NordVPN is not easy, since they manage their subscription through a third party, Paddle, and it ends up acting as a communication barrier between the customer and NordVPN.In justice to the product, though, once you are connected the VPN service is quite good.UPDATE: When I proved that I requested a refund on time, NordVPN refunded me the 3 months of service charged.

It felt like a safer service also.The new interface is dropping connections and turning off my settings that I have to keep reconfiguring. The new interface takes a very long time to connect to server at times. Old interface was much faster. Saving favorite servers was easier too.I kept the old interface for years and just recently thought I had to update it. I wish I hadnt!I tell my firewall to not allow some new connections from the new interface.

It warns you it isn't https then you have to click allow connection but sometimes it still won't connect. It also can stop a lot of commercial sites from loading and such. The speed on Nord is generally faster. The other annoyance is that it will sometimes take forever to connect or it just won't do it at all and have to reboot. Meshnet is a handy feature that allows large file transfers between linked devices but can be hard to figure out. In comparison Surfshark has fewer extra features but doesn't cause the same connection problems and is somewhat slower."

I got NOTHING back bar platitudes which repeated the documentation on the webpage adding nothing helpful.* Has some irritating habits including:Repeatedly telling you you need to update your card details - Despite having 15 months subscription to run&Frequently spamming you about extra cost add ons you don't want or would have signed up for in the first place* Would I have bought it knowing then what I do now?  - Yes because it does seem to work"
