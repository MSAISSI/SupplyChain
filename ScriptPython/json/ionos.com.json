Now we are speaking about legal consequences.We pay these weeks  what Ionos requested, they (IONOS)  even extended us credit notes because they charge us more than they should have, and know they are blaming Google. We don\u2019t have a direct contract with them, we have a contract with Ionos.We even call several times, not only wasting money with you but time and effort without results.We pay already two days  ago paid AGAIN for the second time an additional license, and today we received another request for the same thing??  Shame of you!  IONOS have to deal internally their business and with their providers or resellers. We us clients don\u2019t need to suffer for that and it speaks poorly of you when you blame others."

When I was buying that hosting I asked one of their agent will I get an SSL certificate for my all domain names or if I had to buy SSL for each domain name on the answer she told me that SSL would be provided with the package. I also had the audio recording of that conversation.But I bought two domains yesterday and didn't get any SSL certificate. when I called them today they said that I have to buy SSL for each of my domains specifically.Isn't it an unethical way to do business by misleading people like this?Please consider my issue as soon as you guys can otherwise I have to complain about you guys."

Not only that but the server I bought never worked right from day one and it has been nothing but a battle trying to get a working server or my money back. I requested a refund for over 8 months worth of charges on a server that did not work properly and was given $200 out of over $1000 charged. IONOS is based in Germany and they have different laws and IONOS is operating their servers under German law and have no regard for U.S Consumer laws. They charge for services they never render properly or never rendered at all. Their website has bugs in it and caused my user table to get corrupted and their response was to create a new account, rather than fix the underlying issue causing the corruption.  I will never again buy anything from this German Company and their customer support is horrendous. You call them when your hosting/services do not work and they blame the customer (I have never seen this from a hosting company before) and tell the customer the configuration of their servers, is on the end user?I am not even sure I want to leave my contract ID for fear of retaliation from IONOS. They have once already illegally locked me out of my data with no prior reasoning or communication. They did not even bother contacting me, that is not happening again. This company needs to be investigated, PRONTO!!"

Instead, they disabled my customer id. Their customer management architecture is from the 2000's.That was the last straw.Oh and they don't offer email support or at least it doesn't show up on their website. Yes, they really are a business from the 2000's.IONOS is going backwards. Good riddance really. I'm happy with porkbun."

I have since had just about every issue possible with them. Most recently Visa declined automatic payment because of a security breach they discovered with Ionos. Since automatic payment was not working we tried calling to pay over the phone. Would you believe that the company does not accept credit card payment and forces you to pay via Paypal? The other alternative is bank transfer. We transferred funds - and 10 days after the transfer, their agents were still unable to see if they had arrived. We created a paypal account especially to pay them a second time and were still told repeatedly that it would take them approx 2 business days to get back to us. In the mean time and despite payment, and our repeated calls, they cancelled our contract (how nice)... I have since spent hours on hold with their agents asking to speak to a manager is like telling them a joke. And now they want more money to retrieve our sites from backup because of the mess they created in the first place. We are agency and sent other companies to IONOS - a very painful experience that looked very bad on us. Steer clear unless you love a struggle."

However, when issues began to surface with Outlook compatibility we hit a roadblock. We\u2019ve been working on the issue with IONOS for the past 3 months and the issue remains unresolved. We understand some issues take time but what is the most disappointing is the fact that you CANNOT talk to any supervisor or  level 2 engineer, even though your issue has been assigned to them. And to be clear, we support this protocol however when an issue remains unresolved for months on end, it may make sense to pivot.  Through this experience we also realized IONOS struggles with continuity. Every call is with someone new. It would make more sense to wait until the same representative is available. IONOS offers great products/service WHEN they work. However, if you\u2019re looking for customer support and the ability to talk to a supervisor/engineer, you may be best served with another company."

After a long wait, I finally got someone on the phone and actually felt sorry for the agent having to take calls from customers angry over her employer's incompetence and fraud. She said she would take care of the problem and issue a refund, but because they didn't follow through last time, I'll believe it when I see it.

Meanwhile, IONOS still had an active order on my account for the same domain.Pathetic and unacceptable. What's the point of being able to reach live agents and having a personal \"consultant\", when they can't even do the most basic of basics?Would never recommend them for anything ever.UPDATE: After I posted this review, IONOS flagged it as fake and it was taken down. I've since provided Trustpilot with evidence everything I said was true so this review was reinstated and marked \"verified\". Just be aware that IONOS is trying to get negative reviews taken down."

At present, my domain is active at least until mid-next year, yet the \"Instant Domain\" is demanding $45 after having debited me multiple times previously. This is so unprofessional for a company like yours. I regret knowing you guys."

I do not recall at any time being made aware of any extra charges for this service. They then proceeded to set up monthly billing with a one year contract which \"they cannot cancel\" until the end of the period. I have contacted support and am yet to receive any satisfactory cancellation.UPDATE - I was called back by a supervisor who was able to cancel one of the two? Website contracts set up for the (single) domain and discount the other contract by 50%. The reason for my review is that the process does not at any point make it clear that it is charged as an extra monthly fee and with a fixed renewing contract of one year on top of that.."

When it was put to them that the domains were still available to be purchased on other domain sites their response was yes.So the effort it takes to open a business your website dreams could be taken away in 48hrs when someone buys the domain before IONOS reserve the domain. Went to GODADDY and the service was instant, the service a lot better and customer friendly. Website design I found far better.  IONOS needs to take a good look at themselves. All you are is a company that sells names and hosts websites something that I can do on a synology server. Ironically after I canceled the transaction and received refund I received email claiming the transaction had been rejected due to issue with the payment.Clearly a company that doesn\u2019t know what its doing.  Your service is poor and will not buy from you again."

While I get it, I don't. It's $16 which is not a lot and it could have easily been handled over the phone but instead they told me the only way was via paypal and a 3 day wait. Now my company and site are down for an entire weekend which are my best times for clients."

Apparently they didn't transfer all my files which caused my website to not work. After calling them they told me I would have to pay $70 to have my website restored. They are charging me for the mistakes THEY made! I couldn't believe it. It was their responsibility to transfer my files...not mine. Unfortunately I have to pay the fee because I have no other ways to get my files and database. Once my contract with them is up I will be finding a new company to host my website."

Evidently there's something going on with this company and they're having major teething problems. =======================================I have always found Ionos to be really good, I have used them for several instant domain and web hosting packages for a number of years, and they all live up to expectation and in all honesty, I can't think of any using any competitor of theirs.  Although one time, years ago, I did try using Microsoft Azure as a web hosting provider where you end up selling your sanity just to get one web page on the 'interwebs' never mind a whole site!

I kindly confirmed that this was an already cancelled contract and that IONOS support (Rulio Oscar) confirmed that invoice was cancelled. Even though, my domain was never delivered and neither refunded. I have emailed then twice since, and they are not even replying."

Which also means the rep did not listen because I specifically said windows lol.Beyond the horrbile support, I like IONOS. I like the website and the way things are setup. Their hosting webspace allows you to direct all of your domains towards specific folders that can house applications and for instance that is where our Umbraco 10 project sits, is on the webspace in a folder call 'App'. But, since it only shows .net 4 as the framework (Umbraco 10 requires at least .net 6) most of the features of my site are not working on IONOS hosting but does work on my previous hosting that I still have until the end of next month. I suggest IONOS clean up their mess and fix my hosting account before I cancel for the 30 day money back guarantee!!!"

All the while developing the site (under a temporary URL), things were quiet as I worked through the issues. It wasn't until my new domain was propagated to the web w/registration that the onslaught began. This is NOT something under the providers control. Even so, they did their best to minimize my interruptions and for that I am grateful. Since I ranted, their support staff have been great in helping me deal with the remaining issues and my site is benefitting greatly. I apologize for my prior rant and assign no blame to IONOS for the fine job they are doing. I should have realized what was actually happening but I haven't been doing any coding for about 15 years and forgot how this process works."

          "Contenu": "I've been with IONOS for years. My experience, for the most part, has been very positive. Maybe my expectations are too high...but the one area I do find a tiny bit frustrating, is what seems like IONOS inability to respond to concerns outside of IONOS defined solutions. For example, I recently expressed a concern regarding billing, and asked if it is possible to be billed annually as opposed to monthly, or, is it possible for IONOS to indicate the amount owning on the invoice, in both $USD and 4CDN dollars.  IONOS responds quickly, and very politely \u2013 but the responses are generic. IONOS seems to be unable to respond to my specific concern, if my concern falls outside of the present solutions IONOS is able to provide. That said, I would absolutely recommend IONOS: 4.73 out of 5 stars."

While I understand the necessity of use email template for fast costumer support. Use the same template for different answers type create non necessary negative and confusing experience. I hope they also expand their number of email templates in the future. If you want a very good and fast web hosting service and don't care with these two problems they have on the moment of review. So go ahead, ionos is one of bigger and better web hosting service in 2023."

Their customer support has always been available and ready, although I haven't really needed to contact them. Works great with my Github site. Their VPSes are very cheap compared to the competition, and are very reliable and work just fine for everything I throw at them. 2 cores and 6GB for only 15$ is awesome!! Only issue I have is lack of locations, and only having East Coast servers. Other than that, Ionos has been very great for hosting my game servers, and I will be back for all of my hosting needs :3"

The charges for this service were reasonable in my opinion. It has been more than a month and my site has been up on Ionos with no interruptions.  A few weeks after signing up, an aggressive salesman called me on my cell and sold me some add on services - Ranking Coach and others. I cancelled some of them right away and decided to try Ranking Coach. Overall it was helpful, however it required a lot of my time to implement changes to my site and time is short right now. When I called customer service for help they often couldn't help me with technical Wordpress maters and the wait times were not great. I also received several pushy sales pitches for more services during calls for help which I don't appreciate. It was difficult to cancel Ranking Coach. I tried canceling once and they invoiced me for another month - despite the fact that I called back per their requirements. I called a second time back they promised to cancel and waive the invoice fee. I hope it sticks this time. I intend to continue with Ionos unless problems continue. Hopefully I can give them a 5 star review at some point."

I love how I can choose the server location to different locations in Europe, I wish they had more locations in Asia though. Overall I would recommend their services the only improvements I would recommend that they make would be to add servers in Asia (like in Japan) and for people that have multiple VPS servers it would be awesome if I could consolidate multiple contracts into a single monthly payment instead of having separate $2 payments for each contract every month on my credit card."
