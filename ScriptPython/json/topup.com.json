When I responded to their e-mail I got auto replies that just kept saying the same thing over and over. When they finally called me, I got a service rep who barely spoke understandable English and just kept saying \"we need screenshot\" no matter how many times I tried to explain to her there was no way to do that. Their people aren't empowered to solve problems, they automate too many things, and ultimately they weren't usable, which is a shame since I have a lot of money to spend on top-up minutes as rewards for people.

Using same credit card with no changes, so why all of sudden would they need a pre-authorization on every purchase. 2 weeks later and still no refund. It is only a lousy $3.00, but is just a matter of principal.Finally refunded my money, so guess I will use them again."
