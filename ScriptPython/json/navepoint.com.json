          "Contenu": "I absolutely regret purchasing this product. Seems like solid construction but the screws included in the kit are nowhere near enough to mount a full rack. The spec sheet seems to specify both M6 and 12/24, which are completely different size screws. I ordered both and neither one actually fits the frame. Are the screws for this rack a non-standard size? Why would you make me figure out what screw fits? Terrible experience. I even purchased other navepoint products and even those screws don't fit on their own product!!!"

It seems that you left off the Outside Dimensions for the rack that I bought, thus it is too big.Despite your company not having the complete description of the item, you refused to pay for the return shipment.I have returned the item at my expense and have received a refund.I'm now out the freight to return it and you have lost a customer for life.Not sure if this is what you think is good business or not?Respectfully,Stacy KAUFMAN"

Only to be called a few days later that I need to pay an extra $150+ before I can have my order delivered to me because it comes in a pallet. I have had several heavier items delivered to me in a pallet by other vendors such as my media room furnitures without having to request a separate delivery fee after the fact. This is a very unprofessional behavior and one that I least expected from a Company like this. The fact I actually called them on the phone, gave all the details and they sent me a link to pay for my order online, which i did immediately; only for them to call me a few days after charging my credit card and demanding more money/delivery fee, is what is very worrisome. I would beware of this Company. I have asked that my order be fulfilled as is or canceled and refunded, but they've gone radio silent on me in the last 2-3days as of today Feb 3rd. I am currently exploring my options."

Cool! The side panels have the same issue (the lock doesn't clear the frame to lock right.) What do I do now? I take a hammer to it and bend the frame so it works correctly.I buy another unit that you have to assemble the frame. I follow the instructions but the holes for the screws aren't large enough and i have to DRILL INTO THE FRAME to make the holes bigger. Whatever. As I attach the vertical rails to mount equipment to...THE RAILS ARE TOO SHORT TO ATTACH TO THE FRAME...This company is garbage and it's a wonder how they're in business. Their products are horrible."

          "Contenu": "So I have had ok service from Navepoint in the past. Previous purchases online or on location went ok, but it was never a super good experience, so this time I tried to place my order on the phone. When I called they refused to take my order so I asked the sales rep for the part number. After I had the items purchased and paid for online with the part number I was given and had it drop shipped directly to the customer, I then found out their sales rep gave me the wrong part number. When I arrived at my client's to begin the install and seeing the wrong part was shipped I immediately called customer support. I informed Navepoint this piece had to be installed as there was fines if I missed the deadline. Navepoint being in Libertyville and I and my client were in Oak Lawn about 85 min. apart. I informed customer support what happened and they said \"I'm sorry but we will send you a tag to return it and when we receive it we will send you a new one. Keep in mind it was $150.00 a day for every day we were late so I said well in that case I will put the rack in with what I have and just bring in the pieces that are wrong next week. Feeling that was fair, again I was told \"no sorry the only way to do it was the way previously stated\" I then said I could send a courier out with the parts and they would not agree to that either. I then demanded to speak to a sales manager and she told me they could not possibly do that. Getting no where, I then asked for the owner Russ. I had dealt with him over wrong parts they had sent me in the past and according to the sales manager Russ was not in the building, how ever not 45 seconds later he was there letting me know that this was not his fault. Yet I informed him his sales team gave me the wrong number but mistakes happen right. I would never never by any thing from them again. The sales people don't tell the truth, the sales manager lies and they never take responsibility for their mistakes. I have a lot of friends in the IT business and put it on Facebook. I received  25 phone calls from that and more than half of them agreed with what I said. People think if you open a business people will just beat down your door with sales but it is a relationship you build with customers that makes them want to deal with you. I think this is an example of what not to do.I called another vendor they had one delivered to my in 3 hours and they were cheaper than Navepoint. Since then I have spent over $3500.00 in three weeks at the new vendor"

Unfortunately the job we were on timing was crucial as we were wiring a movie theater and waiting for screws when the should have already been sent is unacceptable. We may buy NavePoint again in the future, but as a brand and customer service they definitely didn\u2019t win us over as solid customers going forward. Still in the hunt for that company."

I told them I won't be in the office on 10/20 and emailed Wills Freight 3 count it 3 contact names with cell phone & lan line numbers. I came back on 10/21 to hear a voicemail message from the shipping company saying they're trying to contact me after all the info I gave them. I left a message for the driver and still haven't heard back. Not good for business. For this reason cheapest isn't always the best route.

After five attempts I figured out a method that would allow me to close the front door with the back door mounted and using my existing slides.  This configuration unfortunately does not work with the three shelves or the middle support brackets shipped with the cabinet. They are very shallow compared to the depth of the cabinet. Assembly has been a very frustrating and time consuming experience.  This is not my first rack installation, but I hope it is my last. Update:  I did receive my replacement brackets and they sent an extra one for some reason."

However, if you are needing something shipped expeditiously, please read all of the fine print regarding 1 day, 2 day shipping before purchasing because 2 day shipping, could in fact turn out to be more like 5 days depending on the time of the day you place an order, the fact that weekend days do not count as shipping days, and if there is a holiday on a Monday or a Friday that does not count either, so buyer beware because you may end up shelling out hundreds of dollars to get a product shipped quickly, only to find out you won't get it when you expect.  This opinion sounds like personal experience, and it is.  I will hand it to Navepoint in that they refunded part of my shipping cost when this scenario unfolded for me after a bit of arm twisting.  I would like to see the shipping details more prominently displayed especially when 1 or 2 day shipping is being selected.  I understand we are all responsible for ourselves, but the buying experience here with regard to shipping can be improved in my view."

Small parts like headphone adapters roll to the back and you need a tool to extract them.  In today's age all quality drawers should have full extension, especially on a drawer this shallow.  Nice product, but I'll be looking to replace the drawer slides.Edit:  4 Stars to 3 Stars - I wondered why NavePoint is selling the same product listed in multiple categories with different pricing.  After posting my review I see others have confirmed this unethical pricing."

Once assembled, the enclosure is pretty decent. Next time I have to purchase another enclosure, i\u00b4ll go for the Pro series. Seems to be better built and sturdier."

I was able to bend the shelf back to useful shape, but of course, some of the paint chipped off and had to be touched up.To NavePoint's credit, they quickly offered to either a) replace the item, or b) give me a discount for the damage.  Because I could not wait for a replacement in this situation, I took the discount.I would be inclined to give them another try at a later time."

When I called CS to report the shortage, they were largely incredulous that the 50 pack of hardware was not in the box, even insisting that I \"look carefully\" in the box once more to make sure they weren't really there. I did not appreciate their disbelief or condescension. They DID ship a replacement bag of hardware, but the experience really made me question their commitment to customer service. How can they NOT KNOW HOW TO PROPERLY TAPE A BOX???"

Packing arrived damaged, metal is bent or will not align, and poor set up instructions were the most troubling. The alternative was something double, or more, in price with not great reviews. I ordered the product. All of the issues in the reviews are accurate. The package was damaged, but not terribly. The parts inside were protected well, so I don't think they were damaged in transit. The instructions were for a much smaller unit and did not have instructions for all of the parts included on my unit. It wasn't enough of a problem to keep me from getting it assembled. There were bent and scratched parts and the door will not stay closed without being latched. All of these issues are preventable with a little more quality control before shipping. One design feature change I would like to see is a removable back panel similar to the side panels. Overall, the online reviews are correct, but not necessarily bad enough to make it a bad purchase. If you can work with the issues, buy it. If you want perfection pass."

          "Titre": "Site states free shipping - but be advised",
          "Contenu": "Update: 7/18/2018I have yet to receive a follow up from Navepoint as to why my package was shipped via Fedex home service - when being delivered to a work (non residential) address. Their customer service rep said she would get back to me and has yet to do so as of this update. Update: 6/28/2018I was contacted my NavePoint Customer Service. They expressed  that they intend to investigate this matter. I still don't have an answer as to why my parcel was sent using FedEx Ground to Home service - which effectively took my parcel hostage from me. I remain hesitant to order any new racks from the NavePoint site until I know what happened to my parcel and what their new shipping process and timeline is to resolve this matter moving forward. NavePoint is going to send me some additional rack screws (thanks NavePoint - I do appreciate that). In response to my question as to why they don't provide that many screws. 1. The rack I ordered was a starter kit and comes with minimal screws. To that I said, the rack should include enough screws to accommodate mounting 6 (six) 1U items. The CS rep said she will pass that comment onto the product team. 2. They assume that network equipment providers provide their own mounting screws in the box with their equipment. I advised the CS rep that there are at least 2 different U.S. and 2 different Metric thread size standards. Assuming that the mounting screws provided by the network equipment manufacturer will fit the NavePoint rack is an incorrect assumption. The CS rep said she will pass that comment onto the product team.  I will provide updates to this review as they become available. I am updating the rating based on their effort to call me and express interest in correcting the matter. +++++++Original ReviewSite states free shipping - however - doesn't declare the shipping method used. In my case, Navepoint chose to use FedEx ground to home delivery - which only delivers Tuesday through Saturday. My parcel was scheduled for delivery on Saturday to my company, which is closed on Saturday. When I contacted FedEx to have the package re-routed, I was told there was nothing they could do (I could not have the package routed to a FedEx facility, FedEx retail location, scheduled for a Monday pickup at a FedEx location). It was hostage to FedEx.  To make matters worse, they said it would not be delivered on Monday either - as the \"shipper\" used a home delivery (Tuesday through Saturday) shipping method. I ordered this with plenty of time to be delivered to the SF bay area without falling into the day of the week trap. I needed this rack for a network install. I'm disappointed with both Navepoint and FedEx for having put me into this experience. One small win however. The parcel was unexpectedly delivered to me on Monday (even though FedEx emphatically told me it wasn't going to be delivered to me). This enabled me to complete my network install the following Tuesday AM. I would have to think long and hard before I order anything from Navepoint again. There are other options.- I may consider paying extra for proper shipping on/from Navepoint site- I can purchase the item(s) through Amazon (which costs more, but comes with Prime shipping. - Alternatively, I can order products from either Monoprice or PI Manufacturing - both of which have reliable shipping processes.   The FedEx home delivery shipping method is the worst - ever. They just don't care.Other items of noticeable concern. Navepoint only provides like12 screws for their 6U rack. That's only enough to mount 3 (three) 1U items. How about a few more screws folks, they're like .002 cents each. I have come across machining issues with the threads on some of their racks. I've mentioned this to them before. Never heard anything back. Nothing like being out in the field only to find that some of the screw-holes are not properly threaded.I'm giving this review 2-stars as I realize the issues with FedEx are not entirely Navepoints problem."

It supports my newer, bigger AV receiver very well and greatly improves access to the rear connections. The only technical issue: The shelf tends to slide forward because of the inherent springiness of the cables/wires in the rear. This happens even though I have right-angle banana plugs terminating all speaker wiring and have generally organized the wiring pretty well. It would be good to have a magnetic catch to keep the drawer stationary when it's all the way in."

I opened it up to find that there was no manual, no casters, no cage nuts, nor any M6 nuts or bolts to assemble it. I called support and they quickly sent out a complete package of hardware at no cost to me and I had it within two days.

It would be nice to offer an option for quieter fans or to be able to change the fan speed, but as far as convenience, these do the job well.

They are really hard to work with even with cat5 cable.  They are not a bad product, just really tight.  You really have to squeeze the cables into them.  Other than that everything else was amazing.  High quality shielded cable, the wire baskets are more sturdy than any I have ever worked with.  I would for sure recommend them to anyone who needs to have quality products for a pretty unbeatable price."

I selected the NavePoint 15U 600mm Depth Wallmount Networking Cabinet (Professional Series) and 2 NavePoint Fixed Vented Shelves for 600mm Cabinets.Unfortunately, some of my cabinet parts were damaged in shipment. I would have rejected the 86-pound shipment, but the box only appeared to be slightly damaged. NavePoint customer service requested photos of the damaged parts and promptly shipped the replacement parts to me at no cost. It was that simple, yet impressive.The cabinet build instructions were clear and the fit and finish met my expectations, which are higher than most as I work for a global information technology firm. The finished cabinet is a show piece and houses network, surveillance and smart home equipment. My NavePoint experience, start to finish, was great. I would not hesitate to recommend NavePoint to a friend or colleague.This was a personal purchase at full price for home use. I am in no way affiliated with NavePoint.-James"
