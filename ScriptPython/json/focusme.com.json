          "Contenu": "I was on the two week trial, it's possible this would be a different experience outside the trial.During the trial, the app was doing exactly what I needed it to. During the schedule I set, it would prevent gaming and random video/social media surfing, letting me actually have a reasonable sleep schedule. It would pause and hide these apps, but I wouldn't lose progress, and it was very consistent and reliable.The day after my trial ended, the app popped up with a login screen. I attempted to login, the app interface would just lock up, and then randomly apply a schedule for a different time to my computer. Closing/ending the app of course didn't solve the problem, because it is (wisely) designed to relaunch if you try to play fast & loose with it. The only way to make my computer functional after the trial ended was to uninstall the app entirely (Thank goodness I didn't turn on the uninstall protection).In theory, this app is pretty good, and does what it says. But if there's a problem this early into it's use that causes the computer to essentially not work, it seems like a very dangerous app to use or rely on. Disappointing, really...so much potential, but can't be trusted."

          "Contenu": "First the good thing: your product leads the field in unhackability.  Cold Turkey is too easy to disable from the command line, and Freedom is so bad it's barely worth mentioning.  So you are leading this particular niche area of software.  Also, you've been helpful and quick to respond to criticism/offer technical support in the past.What's wrong with your software: it's buggy.  I can't count the number of times it's simply stopped working for no reason.  Or there's been a delay before a list would activate.  Or the fact, that, despite being set to activate at midnight, my plans activate at 4am.Your UI is bad.  There is no reason why, when editing a plan, it should be necessary to cycle through 5 or 6 screens in a linear fashion just to get to the one that I want.  This is particularly true because your program consistently freezes for a few seconds on the second screen of settings.  If you are going to make a UI this annoying, you should at least not be having glitches that cause your program to freeze.  Unforeseen stuff like this is why you should have good UI, a combination of a bug + poorly conceptualized UI makes the bugs even more annoying than they have to be.Secondly, there is no good way to import massive blocklists into plans, too large a copy paste buffer doesn't work and copy paste is the worst way to do this anyways.  You should preserve the copy paste option, but take a page from Cold Turkey and allow for the importation of blocklists in .txt files.Finally, your product, like all \"Ulysses Software\" should employ a \"rabbit snare\" principle - be hard to hack, but easy to make more restrictive.  It should be easy to add to blocklists during a locked plan.  The best example of this feature is Cold Turkey, which has a browser extension which allows the addition of any URL to a blocklist with a couple clicks.  As far as I can tell, the FocusMe browser extension doesn't do anything.  If you really want to one up Cold Turkey, make it possible to edit the browser URL when you're adding it, in order to add wildcards.Your product is a frustrating combination of power and immense, untapped potential.  I don't know if there is some deep tradeoff of bugginess you had to accept to get the level of unhackability you have, but the UI stuff could be easily fixed.I also eagerly wait a viable android version of your product, as I currently deal with smartphone by simply uninstalling all social media apps, browsers, and finally the store itself, to make sure I can't reinstall anything."

          "Contenu": "While I like the android app, the windows desktop app has an unintuitive UI and I have been unable to configure it for my needs, and keeps showing recurring bugs like maximize button being disabled.  So while the windows app has powerful features, I am unable to actually use them, e.g. to whitelist certain sites only for a set of hours every day including important emails (in gmail) but not other emails.UI issues:1. Usage of column heading like RULE instead of something more user friendly.2. The actual value for RULE is truncated in length and have to hover over it to see the full text (note: this problem would go away if maximize button or resizing of window works).  But ideally, I would like to increase width of only RULE column.3. Not sure how whitelist works. If I give a few sites to whitelist, then I expect that timer should run if any websites apart from these whitelisted websites are being used.  But on usage, it seems I have to enter some blacklisted sites also and only then the timer will run.  In that case, it is not clear how to blacklist all websites except whitelisted ones.4. The settings for a plan makes you jump sequentially through 6 dialog windows, when it could have been made into tabbed or a more compressed kind of UI with ability to set multiple parameters on same window.5. Sometimes, the settings will result in a window being blocked when I do not think it should have been as per my configured parameters.All in all, I have spent quite some time but unable to configure it for my needs.  I will probably wait till the UI and settings are improved."

I would definitely recommend this for people with a serious procrastination problem, like myself."

          "Contenu": "This is the most robust and fully featured distraction blocker of the ones I've tried. Flexibility in terms of scheduling (timer, specific hours of the day, no. of app/website launches etc.) and the level of security of the block (password protection, incl. randomly generated char. sequences, or a \"nuclear\"/forced mode) are essential to making it a good long-term solution that reduces stress instead of adding it. I've been really impressed with the forced mode (i.e., the one you can't turn off at all).Customer service is also great, in my experience. My license was auto-renewed, but the old one expiring meant that the app logged me out and stopped the plans that were running. I created a support ticket in panic on Friday afternoon and didn't expect to hear from them until Monday/Tuesday, but got a response within just a few hours, which means that I have a much higher chance of staying productive throughout this weekend.All in all, for me, it's definitely worth the asking price and I want to strongly encourage any ADHD brains out there (or anyone with less-than-stellar executive function, really) to take FocusMe for a spin and see if it works well for them.There are some downsides to be aware of, though: - the interface could use a touch-up; right now it's sometimes a little confusing even for me and I consider myself tech-savvy (don't let it scare you away from trying the app, though -- a few minutes of clicking every button you see should be enough to help you orient yourself);- on a related note, the license renewal issue described a few paragraphs above... simply should not have happened -- I'd expect the license reactivation to be automated and not stop active plans (upd.: Jon Rumens reached out to me and explained that the expected behaviour is indeed auto-reactivation, so, while the reason it didn't trigger in my case is still shrouded in mystery, I thought I'd downgrade this particular point from \"a feature not thought out\" to \"a weird bug that was surprising to FocusMe team as much as it was for me\");- the mobile app has not been working great for me, unfortunately -- to the point where sometimes the apps that were supposed to be blocked simply weren't. I suspect this is something that could be resolved with more tinkering, but I simply put the mobile app aside at some point. Most of my deathscrolling happens on PCs anyway + Android has a decent digital wellbeing app that works well enough for me.So yeah, while there are definitely things about FocusMe that feel janky and seem to require more manual tuning than should be necessary, but on the flip side you do get a very robust and flexible system that can't be fooled by simply killing the process / opening a browser window in incognito mode / restarting the PC."

My only critique is that, when I've set it to restrict some websites/apps to a certain time length per day (ie: only use Youtube for 1 hour per day), sometimes it doesn't accurately record the amount of time I spend on those websites/apps, and allows me a lot more time on them then what I've programmed.

Recommended!"

Let me finish ;-).  I love FocusMe because it is hands down the most effective control I have found over the many distractions to which I previously allowed myself to fall prey; and I hate FocusMe when I feel inclined to procrastinate because I simply can not find a way to break it.  And believe me, I've tried.  I quickly became adept at breaking the other apps in its class but FocusMe has me beat, making it entirely effective at helping me focus on what I need to focus on.The only thing holding back the 5th star here is that the UX is a little clunky, and it lacks the ability to synchronise and control plans across my multiple devices.  I believe that feature and improved UX are on their way, so I look forward to continued improvements in this fantastic product."

          "Contenu": "Focus Me is flexible to set up, with many options to specify the precise controls needed for focus on what is truly important. Important is the fact that once set up, it is really difficult to change settings. It ships me just seeing what is happening on Twitter, or on the news, and suddenly it is the end of the day and I've done nothing. It's exactly what I need.The Android version isn't as high functioning, which is a shame. It also has some difficulties specific to certain phones. We have a Huawei, an OPPO and a Samsung in the house, and we have difficulty in the first two cases but not on the Samsung. That isn't the fault of Focus Me, but it's a shame. I need to restart the app more often than I'd like, and I can lose focus because of it. Purchasing the app was a bit less obvious, as I didn't get a message telling me I'd been successful, and purchased two. Customer service are excellent, however, and I received an immediate refund on one. They were also good and responsive with some of the technical problems with the Android version, which is not wholly successful but due to Huawei peculiarities rather than the app.Very strongly recommend the computer version, and I how the Android version develops a little more."

It is totally unmatched. I'd rate it 9 out of 10 if I could. 4/5 is not doing it justice. I absolutely love FocusMe. The software is so extraordinarily intelligent, sophisticated, smart, robust and indestructible. No filter system in the world comes anything even close to FocusMe on the PC. Literally none.Want to block the TV show \"Big Brother\", but don't want to block the words big and brother individually? Focus Me lets you do that. Want to block the word videos, but want to allow the phrase 'Maths videos'? Focus Me lets you do that. Want to block Bing Images and Videos, but not Mail, Maps, Flights, OneDrive? Focus Me lets you do that. Want to time-limit how long you spend on a search engine, or searching on YouTube?  Focus Me lets you do that. I mean it's just so exceptionally smart. NOW the ONLY thing that I'm disappointed with Focusme is that, the blockage isn't as instantaneous! So if I attempt to search something I've blocked, there's a delay of 2 seconds before it's blocked. That's probably not a problem for many users. But for me, if that 2 seconds is enough to expose me to images which I can't forget about."

          "Contenu": "I'm still learning to use it and like it overall, but so far I'm having issues with functions on the desktop version. For a couple social media sites, I chose to only allow 3 launches per day of 15 minutes per launch with a minimum of 4 hours between launches. I also set up a window of time in the day when that is supposed to be active. However, it doesn't keep track of the time between launches when the computer is not on (so if I have 2 hours left before I can launch my \"second time for the day,\" but then I close my computer and come back to it a few hours later, it still says I have 2 hours left before I can launch again). It also is not keeping track of the number of launches per day, it just cycles through 1, 2, and 3 over the course of multiple days rather than restarting at 1 each day (including not counting the break time while the computer is off...so if I open my computer in the morning, I may have time left in a \"break\" even though it's a new day). Hard to explain, but basically, it's not working like I think it should based on how I set it up and I need to figure it out (which is a tall order since the desktop app is kind of clunky and hard to understand at first). TLDR: Good concept, but the details are not super intuitive or seamless in function. Still think it will be good to use for the year once I figure it out"

That was 5 years later than intended, but hey. Better late than never!I don't think I could have done it without FocusMe. Digital distractions are productivity death by a thousand cuts. Silicon Valley pays brain scientists millions to make their products as addictive and distracting as possible. I\u2019ve tried just about all other distraction blockers on the market, but they are easily circumvented. FocusMe has a \u201cforced\u201d mode \u2013 you WILL get your work done.I'm an evangelist for this program. I always tell everyone about it. In this day and age, unless you have the willpower of a Tibetan Temple Elder, you may not even realize how many countless hours get lost every day, seeping through the cracks, seconds and minutes at a time. Unnoticed. Adding up to years of your life.How much is it worth to get your life back? To finally get around to all the things you've been putting off for years? A million dollars? I don't know. What I do know is that I can't possibly recommend this program highly enough. FocusMe I want your autograph! If you were a woman I'd marry you. If I was a woman I'd want your baby."

I set an intention - literally set it in FocusMe... and I then have to follow through. Once you set the app on force mode, you cannot stop it. This feature is so good for me because I 'would' turn it off otherwise. I just wish there was an app like this for my diet, my budget, my whole life lol...But overall- it 'is' training my discipline muscles too - so I think it really will help me all round. I love it"

          "Contenu": "I have tried many apps to help with digital distractions, but I always find loopholes. FocusMe is the one app that I just can't get around. After a few months of using it, I found the \"Emergency Stop\" feature. Essentially, you have to email the support team for a code. I was a bit worried because suddenly it seemed easy to stop strict blocks. However, the team offered to add a time delay for any future \"emergency stop\" requests, which I set to three days, more than enough time for willpower to kick in. It works with most browsers, but there are a bunch of niche productivity browsers that are not natively supported. Luckily, you can add these to the Application block list to avoid getting sneaky. Overall, I'm very happy with the app and it's well worth the monthly subscription fee. If you are serious about cutting out digital distractions, FocusMe is the only real choice."

I had tried other focus apps before but tended to find loopholes to exploit and disliked their singled-minded approach (usually, the only options are to block or not block websites/applications). FocusMe fixes many of these issues, with other options, like time limits and breaks. I have yet to bypass the program and only occasionally found bugs. FocusMe fixes them quickly or provides me with alternative actions.The interface, at times, can be a little confusing, and some of the functions I never use. However, FocusMe has been very actively pushing to improve the program.Overall, I am pleased with FocusMe. It has effectively forced me to start doing more productive things with my time!"

I would easily pay 5-10 dollars/month for this. Thank you."

It's an extremely powerful and intelligent tool. You just can't cheat this software. Once installed and activated, this software will act like a strict teacher that will go above and beyond to fix you. P.S. - I would recommend using Mindfulness techniques along with this app. Don't completely rely on the software. This is because once that strong urge comes back, your mind will go extremely crazy. In that particular moment, you need some techniques to calm yourself down, and mindfulness will help you in that situation. Also, you can make this app Super Strict if you want. Check its advanced settings and enable the features accordingly to your needs. This app has saved my life and I will recommend it to all those people who are infected by Digital Distraction."

I wanted to take control of my time, and FocusMe was a really good solution. FocusMe differed from other products because it handled the entire scope of the problem: 1) lock out specific programs, websites, and social media from my kids, 2) lock out some of the same stuff from me, 3) not interfere with special internet use (like GitHub, or work related youtube), and 4) to provide a range of solutions for partial lockout, by time, location, overall usage, multiple password schemes, etc.  And lastly, they do a really good job protecting the software from anyone who might trying to hack around it, including myself."
