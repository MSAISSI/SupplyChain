I haven\u2019t heard from them at all. The customer service agent said that it was probably just a 24hr authorization hold and would go away, but it\u2019s been over 48hr and it\u2019s still there. Do not trust this company."

I made multiple large purchases over $1000 which IdentityForce never caught.  I even took out a loan for $22,000 which IdentityForce didn't catch until 5 weeks later.  I'm confident that this service is one of the worst available as they have proven that they are not actively motoring anything.   Spend your money elsewhere."

I don't need seminars, what I need is protection and I'm not getting it. They are very efficient in charging my credit card on time, however, They really have no effect when it comes to protecting my identity. I canceled my membership today however, they refused to refund the bulk of my payment. The customer service rep told me when I called that she would refer me to a specialist that would call me within the hour. That was four hours ago and still no call. I am filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau and a fraud case with the credit card company. Be aware that this company is excellent at taking your money and not much else."

          "Contenu": "On Friday, 9/10 I bought the Indentity Force Credit Secure Plus for my family.  I received the activation email and when I tried to set up my account it failed.  I called Identity Force for technical support and all I was told is that there is no support available and they would put in a ticket.  Being rather upset that an online company had no technical support and that I had to wait for a call 30 minutes after purchasing the product I called to cancel.  The customer service rep could only create a ticket.  So less than 3 hours after purchasing a service that I could not access or get support for I had to wait for my refund to be processed by a separate rep.  On Sunday, 9/12 I got a call from a very nice young lady, who tried to help me get logged in.  The first time it failed and with no support the best she could do is cancel and try to create a new account.  We tried again for the second time to log in and it failed.  The best this young lady could offer was to either open a ticket for tech support or cancel.  I chose to cancel.  She told me a platform migration was happening and that glitches were occurring, which I understand.  However, to have no technical support for your product during a migration and known issues is mind numbing and just horrible for the customer and the rep.  Shame on this company for the way they run an online system and the fact there is zero technical support beyond waiting for a call.  I know nothing will change, but if I can't get through the basic account activation, what makes me think you can protect my family and I along with our data.9/14 - As you see by the response from Identity Force, they admit they are openly overwhelmed and the a world class experience is just buzz word.  What would my coming back do if I can't get logged in or technical support is overwhelmed.  I see nothing here to make me want to return as you've offered nothing other than excuses."

          "Contenu": "I was a multi-year subscriber to IdentityForce service, and was satisfied with its monitoring and reporting.  While reporting is useful, the primary reason for having the service was to get a rapid response and assistance to understand and resolve a breach or other security-related issue. That type of support tops every other product benefit, because there's no point being alerted to a credit-related or identity-related problem if assistance is not readily available.  Thus the low score.When I called to follow up on an alert about my primary credit card, the agent told me she would send the matter to someone who would respond by phone within 24 to 48 hours.I was shocked that I had to await a phone call for as long as 2 days for details about the problem and how to resolve it, so I made certain I understood what she was saying.  When that process was confirmed, I asked to speak to a supervisor or directed to another phone number.  She said the number I had dialed was the only process available, my only option was to wait for a call.That same day I enrolled in an another identity monitoring service.If you expect to receive prompt assistance for an identity-related problem I recommend searching for a company that actually cares as much about assisting its customers, as it does touting its services in its advertising.  After enrolling I have called my new service numerous times for assistance.   Each time, their 800 number has been answered immediately or within 2 minutes, with US-based agents who are extremely helpful and courteous. I waited awhile to post this review because I didn't want to overreact. I'm doing it because I think the issue is important enough to share my experience with others."

On signing up I had some questions. I was put on hold and then placed on a call back wait list (2X). It has been over 24 hours with no call back from either attempt. This morning I called the same line I did for initial information and explained I could not get any assistance and was given a 866 #. I did get a person who was rude and condescending. So far not very impressed with the service as none of my questions were answered."

These accounts were all logged into and 'verified' by identity force  and some work fine on the daily transaction pull.3. The system does not pull daily transactions on the Bank and Credit Card Activity report. I am sure all these issues are related.I also would a credit of free month(s) in my account equally the amount of time it takes you to correct the issues. At this point I believe you might have a good system, but not being able to pull the transaction and balance info on my accounts is starting to make me doubt / trust that I am being protected. I mean after all, my  Quicken program pulls this info flawlessly."

If a site isn\u2019t functional, and I can\u2019t get anyone to respond, it\u2019s doubtful that I should be able to trust the company to protect me. Sickening. I regret signing up, and I want my money back.Edit: March 1,2022:One week from my original email, and still no response. IdentityForce requested info, through Trustpilot, after my original review. I provided my info and member ID, as there wasn\u2019t a reference number. That was Friday morning. So they would have had Friday and Monday (if only counting weekdays) to contact me. That didn\u2019t happen, either. Trustpilot: I have the emails, and I have proof of membership. I would like to show that this is a verified review, if you can let me know how to send the info."

For example, I subscribe to their sexual offender monitoring report. The report shows 30 registered sex offenders near my address; however, it is  He same 5 people listed 6 separate times. Second, if these reports are incorrect, then what sorts of discrepancies are in their other reports. Third, the base subscription does not provide access to all features and reports. Many reports require additional costs to upgrade for the service to be fully functional. For example, the basic service allows you to monitor credit cards but you are only allowed to monitor five credit cards.  The ability to monitor more cards is an \u201cadd-on.\u201d"

I had called several times into your customer service to no avail, and finally when I got through, I was on hold for over 2 hours but didn't get anybody on the call. I did get a call later today when the rep changed authentication to email but suggested \"it's only one-time change to use email for authentication\". It should be up to me as the account owner, whether I want to use phone or email for authentication and my account should not have been set up for phone authentication with old phone #.

Alert says click on \"credit bureau dispute form link\" on my credit report which is  no where to be found on my dashboard.  Also having website issues trying to \"verify my account\" so I can activate the delete alert, but can't get a response by email.  Tried to call regarding billing issues, left call back number and was never called back.  On hold for 25 minutes before being able to talk to someone about this so not calling back about that.  Doesn't make me feel very secure if I get notified about a theft issue that I need to discuss with these folks!UPDATE: I got a call today from Identity Force and resolved my issues. Wendy explained that since the Equifax breach they have been inundated with calls, which is understandable. I also found a voice mail returning my request for a call back, albeit 2 days later, but called back. I do think it's sad that the only way I was able to speak with anyone was to leave a negative review, but in light of the Equifax information I'm willing to give this company another try."

I used to have a great ID guard that alerted me if somebody was using my SSN to open a bank account or something.  This only monitors existing items, which I already do on my own.  Then when I got an SSN alert yesterday, saying my SSN had probably been compromised, I got a report that gave me no information (literally, just my SSN) and \"If you have questions contact us at _\" and it was blank.  So I tried calling the 1-877 number and four times was immediately put into a \"the number you have called is unavailable.  Please leave a message.\"  There is no way, that sounds more suspicious than the spam phone calls I get.  Finally, I got through and the recording said that my estimated hold time was 56 minutes.  It gave me the option to leave a callback number, which I did, and I did not receive a call back until about 7PM that night, approx. 5 hours later.  I was busy, so I didn't pick up, so I never did resolve the issue.  I'm not dealing with that again.  For $13 a month I expect better service than that.  Now I'm trying to cancel and can't figure out how to do that either!"

If I hover over one of he provided services (like American Express) I can see the java script it's trying to run: Run script \"invokegotologinform('12')\"Seeing that and not being able to actually find my bank is a bad experience. So is the lack of high resolution images on all your buttons. The 'close window' button as well as the image buttons for 'edit' and 'activate' are low resolution and look bad on my retina display monitor. This is something that was forgivable a few years ago, but in 2018 tells me you don't update your site very often. Even low end computers have high-resolution screens.Oh, I'm also not crazy about using 2-factor over SMS. If you take security seriously you would know that SMS is easily hackable / with a little bit of social engineering and a call to a cellphone carrier. Maybe use something like Authy? I don't know, just spitballing, but I shouldn't have to. Anyway seeing little cracks like this don't actually instill me with confidence in this service. I just signed up for a year of this. Hope to see things improve."

You should, at least, offer a discount for the first year of service if you want your customers to tolerate the new \"features\" of your website. My first hint came when I filled out my profile. Near the end of the process you are suppose to acknowledge the \"Terms and Conditions\" but the link didn't work, so I couldn't review them. Then, even if I had the chance the review the \"Terms and Conditions\" the check-off box was apparently invisible. Only after working with Shyesha (sp?) and going thru the profile three times did we realize the \"bug\".BTW - after you give Shyesha (sp?) a raise for her professionalism I suggest you get her a nice, quiet office nearby. When I worked with her it was really hard to understand her because of the lively conversations going on in the background.So far, in the first 24 hours I have received two alerts, of which only one could be read on the website - the other never loads. There are other bugs - to many to mention - especially as a paying client. I had a friend who owned a successful crane company. He use to say that when he arrived at a job site he could tell immediately, based on the condition of jobsite, what an operators financial books looked like. Right now your website is not projecting a good image for IdentityForce. I only hope your website is secure and my personal data is actually protected."

The Fraud Alert Reminder is poorly worded for someone who already has a Fraud alert in effect.  I would like a reminder, but not starting today, because I didn't set my Fraud alert today. But I didn't know that was going to happen.  I clicked the ONLY button available, which was Set my fraud alerts. When I saw that took me to Expedian, I closed that tab (since I already have an alert) and went back and now I had another link I could click on \"I set my fraud alert, remind me in 90 days.\" That is true for me - I did set it - 2 months ago. So I clicked on THAT thinking it would give me a way to enter the date I set my fraud alert. But it didn't - it just says \"okay, we'll remind you in 90 days.\" Well that's not right. So I called the phone number to have the reminder either taken off or made so they could change the date, and the woman I spoke to said she couldn't do that. That it was impossible. I think that's unbelievably lame. I'm sure I'm not the only person to sign up for a new IdentityForce account who already has a Fraud Alert in affect. So far, on my first day, I'm not impressed with the IdentityForce experience because 1) that ought to be easy to fix; and 2) the woman on the phone was just not helpful right up front. Since I previously had an experience with a different identity service, I know what their customer service was like, and this one was much worse. And I switched because the reviews for IdentityForce are much better. If I had known that your customer service was worse, I wouldn't have changed.  It's my free 30 days - I still might."

When I contacted customer service to see if adjusting/limiting the time period was possible the CSRep was incredibly unsympathetic and acted as though I was an inconvenience in even bothering to call him with my question and directed me to login and turn them off.  When I asked how to do so he let out a very audible sigh of disgust and then gave me a brief and abrupt explanation of how to do so.  I had no idea that may calling for information and a request from a service that I subscribe to and pay for would be so ill received.

Both myself and my wife purchased the Ultrasecure + Credit package, and I was told on the phone those items are not on our account because because we signed up under the Equifax Breech discount.  This is an unacceptable answer because I was purchasing the \"Ultrasecure + Credit\" package, not the Equifax Breech version of the \"Ultrasecure + Credit\".  If I knew that was the case, I would have paid the full purchase price.  It makes me wonder what other services I am missing.  I hope this is just a technical issue that can be resolved easily.  I was impressed with your service at first, and I don't want to start having doubts that I should have went with another provider.  Thank you for you time."

One of the questions was not one that I chose, so it would not allow me to change my password.  I have been trying for the past 3 days to get this fixed, and every time I FINALLY talk to someone it's not their department and they are going to refer to someone.  I have talked with 3 departments so far. I was only trying to protect myself because on Sunday, someone tried to get a credit card in my name with my social security number. I told them this, and they were going to have that department call me back and help me with this, but no call back.  At this point, I just want my money back and I will go elsewhere. When I told them this today, she told me that department will call me back.  We will see.9-27 - After my review, I received a response from Identity Force and had all issues resolved.

I've added and activated every possible item I can think of (lost wallet, transaction monitoring, bank accounts, etc.) but cannot seem to get to 100%.  It doesn't tell you what else you are missing to get to 100%.2.  The credit scores lack information.  It doesn't tell you anywhere that I can find what model was used to determine the score.  My FICO scores are 821, 829, 831.  These scores came in at 798, 784, 771.  They should provide what information on what types of scores these are (FICO, Vantage Score, their own model, etc.)."

I assumed that meant that the change of password had failed, but when I tried to log back in, my \"old\" password no longer worked, but my new one did. So now it appears that the only \"fix\" needed has to do with the red warning comment during the process of changing the password.  Thanks,  Bill"

Their costumer service only work during the day so it was quite dificult to comunicate if you are a busy person during the day, had to call a few times, the good thing is that they work on saturday. Even tho I went one day over the trial period they refunded the money with no too much problem or questions. I decided to test the speed of the alert system by posting some big transactions on my bank accounts, but I received the alerts 2 days after, that what got me a bit worried since I really need something faster.Even tho it did not work for me I think this could work great for many other people."

          "Contenu": "It would improve the signup and account configuration is you added some mouse-over popups and hint messages on the entry screens.  We had to reason out some of the formats that the entry screens would allow through quite a bit of trial and error.  There were no error explanations to assist us, just an inability to proceed to the next step. For example your password entries on the account tracking allow pasting but reject the use of this without any explanation.  This results in confusion why a valid tracking password is not recognized.  A simple hint would resolve this.  Similarly the tracking account entries do not succeed if the financial institution has your account setup with two-factor authentication since there is not an opportunity to respond to the second validating code needed.  We had to remove the two-factor authentication on our bans and credit unions to allow us to setup IdentityForce.  The use of CLOSE WINDOW to accept and submit entries is a bit confusing since this button is more commonly used to exit a window that accept an entry.  Perhaps a SUBMIT or SAVE labelled button would be better combined with an alternative CANCEL button.We like some of the features and the layout of some of the site.  For example, the Services table is powerful and simple.  It would be improved by the use of hints as mentioned above."

          "Titre": "Maybe better wording on email alerts?",
          "Contenu": "I just started using my trial subscription and will likely continue.  But a few thoughts struck me today...I received my very first two IdentityForce emails on my iPhone while happily shopping with my wife at Costco.  The subject lines read: \"Smart SSN Tracker...\" and \"Sex Offender Monitoring Update\".    I glanced at the \"Sex Offender\" email and saw: \"...while this does not necessarily mean you are a victim of identity theft...\"  OMG!  Immediately, I think: \"Crap!  Someone on the Dark Web stole my SSN and they've dragged my identity into some sort of sex crimes!\"  This hung over my head like a cloud until I could get home and visit the provided links.   How thrilled I was to discover that the \"Sex Offender\" email was to show me a list of sex offenders in our vicinity -- and not that my identity had been wrapped up in some devastating crimes as I'd feared.  My initial panic wasn't due to a guilty conscience.  [OVERSHARE ALERT...] When I got married at age 24, I was a virgin by choice, so...  No illicit encounters in my life.  Ever.  Thus, my panic on the way home from Costco was: \"How will I clear my name if it's really bad?  Hire an attorney?  How costly is that?\"    ALL OF THIS TO SAY:  IdentityForce is obviously a GREAT service -- especially now that I can savor the value of the emails that initially caused me concern.  BUT...maybe on the email banner it should say something like: \"SEX OFFENDERS IN YOUR AREA -- UPDATE\".  That communicates more clearly and mitigates the drama for new customers.And, to a lesser degree of urgency, maybe the other email banner could be something like: \"SMART SSN VERIFICATION UPDATE.\"    Because if you put the two existing banners together, it tends to present a scary snapshot.  Just thought I'd share with you my morning adrenaline."

I am in the Middle East and my internet is extremely slow, and she still waited for me to log in and verify that everything was in order. After that, she also stayed on the call to answer some general questions about Identity Force that I had.I can be an extremely stubborn person when it comes to a company's customer service. I will cut business with a stellar company if their customer service is terrible. If the other representatives are even half as courteous, knowledgeable, and helpful as Shekia, I will be sticking around Identity Force for a long time to come."

That,  Donna,  Senior Marketing Officer, would take the time out of her busy schedule to do this for one member, outstanding, that is the essence of \"great customer service\" also there was not a hint of an excuse, speaks volumes of a company culture that exists at Identity Force. I am reserving my final opinion on this trilogy of reviews. I was upset in the beginning of my experience with this company. Because of their actions and attention to details , I am giving them a chance to win me over for good. So stay tuned in for the last chapter, I am hoping for a positive outcome. Raymond Hirth"
