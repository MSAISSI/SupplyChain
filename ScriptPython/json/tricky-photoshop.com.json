In the end I paid for the photo to see it clearly and it looked very poor. I had to literally draw and circle what was wrong with the photo for the editor to see what was wrong, in the end they sent me back a photo that was almost comical as it looked that ridiculous. It was extremely poor and looked as if it was edited by someone using Microsoft paint. In the end i asked for a refund and they didn\u2019t give me one. I now longer nee the photo as I posted something else as It took 3 days for this entire conversation. There were breaks of hours between replies. An extremely poor service and not a \u201ctricky photoshop solution\u201d, as my request was not complicated. Extremely poor communication and would not recommend"

I only gave them a 2 because I\u2019m the beginning they were responsive but the longer this went on, a week now, that has gotten bad too. All I requested was a professional background, all 3 individuals to the photo and change a man\u2019s tux from white to black. First the background was nothing but a solid gray \ud83d\ude0f. The next image they sent just had 2 individuals added and the tux was still white. The next one I received was of 2 Indian people. The next one still only had 2 of the 3 added and now only the tux jacket is black, the paints are still white. I responded and told them I must be on Candid Camera. This has been a total fail. I won\u2019t use them again and a week later I still don\u2019t have what I asked for. Not sure how they can say \u201c24 hour turnaround \u201c."

The final outcome was good, but anyone working with them should factor that in beforehand. My initial instructions were perfectly clear and it was extremely frustrating to interact with them while I reiterated my ask.  Also, they have a very uncomfortable price scheme and will ask you \"how much are you willing to pay...?\" There should be some sort of settle price list in place."
