          "Contenu": "Unfortunately, my order of 7 photo albums was a total disaster! They arrived with horrible ink bleeds throughout all 7 albums. There was NO customer service, only a chat box that made me take and submit pictures. I was later contacted by email (Rachel Goodnight), who helped send a reorder. However, the SECOND reorder had problems with pages printed out of alignment. I contacted Rachel and she sent a THIRD order out which just arrived. That reorder was good... finally. I would say you need to find another printer contractor because the one you have is absolutely terrible. Although Rachel was helpful, this whole ordeal has been extremely distressful and frustrating as these albums are Christmas gifts and I spent MANY LONG HOURS creating the layout. Consequently and regrettably, I will NOT use this service again, NOR will I ever recommend anyone use it. It was just too horrible of an experience."

It cost so much and the quality does not measure to the price.  I paid 35 euros (thats with a 25% discount) so I would've paid a lot more for a very cheap product."

The look and layout options decreased in my opinion but I ordered because on the shelve they all had the same height and look. Now I ordered a book and received one from mimeo. The book cover is in bad condition (dirty and wrinkles). It is a Christmas present and honestly looks aweful compared to what the booked used to be. Also all the photo pages feel different in the hand, the colors don't shine as they used to and there is a strange dull pattern on every single page. You see it as soon as sun or light shines on it. I loved these photo books but am honestly shocked what they are now.The service (chat) is slow and the answers are translated because they kept asking for things I already mentioned and the grammar, as well as sayings (like you're welcome) were wrong. The prices (also for shipping increase) but the quality does not."

So I started from the beginning - this time same thing happened at page 116 (using the new 120 page format).  Sadly this was a gift for my husband in honor of our 30th wedding anniversary.  Now I have nothing to show for hours and hours of work.  I contacted support (was told they were for Mimeo) - they sent me an app to clean up the Motif app.  Quite frankly I am not tech savvy enough to use it (76 years old).  I literally sat in my chair and cried.  So frustrated.  What to do?  Will contact Apple to discuss the App cleaner but will more than likely look for a new company!  So disappointed and frustrated. Beware if you use the Motif program!!"

I know what I sent off because I double checked it several times to be sure I had everything laid out correctly, and used a hand-written check-list to be sure everything was included the way I intended. When I went to check with my Motif account to see if this was somehow my error, the project didn't even show up as ever having been completed, despite having actually received the book!  I reprinted everything as single photos and put them in a photo album myself.  Arrrrg. Won't use this product again!"

They give you a delivery date knowing they cannot meet that date. Best stick to a UK company. First order I gave them the benefit of the doubt but second order was just as bad."

A discount that would have been nice to offset the surprisingly steep shipping costs. The calendar itself is fine, it\u2019s of a decent quality and it looks nice, its just a shame the rest of the experience was so unpolished."

          "Contenu": "Making this book was laborious and time consuming. - For starters, there's no high image per page template available. So we couldn't just click and fill and be done with it, instead we had to edit each page (100 pages!!)- Reflowing the images feature can easily destroy your whole book, and there's no version revert functionality. So if you mess up, you have to start again. Made the experience anxiety producing. - We made the mistake of removing duplicate images from our Apple photo library only to find that half the images must have been in the book. They simply disappeared leaving a blank space and no clue as to which images they were. - can't reorder the photos by created date. 99% of books we make are chronological!- Glitchy checkout! It kept failing to create the book, or got stuck in a checkout step.Promo codes: there's a promo code on Motif's Instagram with no expiry date, but doesn't work because? (sure it's for Valentines day, but take it down!). Motif also doesn't reply to questions on Insta.Promo codes also have to be entered with no character spaces before or after them. How hard would that be for a developer to code out? Not the experience Motif strives for I'm sure. Plus side was, a few incremental stability improvements and customer support was quick.P.S. Responding to Motif's reply: - As mentioned, the templates available weren't suitably dense for our needs, we wanted one with 8-12 images per page default interspersed with feature images. We wish there were more diverse design templates. - We did start duplicating the project AFTER we lost one book. Didn't see mention in onboarding that you should duplicate your project to protect your progress. I'm surprised Motif hasn't developed  functionality to revert to previous versions. Really framed the experience for us. - we write a review and then we have to go to another site and input feature requests. Not very customer centric."

But when I checked out the discount was not applied automatically and if there was a place to insert the code (Sum40 I think) it was not apparent. When I called the Motif help line, which was clearly a call center, they only told me I could cancel the order and repeat the order. I asked for a supervisor but was not granted this request. The book looks nice but service is poor and I should have been granted this request. I spent over $115 but should have been 40% less, and it should have been easy to refund that to my card. Other photo sites are in existence so Motif needs to improve."

The cards came but they weren't my cards, they were another family's cards (which I still have). I asked to have mine reprinted and overnighted at your expense which, thankfully, you did. But no one on your customer service side responded on how to return the wrong cards even though I asked twice. Not a great experience."

If I am giving a calendar as a gift I have to be sure I leave enough time for it to be reprinted in case one photo throws the exposure of the entire page. Something in the app to show how it sees the page exposure would be helpful. Otherwise I would need  the ability to create the composite outside of Motif and import it, but for that I need the exact aspect and dimensions the app will use."

Looking through the Mimeophotos.com web site there was no where on the site (even on the \u201csupport\u201d pages) to raise order issues or even contact a Mimeo representative in any way. Using an email link I had recorded from previous books for Motif I was able to contact a Mimeo rep, but if you don\u2019t have that old email address good luck getting any help from these guys."

The 13\"x10 1/2\" dimensions of the calendar will force any photograph to be cropped to fit. For those to whom cropping is not a problem, this will not be an issue.  For  serious photographers who would like to display their images as they framed them, it would be greatly appreciated if Motif Photos would build into their software the ability to accomodate photos as they were taken.

Also, Motif needs to have more themes from which to choose.  Also, customer service needs improvement.  It took several emails and several days for me to get answers to questions when I was trying to learn how to use Motif.  Also, you need to have a customer service phone number listed in the \"Contact Motif\" on the website.  Turns out you actually do have a customer service phone number that has real people to talk to, but it took several emails to get you to give it to me.  A chat service would also be nice.Despite the bumps in getting to know how to use Motif, I will definitely use it again."

They had no clue.  So the ability to customize photos and text needs work as does their support.  On the bright side, the printed book was of high quality and it arrived on time.  So Motif delivers a good product if you can figure out the software yourself."

Maybe that was true but then in this last batch one of the prints was so bad due to the fact that the color was so distorted as to make the photo ugly and this time it had nothing to do with how light or dark it was. To be fair, they do get it right most of the time but their prints are all computer generated. There is no oversight. I at least look at my photos before I send them. I am looking for another company to do my prints. I\u2019ve never had problems like this before"

I do have a wish list for suggested changes:  In addition to the color wheel, I wish there were a color chart option with multiple fixed colors, similar in size to e-card softwares. Choosing a custom color is tedious. I do appreciate that once chosen, they are saved.   I wish font could be personally chosen  and fixed ahead of the project.   I wish that text boxes could be placed after page is set up without changing the picture placement   I wish the thumbnail pix being used, shown under the book were bigger, could remain arranged in order of  my placement, and \u2018used\u2019 could be collected in another, separate file- not just checked  and in \u2018all photos\u2019.

It's unfortunate that you got rid of the 8.5 x 11\" book as my art fit better in that format. The 8 x 8\" was more difficult to format. That said, the books look good, the paper is nice."

She proved to be outstanding; every response was immediate and helpful and she didn't give up until, after several days and many emails and interventions by her, I received five copies of the album. Each is now well printed and very faithfully reproduced. Entirely thanks to Michele I will use Motif again and my only advice, if you do have a genuine issue, is - Be patient , there is a real support team there and they will sort you out!"

It has taken many hours of tedious work to type in the recipes, stories, and cut lines.  The table of contents with all the spacing was a real bear!!  At times the times the text software was on its knees, so slow it would take forever to type in one word.  I re-booted my computer many times to get through the text box. I might add that my Mac Pro is very powerful and runs the latest operating software.It is great for picture books but can hardly handle large volumes of text. The book turned out great--lots of work!!"

Mainly with trying to change the parameters of an image within a box. The yellow handles are so frustrating to work with.Another photo program I use is much more user friendly. I will use motif again because of delivery speed but I will use the rival program for its ease of use. My wish would be a program that is as easy to use as powerpoint is.Customer service was fantastic. It was a quick response and very helpful.Note: I did two orders: Oct 30/22 and Nov 7/22."

My only critique is that I wish I had a few more design controls in creating the book (such as putting strokes/frames around images, overlapping images and adjusting the picture and type page insets), but am still giving 5 stars, understanding that some of these omissions is to make the books as foolproof as possible to create for people without print design experience. Hopefully they can continue to add new features as the program evolves. There were a few odd things, but I soon found workarounds for them (example: style a sample text box and then copy and paste that text into other text boxes you create. Saves a lot of time styling. Being able to just copy and paste the entire text box would be better still)."

When the albums arrived I was blown away by the professional look, feel and weight of it. Even the gold colour looks gold, which doesn't happen very often. They arrived very well packaged too and each album has a protective sleeve. Would highly recommend using Motif and I look forward to creating another project this way."
