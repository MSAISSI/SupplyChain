I told them this is how I support myself and my handicapped child do you have monetization from day one? I was told absolutely and the advertising says the same thing regardless of audience size. I signed up and was told your audience isnt big enough we will put you on a waiting list LOL. I showed them the advertising where it said it didnt matter AND screenshots of my other Podcast hosted elsewhere with 700k downloads a month. Still NOPE, I dont want all my eggs in one basket. I told them how important it was due to being handicapped and crickets no one seems to care. You already paid. I also asked how to lower the tier since I already have four episodes out and was going to possibly wait to see what happens. Never got an answer after asking 3 times. Look Libsyn does not offer anything better then any other hosting and some offer monetization from day one. Seeing the dollars add up is really motivating especially when your kid requires food. More honest companies as well and who dont take advantage of the handicapped. Heartbreaking."

          "Contenu": "I'm a rookie, amateur podcaster. I went with Libsyn as a hosting platform by recommendation from another small-op podcast. I've been with Libsyn a little less than a year but longer than a human fetus gestation. My experience has been lukewarm and really plummeting in the last month. For background I work fulltime in healthcare and so does my co-host. It's just us two and he's a Boomer so I take care of all the producing and tech-related aspects of the podcast. Getting the 'Destinations' setup took a little of forum perusing - it's a bit more of a multi-step process for bigger podcast platforms like 'Apple Podcast' and 'Spotify'. Small hiccup.My ONE decent Pro is the remote recording feature that is relatively new. I like that it gives you separate tracks for speakers and a 'master' track option. The major con is similar to Skype/Google Meet in that the audio competes and cuts out if people are talking over each other. Makes for a nightmare in post-production when I have to use AI to regenerate pieces of audio. The biggest headache and absolute TRAINWRECK is the website and interfacing a podcast feed with Libsyn. For context I was hoping to create a 'blog' style feed that I could add transcripts and resources to. There is the option to embed a player but that option is essentially just a media player. The other option is to use an RSS feed to embed the episodes on a website and that's fine if all you want is the show notes in tiny, plain, black text with ZERO formatting (good luck with brand consistency). Libsyn is retiring their 'Legacy' website, which is pretty rudimentary at best. Very bare bones, but honestly I could've worked with it and truthfully I have no idea when it is officially going to be 'retired'. That being said, Libsyn is hardcore promoting its sister company 'Pair Networks' or 'Pair Domains' where you can buy a domain and create a website. A podcast website. Sounds great? It's not. It's the worst experience ever. Apparently the podcast website is supposed to be WordPress based, but when you create a website through Pair Networks it defaulted to a Weebly-based. Still never figured out how to move it from Weebly servers to Wordpress services through Pair. There is absolutely ZERO interfacing between Pair Networks and Libsyn. And there's no way to fix it either. The Libsyn forums on linking podcast episodes to an external website are outdated and there's nothing for guidance on how to do so with the 'sister' companies nonexistent interfacing. Well I built a Weebly website and when I had to update the expiring card information Pair Networks deleted the entire site I built. I've contact support at both Libsyn and Pair and usually get a generic, bot response and promptly receive notification my 'ticket' is closed/marked as resolved even though it's definitely not. This whole process has been so frustrating therefore I'm moving our entire podcast to Buzzsprout. If you're fine with bare bones you can probably crutch your way through the Libsyn platform as a beginner but if you want any semblance of interfacing with a podcast website I absolutely CANNOT recommend Libsyn."

          "Contenu": "Some of the worse customer experience I've ever had. Went with Libsyn after reading a handful of reviews. I chose it because of the relatively easy \"plug & play\" model it project to be. After setting up the free website that comes with using Libsyn I purchased a special domain website name through Libsyn suggest company (which they also own) called Pair Domains. Since purchasing specific domain name I've yet to be able to get the Libsyn host to point to domain name (a feature that was crucial to whatever hosting service I was going to use). After looking through site FAQ to attempt to troubleshoot myself, all I found was an outdated article from nearly 4 years go when the features looked completely different and the suggestions in the article are not even ones that you can institute as the backend of Libsyn doesn't now include most of the buttons or menus the article points you to. Thus, I sent a ticket asking how to do this. After 4 emails later the support person claimed he'd \"solved\" my issue but never actually did anything or gave me the info I needed. Simply told me the issue was on the \"Pair\" side of the equation. I called Pair support and they stated it was all on the Libsyn side. No phone number for Libsyn support. So good luck there. A task that should have taken 5 min has stretch into 2 weeks and I've essentially spent hours of my time & money trying to get this to work. I've yet to launch a single episode but already heavily regret going with this \"service\" that feel like much more of a scam."

          "Contenu": "I started my podcast in 2017 and Libsyn was my feed.  In all these years, things ran so smoothly I had no reason to contact Customer Support.  Due to a change in my team that uploads my shows, I have needed to contact support.I have been online since the mid 90s and have seen a lot come and go.  This level of support that Libsyn offers is like gold to have as a resource.  I am thankful for my decision years ago to host my podcast on Libsyn. I never needed to contact them before and now that I have, they are the best and some of the nicest and smartest people you will find in the podcast world.In case you haven't noticed, now everyone and their dog is coming up with a podcast.  And every company in the world also wants in on podcasting.Libsyn will give you the support you will need, I contacted them because I was in a jam with a staff change and they had my back 100%.The internet is full of companies that get into a hot market to only later crash and burn.  I worked in Silicon Valley, that is how it works, when the people offering the \"free\" stuff, crash and burn, so does all of your work with them.  I am glad I found LIbsyn because when I needed them recently, they were there with the correct answers, not just any answer;)"
