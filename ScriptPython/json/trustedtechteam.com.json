I was sent to TTT via a trusted friend and decided to ask for help and feedback from the chat support about what I needed and should do. I was paired with Kristin who not only answered my questions, but provided me with valuable feedback and support. She was very kind and professional and made my experience very personalized and very pleasant. I bought a digital Windows 10 code from the site and received it very promptly, with succinct installation instructions. As it turns out, as I was going to activate the product, my Microsoft account already had a digital Windows 10 attached to it from when I upgraded from 7 some odd year or so ago. With a laugh and some chagrin, I return to my still-open chat tab with Kristin, and inform her of my situation. Thankfully TTT has a wonderful guarantee on software purchases, and I was able to request a refund of my as of yet unused key. She was able to process that swiftly and with shared amusement at my predicament.Ramble aside, fantastic customer service, and a great source for software."

I called TTT, there was almost no wait time before a Tech Team member talked to me and answered my questions and told me what I needed to do to fix my problem. As I stated above, once I get the \"Bugs\" fixed with my PC I'll update  my review. Thank You TTT, I was at a lost as to what to do next. I was offered a refund but since I have 30 days to fix my PC issues and I'm confident that I know what the problem is, and what needs to be done to fix said problem. So, i'll take the PC to the shop on the 9th of July and in a few days, I'll have a fully working computer to play with. I say again: Thanks so very much for your support and I highly recommend TTT to everyone."
