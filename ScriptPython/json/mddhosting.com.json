Every question or need that I've had has been taken care of quickly. Ticket response time has always been under 5 minutes.The value of MDD Hosting is far better than WP Engine, so if you're considering one of the bigger providers, I encourage you to check out MDD Hosting.

I never thought I would like a hosting provider without phone support, but their support is 100x better than Go Daddy's ever was, and they always respond almost immediately! They are truly the best, and I don't intend to ever take my business elsewhere. They are patient (especially with people like me who aren't super technical and feel a bit stressed when things seem to go awry (often my own user error)), and they are always professional, dependable, and go the extra mile to make sure their customers are really taken care of. I couldn't give a company or team my higher recommendation. Super grateful for them all of these years."

          "Contenu": "MDDHosting has been my web host for over ten years. I'm a website designer, and most of my clients have taken my advice and opted for MDD as well. I get no kickbacks for the recommendations. I just want my clients to have the same excellent experience I've had.Recently I had a problem installing some credit-card processing software. I'm good at following instructions, but something wasn't working. I had help from a tech at the software company, and we worked on it for most of a week. Finally the tech mentioned in passing that it could be a server problem. So I opened a ticket with MDD and asked them if the server might be blocking the processing. No, the problem turned out to be that I had missed something in the original software installation. The tech guy didn't find it, but somehow Michael, the main guy at MDD, was able to trace that error and FIX IT! Took him about 10 minutes.As usual, the response to the initial ticket came in under a minute. (By the way, you can often get instant help with chat, but this case was complicated enough that I wanted to present full details.)I've had nothing but excellent service for my entire time with MDD. In my business I hear many scare stories about hosts. I can only be thankful I found MDD when I did."
