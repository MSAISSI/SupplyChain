Service & functionality good.We moved to a VOIP system that included texting and AI and tracking of all communication for a customer.The process to \"port out\" has changed my referral of people that would have needed your service un-fortunately.  When I had to threaten FCC guidelines to obtain the proper porting info, that leaves a bad taste."

She even called in to my business number, if that isn't verification enough I don't know what else is. She was extremely rude during the process, her name is Kami Rowe I believe, she wouldn't let me ask any questions, she left me on the call. I was really embarrassed. If this is how you treat people I can't imagine how you treat your workers or customers."

I've done some comparative estimates with other companies and Text Request is so significantly higher. The reason I haven't switched? I simply haven't figured out which direction I want to go in. With a heavy heart I say there is no other option for me in the near future, not with the pricing of the other systems out there. I will eventually be moving on from Text Request simply because of the pricing. But again the product itself is stellar."
