There isnt a mention of you being our answering service so our Customer thinks they are speaking with us. These issues are not occurring back to back but often enough to mention for quality assurance. If specific examples are needed, they can be found in our history. I will mention that when i have the time to report a specific example, I receive a response pretty quickly. The problem is I dont have the time to report each one."
