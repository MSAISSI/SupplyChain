I'm really happy to report a significant improvement in my energy levels after just 2-3 days of using this! It also helps to adhere to a set schedule (bedtime/waking) to achieve a more balanced circadian rhythm. The glasses are lightweight, well-built, and shut off automatically. The light is bright but not unbearably so, as I've read some other similar devices are. The app is helpful but I don't think it's a necessity."

It's great to see a product that actually delivers on its promises.For me I am especially excited about the Circadian Rhythm features, which are crucial for good sleep and health. It is refreshing to see a product taking a unique approach to this aspect of health. Very glad to note the scientific backing and collaborations, that make the whole experience feel more satisfying and secure.While AYO Circadian Health App is still in early access and has room for improvement(I want to see more options for customization of goals, notifications, etc.), the potential is undeniable!I can't wait to see how this product evolves. Highly recommended! \ud83d\udc4d"

After my contact with goayocom, I was sent the newest version of the glasses immediately and they kept in touch with me till the glasses were delivered at my address. The service is splendid and friendly. The glasses are very helpful indeed. I am very glad I am able to use them again. 15-4-2023De Ayo lite was binnen 5 maanden gebroken. Hierdoor kon hij niet meer aan en uit gezet worden. Tot nu toe wil de verkoper (titan-commerce.com, mindtecstore.com, ipnetshop.de) niet helpen met reparatie.Now in contact with Ayo support international.

          "Contenu": "AYO wearable bright light therapy glasses are the best! I notice the benefits of bright light therapy within 1 day of beginning use. I fall asleep easier, sleep more soundly, wake up easier, and have more energy during the day. It also seems to make my mood more resilient. Bright light therapy has always been challenging for me to implement in my daily routine because I don\u2019t spend time sitting in one place. By making a wearable, AYO has made it simple and easy for me to do. And the positioning of the light just above my eyes seems like it\u2019s more efficient and consistent than just sitting near a light. Plus it doesn\u2019t feel too bright and make my eyes feel overstimulated. This is my second AYO wearable. The new model has a few updates that make it even better than the first! Starting a session is as simple as opening the glasses and wearing them for 20 minutes. That simplicity has made it even easier for me to get into a routine of doing the therapy every morning and any other time I could use a boost. Well done, AYO!"

I do like wearing them in the morning, while still getting ready for work and have some downtime for myself. They seem to help me get in optimal mood and state before my busy schedule for the day starts. The glasses stay and feel comfortable when wearing them (you can easily adjust the nose piece), something that was particular important for me when choosing what product to buy.The app is nicely done and I like that I am able to choose specific routines to follow, as well as have reminders for light exposure (something I did not get enough of previously while being in the office).Also, had to reach out to their customer support about some questions around the app. They were very responsive and were immediately able to help out."

          "Contenu": "I\u2019ve had my Ayo wearable for several months now and that\u2019s been the winter I have felt at my best best, both mentally, and physically. I dread winters due to the short days and lack of sunlight and, therefore, I tend to feel low on energy and mood. After listening to many of Andrew Huberman\u2019s episodes, I became so fascinated with health optimization. I learned that light, alongside sleep, nutrition and exercise, is fundamental to overall health and performance. Since then, I have been very conscious and experimenting with all kinds of products. I am using different trackers (e.g. Oura) and have seen the positive impact Ayo has had on my sleep and performance during the past months. I am also enjoying the app, which is beautiful although a bit limited at the moment. The team assured me that new features are coming soon, Apple Health integration is the one I am particularly interested in. Subjectively, I am also feeling much sharper, more alert and in better mood than previous winters. I have recommended this device to all of my health-conscious friends already and look forward to utilizing it more in the months to come."

My sleep quality and energy levels are on a whole new level, and not sure how to fully describe this but I feel healthier. I\u2019ve been an night owl my whole life and waking up early in the morning was a major pain, especially during the winter time. Moreover, as I am working from home, I could not get myself to follow a good morning routine (\u2026snoozing the Alarm clock 3-4 times was normal for me) Since COVID-19 hit I have tried to work more on my health and sleep, especially reading up on best practices and trying them out. Eventually i stumbled up on Huberman (HubermanLab podcast) and realized how important it is to get 20-30 minutes of morning sunshine into your eyes within 1-1.5 hours after waking up to maintain a healthy circadian rhythm. I try to get as much sunlight every morning but during the winter this is almost impossible, so thats when these glasses came to my rescue. I use AYO whenever I am unable to get the much-needed circadian light from the sun in the morning, which is most days in winter. For me, these glasses are life changing, as I am finally able to maintain a correct circadian rhythm, good quality sleep and high energy during winter days. Thanks to AYO I believe this winter will be the first one in many in which I won\u2019t experience SAD and winter blues. Could not recommend them more!!!"

Spoiler: it was the best experience I ever had, with any customer service.I wrote them a message some weeks ago, that time in desperate need for help. A few days earlier, I tried on the AYO glasses from a friend. At that time there were also other friends around and after wearing them for a while, I casually put them back on the table.The next day, though, the friend came to me, telling me, that she had found her glasses broken the other day. I was shocked. I was sure, that I did nor break them, while wearing and also not while putting them back on the table. But unfortunately, it was undeniable, that her glasses were broken. As I was the last one, who had used them, I had to take the responsibility. And so I tried to fix them. But no phone repair store, nor any optician could/wanted to help me.So I reached out to the AYO service. I explained them my situation and asked them for help. And long story short, after showing them a proof of purchase, they told me that they will send my friend a new (even updated) pair, for free!! Even though the glasses were out of warranty.I'm truly amazed and very grateful for AYO's generosity.As I wrote in the beginning, this was the best experience that I ever had, with a customer service. Thank you again AYO Team!"
