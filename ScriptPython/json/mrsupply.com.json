          "Contenu": "I ordered two small light switches that were missing from our apartment's bathroom. We had a holiday party with 100 guests scheduled, and we turned to MrSupply to provide the parts. We paid an additional fee, which was ten times the price of the parts themselves, to ensure they would arrive at our home before 10:30 AM on the day of the party. Unfortunately, the parts did not arrive until after 10 PM, long after the party had ended. I am hopeful that the company will uphold their commitment and refund the extra charges for expedited delivery, as they did not meet their promised timeline. Stay tuned for more updates."

They told me that they had received all my messages (but never bothered to reply???) and that they were sending out a replacement right away. They never sent a replacement. I do not recommend purchasing anything from this company.

I called them and they said there's no other way to process the purchase. The representative asked me the order number, which I provided. He then said \"your order is canceled\" and hung up on me. If this isn't a complete fraud of a company trying to steal my information, then it is extremely poorly run."

When the floor sink arrived, there was no grate with it and when I called today they were not aware of it. They just canceled the half grate from the original order and never added the new grate to the order. As a result I have an unhappy customer and had to pay a second shipping charge for the new grate I ordered today. I paid for expedited shipping on the first order as I needed the floor sink ASAP. Now after paying the expedited shipping I have to pay for shipping charges again for a product that I can't install until the order is completed."

I called them and confirmed the pricing.  was on the line with them for 12 minutes so they could verify the pricing.  then call them and I get told people make mistakes.  Not in this situation.  I called you to verify the price, told you I needed them by Tuesday and you cancel the order without even letting me know.  they say they sent me an email but I'm sure it went to junk and why would I be looking for an email by them.

After 4 days went by with no updates I called mr supply and they said that these products were back ordered, and they did not know why they would have told me. They're expectation was that they do not need to communicate the availability or accurate timelines to they're patrons. Make sure you expect everything to come in a month even when you pay for over night. I would not recommend using this company, I will be sourcing from other places in the future."

All items were received in excellent condition, and new, yet one item was wrong. The Leviton blank Keystone plug that I ordered was black like the rest of my Leviton items, what they shipped, loosely as in not in a package was a brown one. It wasn't worth my time to contact them and again either wait or argue with them so I just let it go. Bought it somewhere else at a higher price.

This was for the older pre-\"series A\" load enters.The product delivered was a series A load center. Apparently the older panels are no longer available after Siemens acquired Murray.The series A load center is not up gradable to main breaker . I require a main breaker to have a means of disconnect in a separate building.The Murray product listing on the site still needs updating, and the pictures of the products still apparently need updating.Mr supply support went out of their way to send me info on an alternate product that turned out to also not be up gradable. For this I thank them, and it shoes their good customer support.If the product had been what was described on the Website, I would have given a Five star review.I would order for Mr Supply again, after verifying the the product shown is current.The big issue here is that Siemens did not clearly show/document the change.It is not clear from the Siemens site when the change occurred or that purchasers should very product versions and functionality. Multiple other suppliers are also affected by this change in product style By Murray /Siemens."

Which as stated above is 2 left sided duplex (plug in's) and 1 right side decora (light switch). I only needed (1) but ordered (2) of them because the shipping was more than the item bought. I figured if the one I installed broke I at least have a replacement for about $1.00 difference in shipping cost of ordering 1. Shipping was way too much I could ship this item for under $3 and was charged $13.96. Guess they had me over a barrel as I could not find one anywhere else."

It is a lighter color than the others, which are Almond, and were installed in 1999. Maybe it's just the time difference. I don't know.My wife is willing to accept the color difference, so we are not looking for any action on your part - just wanted you to know that this difference was a surprise to us."
