          "Contenu": "Have been streaming for years using restream, for the first time they have added a pumpkin icon where our assets are - preloaded videos and images are, now I guessed where it was, but for those on the team who may not be able to discern it clearly - this was a problem, the platform had especial glitches today, freezing when the livestream was inadvertently ended and not reverting to the Orange/Red 'Go Live now', so we would know it had stopped streaming. Please keep the platform professional with consistent icons, it is not necessary to make the functional icons seasonal. We have seen the Christmas overlays last year, thank you. However some users like ourselves are using restream for corporate purposes in a team setting."

Finally after 4 months I requested for a prorated refund which they denied. I will advise users not to go with Restream or atleast be on their monthly plan and not go for annual plan."

It seems they have much traffic from the UK that it take for ever to let you sign in to the service. We stream from different countries including in europe and I noticed the login issue only from inside the UK. Platform always miss things up, Chat integration will not work. video will not start, user syncing issues. Logo appears to you but not in youtube and loads of other problems. Their customer service are quite fast and nice unless it's a core problem then that act like novice and do time wasting tactics so you'll give up before they admit the problem. They'll ask for endless number of reports and snaps just so tire you because they know about the issue and have no way to resolve it.In general they are good but very unstable.and for the PR who will reposnd to this asking me to speak to them for solutions, I already did and willing to have a chat to demostrate all issues I suffer from. Please don't respond with the same template. find my phone number from your platform and give me a ring."

I have been charged today with the last money that I have and they do not want to refund it because I forgot to cancel the subscription. They should have at least have a 3 days refund policy when it comes to automatic charges like this because there are people who really need their money and there are times that people forget what subscriptions they have on other websites. Their Customer Services turnaround time regarding escalations is pretty poor. 1-2 days? really? You have a live chat available 24/7 and there's no one to supervise regarding escalation? I have a chat active with the agent named \"Cray\" and it looks like he's ignoring my messages. I know how the Crisp live chat works and I know Multiple agents can see my chat and no one is responding. Is that how you treat your customers?I do not recommend this company to anyone who likes to go live on multiple platforms."

I pay 40 USD per month to have something that doesn't work, that is 480 USD for a service for which the tech guy is on vacation... not cool. I'm tired, I am a creative, I use restream to restream my content and I pay for it to work. I don't have time to try to figure out what are the issues between the tech guy on vacation and the customer support who keeps asking me same questions without fixing the issue. If you advertise a service that is supposed to broadcast everywhere, you need to be a little more clear about what you offer an make it work. You may want to warn the clients that the client will often have a lot of trouble to make it work : not because the client is stupid but simply because the service was not designed properly. If the tech guy is on vacation, then you need a replacement, I work 365 days a year and I don't have time for vacation. My business is everything and all these tech people who are not able to make things work are really really annoying me. If I provided that kind of quality of service to my clients, I would have a horrible reputation. Make it work or don't advertise something that does not work. Thanks"

The background feature doesn't work with phones and tablets. Periodically, setting up an external mic for live streams through Safari on iPad can get glitchy and people cannot hear you. I've had to simply disconnect the mic.Many of the channels on which you can multistream are platforms most people do not use, so it's overkill for the price.  You can't stream to IG,certain LinkedIn free accounts, or Tictoc (obviously). You don't need an app for Restream and it runs directly from a website.  This is a great plus for several reasons.  The learning curve is short and and the ease of use great. I an pleased with Restream but wish they would add more backgrounds, overlays,  and graphics to give us  more professional looks and greater variety.  Of note, if you're techno savvy, you may download your own."

It\u2019s designed for out of the box use and it\u2019s almost that. I ran into a couple of issues: 1. Video output bitrate being was too high for Twitch which made me appear offline; 2. Chat inputs from Twitch and YouTube would not display on Restream chat when I tested them using different profiles. Oddly enough a spam chat items got through via YouTube which I\u2019ve never gotten until I started on Restream (not sure if that\u2019s a customer data vulnerability). Great feature though to be able to block/interact directly (on behalf of your YouTube account) within Restream chat. In both instances, I had to search for solutions which I found outside of Restream. I also don\u2019t know how to get to the chat from home, so I have to Google to get to its landing page and then select browser chat window over desktop app (on my phone which is my second screen). It\u2019s also hard to get to the broadcast page."

I used their free plan for most of that time & finally upgraded to a basic plan this year.In all that time, Restream has worked flawlessly. I can honestly say I've never had issues with streaming, bandwidth,  quality, or any other aspect of the service. There have been times when I suspected Restream might be the source of some issue, but in every case it's proven to be a problem elsewhere (local settings, problems with Twitch or YouTube, etc.).Is it perfect? No, of course not. Along the way there have been minor issues with the web UI (which they've fixed). I feel like there's room for improvement in configuring sources (I have to go tweak settings right before every stream--it's a minor issue, but it could be better). But overall? Their free plan is really generous (even after limiting it to two target platforms) and their paid plans are a good deal for the price.Looking forward to using their platform for a long time to come. :)(Oh, and for folks saying they wish they could change how the chat looks, you can! You need to know CSS to do it, but it's possible.)"

We ran into technical glitches and it was just not user-friendly. I was not really excited about switching over to Restream because I was already exhausted by the countless hours of footage compromised and non-editable. I just thought it might be a video software tool thing in today's modernized age. However, once finding Restream everything changed! It is absolutely amazing how advanced and seamless using their software is. Our footage comes out without any GLITCHES or problems! Such a BEAUTIFUL back-end too! We have a team network of 400+ students and all of them LOVE and CHOOSE Restream for our Public Speaking needs at our student mission Assuaged.com. There are such useful tools and abilities to make your show look lively and AMAZING. The pre-recording feature and ability to stream to MULTIPLE platforms at a reasonable cost are among the best and most exclusive features. This company is ethical and supports various charitable causes. They especially support organizations that represent minorities such as the military and people with disabilities. We love you Restream family!"
