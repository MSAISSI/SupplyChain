          "Contenu": "Deceptive and sneaky business practices. In August 2022 I tried a trial for $45, and decided within 24 hours that this was not suitable for my business. They forced me to pay the entire monthly payment and refunded $7.00, along with canceling my account. Now - in NOVEMBER 2023 - they have charged me $300 and claim I didn't cancel the account. No notifications at all - just charged my credit card.  ARE YOU KIDDING?? I have disputed this with the credit card provider after their customer service refused to help.UPDATE - they still refuse to correct their bogus system that did not properly cancel a subscription that I certainly canceled in August of 2022. The next step is to notify the BBB, and file theft/fraud charges. Nobody should have money stolen from them like Circleboom did to me.They continue to be appalling. If you charge a Non User 1.5 YEARS after cancellation, they should be ashamed and just issue the refund. Is business really that bad that they have to steal? Beware of this \"company\"."

          "Contenu": "My experience with this service was profoundly disappointing, bordering on deceptive. The company's blog misleadingly suggests that users have the capability to automatically remove fake followers. However, upon subscription, it becomes evident that this feature is non-existent. The only available option is to blacklist these followers, a far cry from the promised functionality.Furthermore, the user interface is exceptionally cumbersome and unintuitive, arguably one of the worst I have encountered. This frustration is compounded by a malfunctioning system. For instance, while the service allows you to utilize 'credits' to generate a CSV file, it fails utterly at providing a means to access this file. No download option is available, nor is any email link sent to retrieve it.To add to these shortcomings, the customer support is noticeably deficient. Despite reading customer emails, there is a conspicuous lack of response or assistance, leading to a feeling of being ignored and undervalued.In summary, the service not only fails to deliver on its promises but also provides a user experience that is deeply unsatisfactory, to the extent that it feels misleading and untrustworthy."

And also the pricing of Circleboom is a bit higher for me compared to other similar software I have used in the past. But they have few features that other don't have and I love it."

          "Contenu": "Circleboom is great for companies, streamers, influencers, and content creaters because of its easy to use interface and effectiveness on social media managing. I use both Twitter Management and Publish Tool. Twitter tool make it easier to have an insight about my followers and I can also search according to interests and hashtags. Tweet delete is the one I use most. There are tons of useful features and analytics to grow my social media. The only bad thing is its old interface but they will probably change it soon.On the other hand, Circleboom Publish is amazing since it gives me all the place to organize all of my social media. I can schedule my future posts and even connect rss feeds. I can share to multiple accounts with just one click. There are almost limitless options for posting.The last extension with the chat GPT ai post creator improved it to anotler level. It is a real time saver and totally entertaining to manage my social media accounts."

I contacted support and they first said that they were unable to refund me and that they would keep the 215.88 dollars for a one year subscription that I had not used and will not use. I managed to persuade the support eventually to give me back 180.89 dollars because they were able to change my subscription from a one year to a monthly subscription and were successfully able to refund me for the remaining 11 months that had not started. I am thankful for this compromise because I needed the money."
