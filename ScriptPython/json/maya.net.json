Although the customer service helped to delete my account, refund my payments, they still continuously attempt to charge my bank account monthly. Quite honestly, it feels like harassment. I have to constantly have my account frozen to avoid Maya Mobile from removing money again and again. So I guess the customer service is poor if they havent resolved this for me since September 2023.Complain Requests: 87032, 96744, 106455 (for every month after I no longer have maya mobile or requested these harassment attempts to remove funds from my account  stops) First request was when they managed to have funds removed from my bank account because i did not manually froze the card then"

I have been unable to get a eSim from them and 2 days later I have cancelled my order and selected a different carrier. A carrier I'm using to write this review from Peru. When I asked Maya why they still hadn't provided an eSim and when I could expect one they simple stated\"Thank you for contacting us. I am happy to help.  We are currently awaiting a restock of the eSIM you ordered. The order will be provisioned automatically when the eSIMs are available. In the meantime, I will be consulting our internal team for an update on the same.  You will receive an email with the activation code and instructions as soon as the eSIM is ready. We appreciate your patience and we will have this ready for you as soon as possible.\"Which is of zero help and offers no timeline. Their order page for Peru STILL says you will get your eSim within 2 minutes. This is very deceptive and leaves travelers frustrated at a time we would rather be having fun that chatting with Customer Service who offered zero help at all."

By mistake, Maya charged me twice to the same Esim. It only took one Mail and they immediately solved the issue and I had my money refunded in two days time. My biggest issue however is the connection. Maybe it is because Israel does not have good coverage for maya Once a day, I am shortly without internet connection, very inconvenient, when eg one of the main uses is to get tickets for transport."

Because of this I had to go around and look for an open network that actually worked, something that took me quite some time. When I then tried to activate it, it didn\u2019t work. So I had to use my regular sim card the first day to send necessary messages and to research how to get around. After having access to a network again on the third day I managed to contact support. They sent me a new qr code which finally worked. Kind of inconvenient using a qr code as it wasn\u2019t possible to scan it on the screen, you need a second device to display the qr code, which again became a hassle as I didn\u2019t have another device to use. Anyways after everything was fixed i had spent a total of 150 euro on data on my regular sim card. This entire experience was very bad, I recommend everyone to just buy a physical sim card in the country you arrive in. Don\u2019t fall for the trap of thinking getting an e sim is easier, it really isn\u2019t"

          "Contenu": "I attempted to load the eSIM on my unlocked iPhone 13 Pro. Got a message that the SIM was not supported which prevented me from getting into Settings to rid myself of it. I was in setup purgatory. After hours on the phone with Apple and my carrier (including an hour in my carrier's store), no one could solve my problem and I now seem to have a $1200 paperweight. Maya's support was unable to do anything either. At least I got my $18 back so I didn't *pay* to ruin my phone. Good luck out there.EDIT: just to be clear, I'm not stuck on the settings screen, I'm stuck in the initial setup that adding the eSIM to my UNLOCKED phone (purchased full price directly from Apple that's been working great for a year and a half) initiated. I can't get to settings. I can restart \u2014 indeed, I can factory reset! \u2014 but it just takes me back to the \"Hello!\" screen and when I hit the activation phase, the SIM fails and my only options are to try again or go back (which means try again). Five senior Apple advisors so far have scratched their head at this. I'm not saying that Apple bears no responsibility here (pretty clearly if scanning a QR code from the settings can brick your phone, that's bad design), but Maya needs to advise users better about the risks of their product and perhaps how to look in advance for possible hold ups. Had I known that this was even a remote possibility, I'd probably not tried to save a few bucks on my trip and just used my carrier's international rates. Now I'm out the cost of a pricey smart phone."

Once you pay it\u2019s a gamble, if it doesn\u2019t work right then there\u2019s nobody to fix the issue. I would definitely not recommend this service.Edit: During the process of my complaints, the Maya team informed me they issued a new e-SIM as it was clear the issue was not fixable, but the e-SIM never arrived. Upon my inquiry as to why I have not received the new e-SIM, their response was that it looked like I had used the 3GB internet, so instead, they offered an extra 1GB on the same e-SIM. By the time this was done, my stay in Israel was almost over, and I had deleted the e-SIM, so it was useless for me. I never said I could not use the internet - I could use it, but I had to restart the e-SIM constantly for it to work, which was very inconvenient. If I did not use the phone, the internet simply stopped working so I could not really receive messenger texts, WhatsApp, and other communication while offline, so I had to restart the phone again to check if I had missed calls or messages on those apps. I stand by what I am saying and I have evidence of the correspondence, otherwise, if everything went fine I would not write this review."

Ok the last day, the sim stopped working again. I have been following up with customer care and there is absolutely no response. This day was very important and I had to arrange taxi etc. And also i land in Vietnam that day i badly wanted the internet connection. I must have sent at least 10 emails and absolutely no response.

The SIM installation process is pretty simple, but does require 2 devices as you need to scan a QR code on the device you want the SIM to work on.Was all set up before I took off for Bali so expected data to be available when I landed.Unfortunately, it took about 4 days and many messages back and forth to get the connection working. Eventually I was provided a new QR code and once this was installed the connection worked great.I had a second SIM for a trip to Kochi in India and this worked perfectly within the first hour of landing.Then on to Singapore and again have spent 5 days going from WiFi to WiFi and continuously requesting support from Maya mobile. This support has been very friendly and professional, however woefully inadequate.I eventually gave up in Singapore and switched to Airalo which worked immediately.So, all in all, a very mixed experience."

No border issues, easy eSIM activation process, searching for the best mobile net etc. So far so good. I also had first experience in Mexico with maya.net. After first problems, it worked quite good. The maya.net customer service is amazing.BUT!I moved on to Costa Rica and decided to switch from local country data plan to LatSIM data plan.I\u2018m currently using it for about 2 weeks and can say that the mobile net is pretty bad\u2026 I\u2018m always getting LIBERTY and it seems to be the worst. I met many people getting KOLBI or CLARO. They are very pleased with fast connection.I was traveling through San Jos\u00e9, Guapiles, Limon, Puerto Viejo\u2026 Many cities\u2026 And everywhere I\u2019m getting stuck, experiencing slow connection, not only in rural region, also in San Jos\u00e9\u2026That might be also the the reason why 70% of my 3GB data plan is gone. It takes a long time, and I\u2018m using only google maps sometimes and internet research. No videos, no videocalls, no ICloud synch. Just surfing.To be honest, the data plan is not the cheapest compared to the physical SIM cards, you can buy.But the fact that maya.net says, they choose the best mobile net, was the reason using this provider.Summary:- Excelent Customer Service.Fast and customer friendly.- inadequate mobile net supply.In the end, this is decisive for my review only rating 2 of 5 points.Too bad\u2026"

The problem was that - and I was aware of this - after 30gb of usage they reduce your data speed. This made surfing the web excruciatingly slow, and often had me wishing I had used another company. I knew about this an expected it to come, but it was a harsh reduction in speed. Another thing Maya did - which I was not aware of - was block certain applications on my phone after 30gb of usage. This was annoying. The reason I went with Maya was because of the option to use a hotspot, but I would not recommend them if you plan to use more than 30gb with the unlimited package."

No issues using the esim in Guatemala on iPhone 12. Unfortunately the esim on iPhone 13 did not work with iMessage or FaceTime. It initially did work for web browsing, then abruptly stopped working altogether. Maya mobile was not able to resolve the issue, but did refund. I don\u2019t think this is an issue with the esim or Maya Mobile necessarily. I think it\u2019s an Apple issue as other esim users have had similar experiences. Ended up purchasing a regular sim from a Tigo vendor in Antigua for less and it worked no issues. If you have an iPhone, it might work, or it might not. Maya will refund you if it doesn\u2019t work though, so it\u2019s worth a shot. If it works, it\u2019s easier than having to buy a sim and swap."

Can definitely recommend it for Turkey.In Uzbekistan on the other hand, I kept losing the connection and the internet was extremely slow, I would say around 90% of the time I was without connection. Support was'nt really helping, they just replied with standardized answers/tips you can also find in their FAQs. Buying a physical sim card is much cheaper and will provide you with faster and most importantly reliable internet connection. No recommendation for use in Uzbekistan!Update 08.10.2023: I received a refund from Maya for the Uzbekistan data package - added one star for their support!"

Maybe user-error, but if so I can't be the only one? -The data went conspicuously fast. I'm super careful about streaming, uploading photos, etc and it went much, much faster than predicted based on my typical usage. Maybe I was on weak internet and it pulled from data sometimes?

You get only data and no calls/SMS with a Maya eSIM but that was enough for pretty much everything as you can call people through Whats App. In the USA it was a good price in comparison to prepaid SIMs from local network providers like AT&T or T-Mobile (which would include calls&messages though). In Nicaragua it would have been cheaper to get a local SIM card. But the fact that you can buy, download the Maya eSIM and set up everything in 5 min while being in the airport wifi is a BIG comfort and advantage which is the reason I'm giving 5 stars. Plus, they are transparent and tell you right away that the service is NOT a subscription. No scam or hidden payments. Yey! Good job, Maya!"

Then they sent me all kinds of tricks to make it work and I used 3 hours trying to do it, unsuccessfully. They gave me a full refund, which was good, but I was left wondering if I had bought a new phone for nothing, if esim was more trouble than it's worth.So I set aside a day when I had plenty of time and bought a card from Maya, expecting the worst. It took about 5 or 10 minutes from payment to getting online, and I am one very happy customer."

Thinking it was a settings issues i accessed the sim manager to check, only to find my phone (Samsung S21) froze, several reboots later and the phone failed to respond to attempts to access sim manager. I left my phone whilst we left the airport to hunt down our transfer to the southern outskirts of Side / Manvagat. About 15mins into the journey i noticed my phone had gained a signal for the e-sim. After which I enjoyed the next 10 days  of network data. I've scored Maya 5* as it may have been my own impatience that caused the issue rather than the network as after I got connected I had no further issues. I even got a message when my data was 50% used which was handy too. Ordering and Setting up the initial esim was easy to do, with Maya offering the best value esim."
