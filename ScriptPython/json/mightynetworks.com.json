          "Titre": "Unfortunate Limitations",
          "Contenu": "I am disappointed with the limitations of Mighty Networks. 1. Firstly, they do not have an optimised high converting checkout process. If someone were to click to join my membership, they are taken through a process of creating an account with Mighty Networks first, taking the customer through many steps before they even pay. What they should be doing to increase conversions, is have the customer go straight to checkout, make the payment and then get redirected to create their account. I had quite a few customers who started the process and didnt finish, and therefore didnt join the membership. Very disappointed they dont even think about this, and so my conclusion was i would have to use my own checkout and use zapier to link the members and therefore have to manage everything manually, which there is a great limitation and not worth the monthly amount they charge.2. Their setup with Stripe is an accounting nightmare. When a new member subscription is created through Mighty Network, they setup the payments in Stripe, but what they fail to do is actually transmit the Product Name/Product Description to Stripe, so when it comes to me doing my accounts, i cannot easily distinguish or find in Stripe which of my transactions are coming from membership payments. It has created an accounting nightmare for me, where im in the process of trying to setup even more complex zaps so i can have these transactions recorded properly for my accounting. Such a simple requirement that Mighty Networks cannot even fulfill.3. Mighty Networks are a membership community. So what is common when it comes to memberships? CANCELLATIONS. However Mighty Networks have not even setup a proper Cancellation or Retention process. When my members cancel, i dont even know WHY. They do not even get the opportunity to write their reason for cancellation. They just cancel and thats it, thats the end of the road. How can this feature not be included? Im running my membership platform blind if i dont know why people are cancelling. Im thinking these people seriously lack common sense. For this reason i dont think the monthly cost of Mighty Networks is worth it, because at this rate i have to setup everything manually outside of Mighty Networks, from an optimised well converting checkout, to having a properly described transactions in stripe and to setting up my own cancellation process. NOT GOOD."

Unfortunately, I missed the renewal date and was charged again.I contacted them to ask for a refund as I did not intend to use the service nor had I used the service all the previous year. Cx reply was simply that they wouldn't offer a refund.Instead of offering an alternative or somewhat of a reasonable customer facing solution, they just flatly refused. I feel this is operating in bad faith and with priority over retaining fees from members who they know will not use their services."

That is the last straw for me.  Their move to Spaces has cost me over $10,000 of time as it accounts for many hours of work and effort.  The new changes are entirely useless.  The remaining content is disorganized and the images that we paid staff to add to the content have been removed in the transition.  I will definitely be cancelling my account.   Save your money and do not invest your time setting up a Mighty Network because they will pull it apart, delete your content, burn all the money you invested in setting up the community.

The help search is worthless, trying to get an answer from a human is hard to find, then there is a long wait, then they are no help. The new format is a disaster.

Members can\u2019t see new posts and videos unless they filter the results, Getting that message to everyone is absolutely impossible when mighty networks don\u2019t even send the correct notifications when they\u2019re turned on.  They have huge updates all the time which mess with the layout of your network, Twice in a year I\u2019ve had to completely redesign my whole layout to accommodate their new changes, Losing hundreds of videos in the process. I pay for the top subscription with mighty networks so explain to me why, When I upload a new video it\u2019s only giving me the option to upload a 25mb video, Even on the strongest fastest wifi.I\u2019m sick to death of this now, It feels like it\u2019s every other day im on the live chat (because you can\u2019t call them) trying to sort another issue out, I t\u2019s cost me a ridiculous amount of money and members are leaving due to not getting on with the bloody stupid layout."

But they don't send me the invoice.I've asked them repeatedly to send us the invoice instead of just notifying us that we've been charged. They refuse. Instead they ask me to login to their platform, click on five or six things to get to the invoice to download it.The path to the invoice is so confusing that I never remember it from month to month, so waste a whole bunch of time all the time on just one invoice.No other supplier does this. But Mighty Networks... everything is possible. Last time I gave them feedback they said they saw it as a learning opportunity, and that they wanted to improve their service. I'm afraid to say I think that is marketing rubbish for people reading these reviews.Don't buy their replies to the negative feedback on here - it's all empty rhetoric. They either don't care about feedback, or their software team is so dysfunctional that they can't implement it despite the pleas of their customer service team."

I've found that the big social networks have become polarized, political, and promotional - big reasons most professionals are disengaging. I saw a promo video for MN and it seems intuitive enough that I signed up. Got immersed in it over the holidays and we're now up to 2,500 members, 20+ groups, and have just launched a series of courses. The platform is compelling (for the most part). The host experience leaves a lot to be desired. They push a lot out, yet seldom actually listen to their biggest advocates/power users. Have never heard from the CEO directly and the real-time support is useless. Also, few community managers are trained in MN, so if you're looking to outsource your community management, good luck! They're ramping up the user base to sell it to a bigger player like Salesforce, MSFT, or LinkedIn. Which leaves early adopters out in the dust."

          "Contenu": "Mighty Networks performs the core functions, but the administrative set up is lacking and some basic things don't exist. For example, as a UK business we need to charge sales tax for UK customers (but this tax doesn't apply to anyone outside the UK). There is no way to do this on Mighty Networks - their geolocation function doesn't work properly. We had huge problems assigning a custom domain to our Mighty Networks set up - it took months and hundreds of emails, with MN always pointing the finger somewhere else when it was because they have set things up strangely that the problem arose. Towards the end of the ordeal they told us that this problem had previously occurred with other customers, despite telling us for weeks that it was a problem specific to us.On the positive side of things, the user experience from a user point of view (not an admin) is good. Respondents enjoy using it and the course set up works well. If we were to start from scratch, while it wouldn't be a definite \"no\" to using MN, we'd strongly explore other options first as the challenges we've had have been incredibly frustrating."

I know you are developing the features and make use of the platform becoming easier for people outside the USA. I would like to see an improvement in customer service. Waiting 3 weeks for a response is not good. Also, your team is often not much of a help, when sending us to your videos or articles about the functionality. Sometimes these are not enough and we need someone to work with us on solving an issue.I also dislike how the platform does not give the host access to the members' email addresses. We use Mighty Network as a community platform. We bring people who sign up as members and when we want to have their email address, we have to pay MN the highest subscription available. We already pay to use MN and this should be enough to get contact details of our own contacts. I don't mean a fancy spreadsheet you offer (all nice but not a deal-breaker), just make the email addresses visible in the list of members. You block the access and I think this is not acceptable. Besides, I am pretty sure this also breaches the EU laws which you should respect since you operate in the EU too. Overall a good platform and I have trust in the team behind and your willingness to become better and friendlier for your users."

That creates extra steps for my team and has really prevented any of my clients (group members) from being able to share in the ways they want to. The inability to customize the dollar amount you want to charge for a plan is also frustrating as well as the big delay on receiving expense reports timely.

We were able to leverage the platform to create amazing engagement and outreach, deliver events, and host our growing webinar series. There are a few things that I would love to see as the platform expands.1. Virtual Event Platform: While there is an event feature, it is extremely basic. Essentially, you post a Zoom link, banner, and RSVP button. But we really need more in Events to support multi-day event that have concurrent sessions. Right now, there is no way to add a complex event schedule without adding about 80 individual events, which doesn't make sense. Currently, we've cobbled the Course feature as an Event Schedule for the entire 5 day event. I would rather not use another virtual event platforms in tangent with Mighty Networks.2. More Course Functions: While it is great that we can offer courses, the Course feature does not compare to your standard LMS. It would be great if there were options to integrate a LMS into Mighty Networks.3. Better Data Analytics: The platform needs more efficient and streamlined analytics on users."

New evolutions of MN keep making the platform more awesome for my clients and for me 2. The Mighty Hosts network covers all one needs to learn and grow a network--whether you are a beginner or been around a long time like me. 3. The customer service: responses to my request for \"host help\" are fast, efficient, and thoughtful. I'm not some user hunting forever for info in some cloud of other users (I HATE that!), I get real support from MN experts.  When this platform is the right fit for my clients to build their communities/courses/etc, I readily recommend it to them, too!"
