          "Contenu": "I tried to run a background check through them and got an error message after pressing the 'Go' button (the error looked like a bug in their system; some pdf file missing). I had assumed that this didn't go through and went ahead with a different service for the background check, only to find a few minutes later that they sent a completed report.Since I don't want to pay twice for the same thing, I requested a refund from them. I first tried to do that through their support email system, and they still haven't responded to that (after now around 15 hours; their website claims they'll respond within an hour). I also called a support phone number (which isn't listed on the site), which asks you to press '2' and then tells you to leave a voicemail.Overall, the one thing they seem to do well is billing their customers; the rest feels like an afterthought.Update:Contrary to the response from Landlordstation, I did *not* receive any response to any of the three emails I have sent them so far. I also noticed that they charged me three times (I hit the Submit button three times, and in each instance received the same error message). The only communication I received from them was an automated email asking me to rate their \"response\". (It looks like this was automatically generated by Zendesk.)I will now get my credit card company involved in order to cancel their fraudulent charges."

She called Landlord Station's toll-free help number during normal business hours and could only leave a voice-mail.  No one called back.  The situation was only resolved the next day, after I intervened and sent a stern message to Landlord Station.

Paying $65 to get this information is far too expensive to pay for that service as most tenants complain already about paying $45. Will be looking for another screening service.

Knowing that a background would be pulled, I had a few applicants decline this checkpoint and therefore the landlord was able to move to the next applicant knowing that the first likely had something to hide. As an agent, I am unable to pull credit and this allows the tenant to pay direct so you know you are dealing with someone who is truly interested and able to get a clear picture of the applicants background. My landlord was impressed as were the tenants on how easy and quickly the service assisted us all. The end result is easy to read and gives a recommendation with a green/yellow/red recommendation similar to a green light, yellow light or red stoplight. Highly, highly recommended.  Thank you Landlord Station, I will continue to utilize your service each time I represent a landlord (or tenant)."
