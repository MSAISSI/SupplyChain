          "Titre": "Waka Waka EA",
          "Contenu": "I have been trading Valeriia Mishchenko's Waka Waka EA for over a year and it had been consistently profitable. This EA was very easy to set up using the default settings but it also allowed the owner to personalize the settings to their own requirements too. I have always used the default settings and I had never had a losing month with the Waka Waka EA. I chose to trade with the medium risk setting that would target about 40% annual return. I felt that this would be a safe option as backtest data suggested that drawdown could reach about 20% on this setting. The Waka Waka EA was my number 1 recommendation due to the backtesting data, my own trading experience and the verified track record that was available.UPDATE: What I did not spend enough time explaining in my review was that there are inherent dangers of trading with a grid / martingale strategy. I was aware of these dangers and chose risk accordingly but many new traders may not know or understand the risks of trading with a grid / martingale strategy. The greatest danger is that the pair you are trading will begin to enter a long and sustained trend without a significant enough pullback to close out the basket of trades. This has happened with the NZDCAD down trend. I was very lucky and my trades closed so I personally did not suffer any loss but many other trades have suffered significant losses or lost their entire accounts. Even moderate / medium risk accounts did not survive. There may be ways to make Waka safer to trade but every customer needs to understand the risk that this strategy involves. The EA sellers total absence during this event was inexcusable and when she did finally turn up it was to issue platitudes about risk but not a single piece of advice for the traders who were losing their accounts based on her backtest information. Additionally, her admin person in the Telegram group has threatened to remove people from the group if they say anything negative about the Waka Waka EA."

Does anyone have a solution for this?I recently started using this trading robot, and I must say, it has shown great potential in terms of its trading capabilities. The robot's performance has been impressive, and I've seen some positive results. However, there's one aspect that's been bothering me.The robot seems to be locked into a pattern of opening exactly three trades per trading pair. While this might work well for some, I prefer more flexibility in my trading strategy, and I would like the option to set it to open just one or two trades per pair when needed. Unfortunately, despite going through the settings and trying various configurations, I haven't been able to find a way to adjust this particular aspect of the robot's behavior.I've tried reaching out to customer support, but I haven't received a response yet. If anyone else has encountered this issue and found a solution, I would greatly appreciate your advice or guidance on how to make the necessary adjustments."

If you set your the approiate risk appetie, then you are good to go with moderate consistent income on acceptable risk with lifetime earnings. YES LIFETIME!!! This is one of big USPs of her EAs, SHE UNDERSTAND THE RIGHT MEANING OF RISK MANAGEMNT, and for that reason I always recommend her products to any of my friends, relatives or any person in my FX circle. Finally, this is not a financial ADVICE. I am just sharing my opinion based on my personal experience and I can admit Valeria is the only author on earth that shares what she depend on on her real life trading."

It has made a constant 3 percent plus since late March and it\u2019s been stable by not experiencing massive drawdowns. I think the highest drawdown I\u2019ve experienced was about 8 percent but that soon went back down. My advice is if you purchase it is to put it on low to medium settings to avoid high drawdowns and to use a large leverage on a reasonably size account to maximise the leverage in your account.Martin and Valeriia\u2019s customer support has been exceptional. They get back to you really quickly and nothing is too much trouble for them.I highly recommend you look into buying one of her EA\u2019s."

          "Contenu": "I couldn't be more elated. The Perceptrader AI EA has quickly taken the top spot in my trading toolkit. It's rare to find a vendor who sincerely wants you to thrive. She personally responded to all my emails and was wholly committed to ensuring I got off to a good start. Everything has been going smoothly. Additionally, she provided a complimentary VPS, all the necessary set files, and recommendations for brokers. I'm thrilled with my decision to purchase her EA.BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE WITH PERCEPTRADER AI EA, HERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS I CAN ADDRESS:Does it promise instant wealth? No, it doesn't. While it doesn't promise overnight riches, its consistent small gains can yield a 1-3% increase in your equity month after month with minimal drawdowns.Is it a high-risk expert advisor? Indeed, it is. It operates using a martingale and grid system. Valeriia Mishchenko, the vendor, is transparent and candid about this fact.Is the AI feature a guaranteed win? Not at all. There's no silver bullet or 100% winning system in trading. However, this EA does have a higher mathematical probability of winning trades compared to losing ones. It employs the martingale and grid strategies to close the losing trades with marginal profits. These consistent small gains can accumulate significantly over time \u2013 akin to how many drops eventually fill an ocean. This is my interpretation of its mechanism.Can I simply set it and forget it? Personally, I wouldn't. Even though the EA is capable of independently analyzing the market, predicting trends, executing trades with predefined lot sizes, managing them, and then closing them, I always ensure I'm overseeing the process to confirm everything runs seamlessly.To conclude, while trading inherently carries risks, and I am by no means a financial advisor, possessing such an advanced and effective system certainly tilts the balance in my favor."

          "Contenu": "I was a little skeptical at first about Expert Advisors and automated trading systems on Forex, but it was something I believed could work if done right. There are a lot of Expert Advisors out there to choose from and I felt it was difficult to choose the right one to trust to earn you money consistently and not lose your money. So far after running Valery's EA (Golden Pickaxe) for just over 2 months, my account has grown by 7.64% which isn't bad, considering the money I invested to trade with would otherwise be sat in the bank losing value due to inflation and most banks where I am don't provide any interest on your savings. As with trading though, it is a risk and there have been losing trades but the important thing is that it is consistent enough to remain in profit despite the few losing trades. In the short time running this EA, it has made 47 trades and has an 83% win rate. Important thing to note is that you shouldn't be greedy and use risky settings for very large trades or to try to get more trades. Best to trade safe, have good entries with higher chances of winning and don't trade too large, so that your account can survive any losses and recover. So it's just to get the right settings with a level of risk you're comfortable with and then to be patient and watch the account grow over time."

          "Titre": "EA by Valeri - the best choice",
          "Contenu": "I have been using Valerie's EA for about six months. I got to know them well during that time and I am extremely satisfied with them. I have two EAs from Valerie - Waka Waka and Golden Pickase. I have also used other EAs. But Valerie's EA has no competition. I recently used an EA other than Valerie's and I lost a profit on one EA that Valerie's EA made. It was my mistake and I will not repeat this mistake again. So I decided that I won't use any EA other than her. EA Golden Pickase amazes me that it enters most of the trades with very high accuracy and mostly closes the trades within few minutes, this is unheard of. Only once in the six months I've been using Golden Pickas has he traded four grids - that's also unheard of. So GP makes a profit during the day and night even when I'm sleeping and, what's important, without fear of loss.Waka Waka is also a very high quality EA. He is very intelligent. He can place orders in the most appropriate places. It does not add grids after certain pips, but it evaluates the best opportunity to enter the trade and this is a huge advantage because the loss is not unnecessarily increased by unnecessary trades. The most grids I've had on a Waka Waka is four and that's a small DD. It is a very intelligent EA though. Waka Waka also trades during the day and at night and also allows for a peaceful sleep. But I can't say that about EAs that aren't from Valerie. I think I can judge this well because I have experience with the stock market since 2003 and I really have not come across a better EA than Valerie's. That's why I think it's pointless to look for the holy grail on other EAs and immediately test it for 14 days (Valerie offers it for free and you can see the results on the myfxbook website) and if you're satisfied, buy the EA. I wish you pleasant results and happy tomorrows with EA from Valerie."
