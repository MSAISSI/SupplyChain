There was no clear way on the website to make an alteration to the order. No big deal, I'll just call them on the phone and explain the situation.... For the rest of the day and the following day I attempted to get in touch with someone who worked there, calling multiple times, but was always kicked to voicemail. I did receive the product quickly, so they at least deserve the one star for that, but zero customer service, will not order from them again."

The calculation of the product value for canadian takes was inflated by All-Battery's shipping fees. All-Battery ships via UPS which added a broker's fee that was equal to the total inflated customs fees.  The final cost was an additional 85% of the cost of the product itself. I will NEVER USE ALL-BATTERY AGAIN  to ship to our canadian location.  If I had known the TOTAL or ESTIMATED cost, I would NOT have used their service."

I have got several batteries on ebey, the weight and the power has gone hand in hand. The heavier the more power and these batteries were supposed to be heavier than all that I got from ebey. It turns out they are no heavier than the best I got from ebey. I expected All Battery to be the standard from which to judge others. Turns out they are just as prone to over statements as ebey. At least on ebey I would probably get a refund."

Now I have to send the batteries back at my cost ($11). I still do not have enough rechargeable batteries for my 3 cameras.

When I had my order ready to check out, I input the discount code but a red banner came up saying, 'the code is not valid'. So, I tried it again. Then I called CS. That's when I was told that the code was no longer valid...and that there was nothing anyone could do. I was in retail for over 35yrs; I guarantee I would never let that stand in the way of good customer service.  I have had issues with Tenergy not calculating discounts properly in the past, but they always made it work. This time, they didn't and it has left a bad taste in my mouth."

I finally just purchased 2 more units with the hope for better results.  If they work about the same I will abandon Tenergy as a source.  This rating is for the battery pack.  May be a good product, but lousy support.  I would give much higher if the support was better."

In normal circumstances I would think this was unreasonably slow. However, this process was happening in the midst of COVID shutdowns, so I'm inclined to give the benefit of the doubt on slow response times. I will say that each response was good - they had good attitudes, asked the right questions, and ultimately did send me a replacement unit. That unit works perfectly and offers great controls and flexibility. Aside from the delays, the product and the support have been great. I'm very happy now (even if I was a little disgruntled for several weeks in the middle there!)"

          "Contenu": "\u2018Have been using Tenergy Power rechargeable batteries for some ten years now and will never look back. Measured capacity is always higher than stated, internal resistance is low, and they stay healthy longer than the competition in my experience. Tenergy also offers a wide range of characteristics for any given size. Only top manufacturers can achieve this because it takes research, dedication, and a variety of manufacturing methods.The same applies to Tenergy's range of chargers. I now use the TN456 because it's superior in every way to the brand name unit I had before. (You can find my rave review of it on Amazon.)What sets Tenergy apart as well is how they treat us. Several times it was a very senior engineer who answered my detailed questions in a delightful email dialogue. How rare is that in a world where chatbots and canned replies have taken over?Summing up, Tenergy Power cares about its products, its customers, and its reputation. You will be very pleased."

My alarm system technician uses the same Tenergy batteries I purchased; they last a really long time; and they fit perfectly in my sensor units. Since I live in a rural area, no one near me carries the exact type I need to replace the original batteries.  Plus, I was not only able to find the type I need, but I was also able to select the quantity I wanted--from only 1 on up. I opted for the 16-count package, since most of my sensors are close to needing battery replacements. I appreciate that Tenergy sells to individuals. Check out was easy.  Shipping was prompt.  I will definitely look to Tenergy first for my battery needs going forward."

I found it in there covered in dust and 3 dead NiCDs in it. After a quick interweb search I found Tenergy Power and they had a slightly better version of the original batteries, in stock, so I ordered them on a Friday... and received them on Monday. The solder tab 4/5ths C cells are an exact fit, a few mAhs bigger and had the option of solder tabs. The tabs made the refurb installation a breeze. I plan to actually use the tool this time around, thank you Tenergy Power for the super fast service and great quality batteries."

          "Contenu": "I have been using Tenergy Rechargeable AAA batteries exclusively, ever since I found them at Fry's Dallas location. I still have my Tenergy TN160 12 slot AA/AAA battery charger and I use it everyday! Tenergy Rechargeable AAA batteries have saved me about $1000 a year by recharging vs buying a 20 pack of conventional Alkaline batteries every week for $20.00 a pop! I'm service tech that works on commercial coffee equipment, combination fountain drink/ice maker equipment, etc., for a very large convenience store corporation. I don't use my flashlight occasionally, I actually carry two, with freshly charged Tenergy AAA batteries in both. Do the math! A 20 pack of Alkaline batteries is now over $22, so $22 x 52 weeks = $1144 a year, just for freakin' batteries so I can do my job! And on top of that, figure the carbon footprint for all of those batteries going into a landfill! Our beloved parents did not understand how they were polluting our land and water. All they cared about was making their fortune by stripping all the natural resources, then dumping all of their pollution back into the environment. They even said that the effects of pollution are nothing but lies, dreamed up liberal Left Wing radical hippies. It's all a lie they said! I dare them to say it now. Any way you look at it, rechargeable batteries by Tenergy outlast, out perform, are better for our environment and just make good sense for your wallet!"
