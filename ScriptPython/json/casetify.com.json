Nov 23rd they stated in my email to upgrade express shipping for me, and the other items are on the final quality check, will urge them to ship them ASAP. BUT! On Dec 21st I received an email notifying me, MY WATCHBAND IS OUT OF STOCK!! THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE!!!!! 2 items in the same order, INVENTORY ERROR AGAIN?!?!?! Please, do something! Are you keeping it for your mate to do a resell on your backdoor? Why are all the limited edition items having inventory error. Sorry, but I will never buy from you again, terrible inventory management and shopping experiences."

I\u2019ve had cheaper cases last longer. It probably started chipping within their 10 day policy but I never noticed it as it\u2019s not like I\u2019m looking at the back of my phone. Save your money and go elsewhere. I expected a lot more for a case I paid over $100. How they are still in business I don\u2019t know because this is highway robbery."

This, after I left repeated messages asking for an update (the website said my case was \"in production\" for nearly a month) without any response.  The service rep acted as if I had done something wrong and made no attempt to make me feel better about the interaction.  The design was cute, but it is easier and faster to get a comparable case elsewhere."

And sadly they've sent the wrong model (iPhone 14 Pro Max) which I'll need to wait for the right product. I've asked their CS team for a solution right away on 6 Dec and today is 15 Dec and I'm still waiting and the CS team is not able to advise the estimated delivery date, I need the screen protector urgently to protect my phone and now I've waited for nearly 3 weeks and still not yet sure when I can receive it. As their gold member, I'm disappointed to see the service like this."

I did not see the email as it went to a junk folder and they did not text me.  When my items never arrived,  I checked on my order.  I sent several messages asking why they canceled my order and the response was always the same,  that they didn't receive my payment.  Which was a lie as Casetify sent a credit to my credit card days after after I was originally charged. I asked for help in placing a new order, since I now lost the 30% promotion which was automatically applied. The responses just told me to apply the discount code, which I don't have. To receive by Christmas my only option was to pay for expedited shipping. I asked if they could do anything to help me,  since they caused the issue in the first place but no help was offered. A horrible experience that could have been made right by supportive customer service."

Absolutely unacceptable.Absolutely horrifying delay in delivery. I ordered the item on Nov 25 and still no sign of it. I had to send in enquiry twice to get a response that it is still in production. I should consider myself lucky if I can receive it in 2023. The one star goes to their attempt to speed up the delivery by offering free upgrade to DHL express delivery which would still take 4 days. I would never buy from them again!"

My first encounter with this brand was with a MacBook Case, which disappointingly arrived with a broken corner. More recently, I accepted a phone case from the same brand, offered as a gift by the company I work for. I was hesitant, but their claims of superior protection and appealing design convinced me to try again. However, my phone's back cracked yesterday while it was in their case, due to a simple accident. This brand advertises their high prices as a reflection of unmatched protection, but clearly, that's not true. I can provide photos of my damaged phone and the ineffective case. I strongly recommend avoiding this brand \u2013 don't waste your money!*As I mentioned, I got this as a gift from the company I worked for so I don't have any order number."

Do NOT buy from this company!!!!Customer order: 17226102Hi, Sorry but I have not yet received an email from Lauren Could she get in touch again please. Thank you!"

I didn't receive any further information other than the statement that my order is supposed to arrive between the 2nd and 9th of December. When I didn't hear anything else by the 9th, I messaged the customer service again. After some discussion I was granted a discount of 5% (about 2\u20ac) because my order hadn't even been produced yet. In my opinion that is not enough. It is now the 21st of December and my order has just now been delivered - almost a month later.The case is alright, but is not worth the price and the trouble."

I will never buy Casetify products again, there are so many better companies to select from. Edit: Since I can't reply to Casetify, here's my order number 1884635."

Almost a month later, they had still not been produced (in the order tracking section it said \u2018pending for production\u2019), so I wrote to customer service. They replied quickly, saying that they were quite busy, but they would produce and ship my order within the next week. They then offered me premium shipping for free, which I gladly accepted.Another week later, I checked on my order again because I still hadn\u2019t gotten an email saying that it had been shipped, and what do you know, it still said \u2018pending for production\u2019. I was angry. I had ordered one of the cases for myself, but the second one was a christmas gift, and at this point we were barely two weeks before christmas, and, knowing how long shipping can take, especially with casetify (since I had ordered from them twice before), I was starting to get really worried the case wouldn\u2019t arrive in time for christmas. So I wrote to customer service again, and I got a reply the day after stating that one of the cases I ordered was out of stock, so like whoopsies nothing they can do.I was furious. Why tell me that you\u2019re going to ship my order within a week, no problem, and then a week later all of a sudden you\u2019re out of stock? Didn\u2019t make any sense to me.Told them they were either lying to me or just sucked at communicating and to cancel the case that was \u2018out of stock\u2019 and just send me the other one. In the reply I got they just said ok, that case is cancelled, bye bye.I\u2019m still angry, probably never ordering from them again.Only reason I\u2019m not giving them one star is because the customer service was fast and I got premium shipping.Very very disappointed."

After almost two weeks\u2014the end of my estimated delivery window\u2014 I emailed them because the items still hadn\u2019t shipped. \u201cKali\u201d emailed me back to say one of the items was out of stock (in spite of still showing in stock on the website) and asked if I wanted to choose a replacement. I responded back within a few hours saying I did, gave the name of the new color I wanted, and asked if the price difference could be refunded. It has been six days since my response and nothing has happened. I have replied to the email daily asking for updates and still nothing. My order still shows as \u201con hold.\u201d I tried to reach out via the website due to their non response via email. No reply there either. Finally, I tried to connect with them via instagram DM and the two replies I have gotten are both \u201ckindly wait for our teammate to assist you via email to avoid any miscommunication.\u201d Hard to have miscommunication when no one is communicating at all. It feels like a massive scam to have a company charge your card for products before they ship, hold that money for weeks, and fail to address your issue after repeated attempts to contact them. I thought ordering a month before Christmas would be adequate but apparently not. At this rate if the issue is not resolved ASAP I\u2019ll pursue a chargeback with my bank. Update: within an hour of leaving this review, Kali reached out again to say that my emails had been \u201cscreened out\u201d and she hadn\u2019t received them. Not sure that feels truthful but whatever at this point. She indicated she updated my order with the new item I had selected and the order shows as in progress again. I leave my review at two stars as there is very little chance it will get here before Christmas in spite of having placed an order for two in stock items nearly a month prior. Casetify never reached out to me to tell me there was an issue\u2014I had to waste two weeks waiting for it to ship, contact them myself, and only then found out. Then another week with no response about fixing the situation. They likewise did not offer to expedite or upgrade shipping due to their error. And in all of this, the item they said held up my order STILL shows in stock in their website. What a disappointment, bordering on what feels like unethical behavior."

          "Contenu": "The lack of communication is frustrating yet you will send a ton of emails trying to promote your company. Don\u2019t inform the customer at all during the whole process. Customer has to log in online to check the status of their order. Can\u2019t stay signed in online either. Have to log in every time you go to the website. This is very aggravating. Then order says it\u2019s shipped and gives a tracking number. Yet you check the tracking number day after day and for days it will just say the label has been created but the carrier has not received the package yet. Don\u2019t say you shipped the item until you actually ship. That\u2019s false advertisement. It already takes your company weeks to ship. Then an additional week order 2 to actually physically ship the item. Your company just needs to do better. 3rd time I\u2019ve ordered from this company and the 3rd time I\u2019ve had problems with them. My girlfriend even placed an order once and returned the case due to it not working properly and taking nearly a month to get here."

His old case, an OtterBox, fits it just fine. But the one from Casetify will not fit it. And no other solution given by Casetify. They did send another case exactly the same to try and make it right. But that\u2019s it. I offered to send the 2 cases that didn\u2019t fit back so maybe I could receive one that actually fit. And no response to that.

          "Contenu": "I have visited the newly open casetify studio in Singapore (Somerset 313). And ordered 2 phone custom phone casing. At first everything was okay until to the point that the team got my orders wrong. I\u2019ve waited for 2 hours for them to rectify the problem to also know that I was overcharged by matching my receipt and my credit card charged receipt. I ended up purchasing more during that day. The staff is polite and helpful in trying to expedite my order and even suggested to revisit the next day for collection. But I didn\u2019t want to so I waited. I mean I don\u2019t blame them for the screw up. I am okay but specifically one girl staff I don\u2019t really like. She is rude, shows no respect to customer and even her colleagues. My friend also visited your store the very next day to place an order on my behalf and was served by her, she brushed off my friend and just tell him off that the design he requested is not available and there is no more stock for the item. In a very rude manner \u201cTHIS ONE DONT HAVE, THAT ONE ALSO DONT HAVE\u201d, and just walk away. She\u2019s the lady with a very big glasses and ducked face. I feel that even though it\u2019s very busy at the store and there\u2019s many customers to serve, basic customer service has to apply, talk nicely by all means. By talking nicely with rejection is still acceptable. I do not know why you guys hire such person with such bad attitude and rude customer service. Or maybe she doesn\u2019t like the job. I\u2019m a fan for casetify and I purchased many from Thailand without a membership registration, even though is very busy in Thailand but the politeness is there. Not saying your team is bad in SG. But that girl is rudddeeee to the max. I will not forget her and I won\u2019t want to be served by her ever again. Thank you for your time"

When trying to contact Casetify for support, their box to describe your problem has a tiny character limit. I loved the case (10/10) I got and if I need a new one I would order again, but I would NOT order any other item. The lens protector (0/10) I received was not sticky enough to adhere to my phone so it was a total waste of money. The kickstand wallet (6/10) works best without any cards in the wallet, and the design does not look as well as it was advertised."

I hope Mgt will take this issue by the horns & absolutely own their f*ckup.  Owning one\u2019s f*ckup is becoming more and more rare.

So, better. I like that Casetify categorizes according to device type and that they show the two types of each product. Prices are high but seem to be based on quality. I recently bought a high priced computer so I was looking for high quality and protectiveness. Both I have found in a previously purchased Casetify Iphone case. Because I have a tendency to drop everything, I am excited about the case with protective corners. I am happy to be able to afford Casetify and am excited to receive my new case."

Decided to give a try and purchased 3 cases.  However needed to return one to replace with another since my daughter bought a different phone from what she had originally planned.  Since there was no contact phone number for casetify it was all done through email back and forth.  It went smoothly and now just waiting for case to arrive.Quality of case is top notch and lots of great prints to choose from.  Only reason I took one star off is the shipping time takes rather long.  Also the back and forth email is time consuming rather than being able to speak with someone on phone.  Otherwise I would definitely shop from them again, I love my cases and great quality."
