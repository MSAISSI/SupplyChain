Then they told me to speak with my bank to ask for the refund. Sigh. I've lost over $1000 because they can't track down the refund (or see the double payment in one month). NOT so great afterall....I made an error when purchasing a package for my GlocalMe unit and when I realized my mistake, I asked for some help through the online chat function. \"Lorraine\" answered my message and was incredibly quick to respond, helped me in canceling the subscription and went a step further that I won't go into details about but it brought me to tears! She was kind, efficient, professional and a delight to work with. Definitely 5 stars for \"Lorraine\"!"

          "Contenu": "We purchased a 15GB 90 day global BIZ, and then traveled to Egypt for 2 weeks on a tourist trip. While at the beginning,  in the hotel in Cairo (there was a free WiFi anyway), the device seems to operate correctly, after the second day it stopped. During our entire 2 week trip it did not work. Our phones were not able to discover it, or when they were able to discover it, it was showing no Internet connection. It ruined our trip completely.  We relied on this device and it failed to provide the promised service. Immediately after we came back to the USA everything started working correctly again. The Customer Service guy said that they DO NOT GUARANTEE that the device would work in the foreign country. What is it? Why would anybody buy a device and a plan without a guarantee that it would work in the country they are going. Meanwhile, Egypt is included in our 15G plan and it does not state that it is contingent upon available service there. Now they do not want to give as a refund, because \" at some point the device has been working\" and some data has been used\". For me it is clearly an unfair business practice.Besides, their data service proves to be ways more expensive that any SIM card you could purchase in the other country. I cannot recommend GlocallMe. Not the GlocallMe device, neither their plans, nor their customer service."

          "Contenu": "I used to rent routers from GlocalMe, but purchased Duoturbo a year ago, and used it in Japan this month. I bought a Day pass for 10 days and 25GB $50 plan at same time as I needed full speed to use it for my work. I switched the priority from 25GB to Day pass while I was traveling to save data use, but somewhat while I was on Day pass, 25 GB balance went zero balance from 19.5GB. We did not use Duoturbo for streaming or youtube but 25GB plan x 2 disappeared without equivalent significant activities in just 2 days. This is ridiculous. I explained this to Lorraine and contacted her in two days over one hour to get credit for 19.5 GB but she said that their system showed data all used, so there is nothing she could do, and another technical staff would contact me in a day. This happened 5 days ago, but no action to resolve my problem has been taken by GlocalMe since then.I am scared to use their service now as I feel my data plans 25GB x 2 total $95 somewhat unreasonably disappeared but GlocalMe did not give me a fair credit, so I switched to my carrier\u2019s 15 GB plan which would keep my whole travel period. Now I feel safer as I have used only 3GB in 5 days on my carrier\u2019s plan with basically same intensity of use when GlocalMe showed I used 50GB in 3 days!  I will not use GlocalMe again as I cannot trust their data use administration as well as diligence of customer service any more."

But I\u2019m starting to see it.GlocalMe Data prices are high ... and what makes it worse ...only in USA currency which is a 1.32 times more expensive due to exchange rate. I hope GlocalMe still values Canadian customers...and honour offers/free shipping/bonuses etc.There is no ticket system, and no followup on complaints. Have to tell our story to each agent over again.GlocalMe Support team made a promise to resolve over phone, only to change their mind by email.  They then apologized for not honouring original fix....then offer a 1GB free for our inconvenience but still have not done this either.Do better GlocalMe!Please keep your word and honour your service commitments especially when customers have prepaid you!G4Pro customer"

She was very apologetic and understood CARA had created a bad situation .  Finally she offered us 10gb of free time for all the trouble and we agreed to continue .The next day we were surprised to find the 10GB of free time had vanished , we went to bed late setting it up and it was impossible to use up 8gm in one night .we called to complain only to get TECH DEPT spreadsheet BS that proved NOTHING, but our FREE Welcome package had vanished.The product it self seemed very good quality, but if they can steal your package then there is no point so we returned it .Of course who was put incharge of REFUND .... You Guessed it CARA the same NIGHTMARE employee She then decided to CHARDE US FULL price for the PACKAGE THEY Gifted US FREE  !!!! You cant make this up !!!I return the Equipment @ my own cost only to receive a email from CARA saying she had REFUND a CARD 8113  ...That must be her Boyfriends card she sent my refund to because i have NO CARD 8113.

          "Contenu": "I have had the GlocalMe device for a few years now and it has generally worked well.  I have purchased a few data plans over the years and this process has generally been smooth.  Unfortunately my last experience was anything but.  I used the GlocalMe app to try buy a plan but was faced with a shipping fee for the first time.  Why there would be a shipping fee when buying data for a mobile wifi device is beyond me.  I asked the in-app agent for advice and was told to use the pickup option (even though the pickup option had a disclaimer saying it wouldn't work due to COVID).  I followed his advice and purchased the plan with the pickup option but no data plan was delivered to me.  I then spent the next two hours with another agent trying to get my data.  Even though I provided them with screenshots of my receipt and invoice with an order number and email confirmation they could not \"find\" my order.  Eventually they said that my purchase had gone through their webservice (not the app) despite the fact I had only used the app for the entire process.  The agent tried to tell me to contact their webservice to sort the problem out but I refused.  He then said he would check with them himself and came back to tell me that I would get an email voucher in the next few minutes.  This took longer than expected.  Eventually the email (with help from the agent I suspect) came through and I received the data.  In the end the data purchase cost me two and a half hours of wasted time (definitely not worth the cost of the data).  I don't know what changed or if this was just a glitch but the whole process with the app was flawed.  Being charged a shipping price for buying data that is sent electronically is absurd and then having to spend more than two hours getting permission to access some electrons I had already paid for was galling to say the least.I liked the service that GlocalMe provided but if this happens again, I won't use it anymore."

I ordered this in advance of a trip within my own country (Ireland) in an area where service from my cell phone company was a little poor but other providers had better service.As I ordered from a German website, I assumed (incorrectly) that the hotspot would be coming from Germany. I received a shipping notice 4 days later stating it was about to be shipped from Hong Kong and had not even left their warehouse yet. Realising this was going to be too late for my trip, I emailed customer service to cancel my order because I knew it would be too late. I received no reply.Two days later I received another shipping notice that the hotspot had left Hong Kong. I emailed once again saying I no longer wanted the hotspot and that I had tried to cancel my order two days ago. Again, no reply.Unfortunately, I ended up having to order a different GlocalMe hotspot from Amazon.co.uk. I try to avoid using Amazon, and thought by purchasing from an EU site, I was supporting businesses within the EU. Of course, I was wrong, but the GlocalMe hotspot from Amazon arrived in time for my trip.Yesterday, 9 days since I sent my original email, I received a call from DHL saying I now owe \u20ac32 worth of customs charges for a hotspot I have repeatedly tried to cancel. For a hotspot I ordered from an EU website. As I live in Ireland, and ordered from a business posing as a German/EU business, I would not expect to pay customs fees.I have now been \u201cdealing\u201d with online customer service for the past two days who repeatedly tell me to \u201cemail customer service there is no other solution\u201d. I sent a third email yesterday. Still no reply and online customer service keeps saying \u201chold for an email reply\u201d. I have been holding for 10 days with not even a \u201cwe have received your email and are looking into the matter\u201d reply. My requests to escalate to a manager are met with \u201cno one is available.\u201d The online customer service person claims they do not know where the email response people are located or who they are. There is no phone number. They simply claim \u201chold for email.\u201dAs for the workings of the device itself, we were using it for a cottage with no wifi. It turns out my own mobile service works ok, but this thing absolutely chews through data. We went through 10gb a day for two days on GlocalMe, then my husband tethered everything to his phone and we were using far far less.Customer service is non-existent with this company.

          "Contenu": "I had purchased additional 50 GB for $99.99 and I never got it uploaded on my devise. The devise comes automatically with 8 GB which I used up in the first week. Not knowing that the other 50 GB were not loaded on my Devise, all of a sudden the devise was not working. I call the customer service company 3 times in one day, left messages and I also sent a detailed email to the customer service with all of the ID numbers on my devise to the email that was on the paperwork and never received a response. I called the following day again and someone answered from I think China. I explained to the person ( a lady) that I could hardly understand and in the background was another person talking Chinese to probably another customer on another line and she was talking so loud I could hardly hear the person I was talking to. The lady I spoke to wanted me to send the confirmation email that I bought the extra 50 GB which by the way it is only 36 GB I guess the 50 GB gets converted to 36 IN American. I never received the email confirmation of the purchase so I emailed a Screenshot of my account being charged. I call the lady back and asked if she received my email and she said yes but I would have to call back later after 1 AM My time because they were closed now. Unbelievable!!I called the next day and spoke to a Gentleman, his name was Max. He was very helpful. Had to explain everything to him again and again he asked me to send him the confirmation that I purchased the 50/36 GB. He said it would be in my Globalme app on my phone, but it wasn\u2019t. He then asked me for a code # on my devise which I gave him and he did see my email with my screenshot of the money being charged to my account and asked if it was ok that he could upload remotely the extra 50/36 GB to my devise. Duh!! I said of course. So that is what he did and the devise worked again. I had asked why didn\u2019t the lady I spoke to yesterday just so what he did. Naturally he said he didn\u2019t know but I should be all set. Bottom line, very poor customer service for this product. It took 3 days to get something resolved that could have and should have been done the first day of trying to reach the customer service."

          "Contenu": "The product is great but tactics are not. The simbox is supposed to save you \"Roaming\" charges and for a month it was that way but all of a sudden the calls out stopped!Upon checking with a CSR, I was told to download the update and when done, the update was flashing a message that now we need to subscribe to get the outgoing call and if we don't then the simbox will stop working by the end of Sept 2022.The subscription charges are discounted from $20 to $10 per month.I want to ask Golocal Management that if we are to pay you this amount per month then what is the point of buying your product as we may be on roaming for a month at maximum in a year that too not at a predetermined time then what is the use of buying your product because if we are to pay subscription charges of $120 to $240 per year weather we are on roaming or not then it is better to pay for roaming charges to the telcom company for that period, it is cheaper than your subscription charges!So my review is that a good product is in the hand of wrong company with illogical policies.Furthurmore, there is no option of payment by debit or credit card. Alipay, Paypal and WeChat pay is not used everywhere that too in Chinese!"

The data packages are expensive and if you have kids who watch YouTube and play games, the 12GB will vanish in no time, especially where there is bad or no signal. I believe there's a flaw somewhere that needs to be fixed. It is possible that the system will charge you for the reconnect attempts the device makes and that's unfair."

I did manage to make her old, dumb tv, into a smart tv. She has dementia and this keeps her mind busy so she does not get agitated and wonder around. But as I have investigated other data plans from other companies, I realize now that your plans are seriously over priced.

To say i am pissed off is a understatement. No return calls which I can\u2019t get through to anyone as it blocks my call\u2019s and emails!!!!! Well let\u2019s say that you have one of the best scams going. I\u2019ll be placing all the bad press I can do to prevent you from ripping off anyone else. If you have the balls to reply to this review and I will be happy to discuss a replacement for the one I didn\u2019t receive at no charge to me. Sincerely, Richard C Granger CEO QCB Appliance GroupNovember 29 2022I needed to update the review because it was not Glocalme\u2019s fault on the product not arriving it got lost in the post office box and I apologize for ranting about the way it was shipped. Upon talking with Cara from the support team she assured me that they would send a new wifi product and take care of the problem. After a week the product was located and it was connected to the internet and worked great but the amount of data it used for streaming was not what I wanted so I\u2019ll be returning it to the company for a refund. I have no problem with the product it worked great for the first few hours and one movie 9 gigs of data was used up. Not going to work for my situation. Sincerely,Richard Granger"

Also, sometimes if you switch networks it will tell you it needs to \u201cbind\u201d to an account because it disconnected itself from yours. But without WiFi you can\u2019t bind it.

I can only monitor one of the units at a time so I loaded one on my cellphone and the other on my iPad. While this works for me, it is a bit cumbersome. I have had hotspots from other companies that didn\u2019t work in many areas where we travel but the GlocalMe has not let me down. I travel in an rv and with my GlocalMe I operate a Ring doorbell and can use our laptops, phones, and pads. While it isn\u2019t cheap, when we choose to, we can stream our favorite tv shows from different online products. I am pleased with the quality and functionality of the hotspot devices."

I have had my device for years. My charging port needs to be replaced. I went through Glocal Me\u2019s website and inquired about an out of warranty repair. Instead of having me ship my device to them for a diagnosis and quote they were pressuring me to buy a new device. I declined and they kept repeating the same thing. I asked if they had a service and repair center. They said yes. I told them I\u2019m willing to pay for the repair. I asked for a location to mail my device to or provide me with an authorized repair center near me. I was told they had no authorized locations in the US; however, I just found one in New York. Again they were pressuring me to buy another device. I declined again and asked for a supervisor. I was told all were on vacation and I would have to wait a week until they return. I will never buy another device or continue to refer clients to them."

Glocalme Always gave me an optimal connection with a local  provider, even in the middle of nowhere. Not having to find out myself  which provider offered  good connections in a particular area and not having to buy multiple sim cards was very convenient. I just turned on the Glocalme hotspot and we were able to use 2 mobile phones and two tablets simultaneously every time. I have occasionally also  used it as  a spare battery to recharge my phone. Topping up my bundle on line was convenient too. Glocalme has a good choice  in bundles of  varying validity times and sizes for  the different  countries and area's. I can recommend it for all travelers.It may not be your cheapest option but it is convenient and trustworthy when you travel far away. I absolutely recommend using the Glocalme G3.  But remember to also get a good quality VPN subscription before you leave! Hans Roelofs, The Netherlands. Sept. 26 2020."

It\u00b4s easy to configure, easy to use and it\u00b4s great that you can buy data for so many countries. Most of the time we\u00b4re travelling in a group from 2-4 people (everyone with smartphone and laptop) and so we can share this connection on trips and out of the hotel where there\u00b4s normally internet through hotspots.Even when you have some issues, the helpdesk from GLocalMe is awesome (especially Diana!) and can fix any problems really quick and friendly.Thanks - the world was in need for that product!"

For some reason it wasn\u2019t loading webpages and just didnt seem to work so i ended up using hotel wifi. I thought maybe my device was outdated with all the 5G products now. So i contacted Glocalme online about my experience and was messaging with Lucas to ask whether i needed to update my device to a new 5G. He was very helpful and gave me a free data plan to test my G3 again in the UK. It is working fine so possibly it was the area i was in up North that didnt have good wifi reception but i have used my G3 all over the world previously. Anyways, i will see how i get on but i wanted to say thank you to Lucas for his helpfulness."

More recently, I updated my unit to the Duo Turbo with Glocalme in anticipation of working on Semester at Sea (2023) and needing a portable Wifi while I was traveling to many countries (and being out at sea) and dependent on Wifi for my job. Many of us on the voyage needed reliable Wifi, but I was the only one with a Glocalme Duo Turbo unit and experience with this company. While on a ship, we went from Dubai to India to Kenya to Jordan to Croatia and further. Whether we were out at sea or in port, Glocalme made sure I had Wifi - and it did not cost me a fortune, in fact, it was incredibly affordable. Once I got back to the US, I had to be in a remote part of Michigan where Wifi access was poor. I did not think that in the US the Glocalme service was an option, but it was. And so I bought a 30 day package and I am using my computer, streaming, downloading files and feel very supported, here in Michigan. Just today I texted with Diana (a real person) and she helped me fix some issues which were not Glocalme issues, they were my Settings issues. And she gave me a discount code so I could further reduce my costs. I cannot say enough good things about this company. I live and work in the US and in over 90 countries in the world. There is nothing like Glocalme. Their products work, their prices are very competitive, and their support personnel are amazing. Thank you, Glocalme. I owe my professional life survival to you!!"
