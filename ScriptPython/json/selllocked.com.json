They use the slowest shipping so it took a week there and a week back after I refused their offer. Don't waste your time with their low offers and stingy inspections. I sent it out to ReCell.io and they accepted it for $100 more than SellLocked. Was delivered and inspected in under a week, even during the week of Christmas."

I'm a realistic individual; however, (for example) one of my phones was estimated at $440 and I received $110 for it. This while my contact person said \"it was in great condition\". Lastly, I boxed 4+ phones together while attaching the documents your company requires for each. Today I was told they were not packaged properly and that may have effected my reimbursement. Frankly, I'm a bit disappointed."

I would still use this company again if I need in the future."

I waited 3 days it says payout was completed may 2 so in the email it does say payment can take 48 hr to 5 days but it mostly 48hr. So that means may 4th I should have recieve it I waited today which made it 72 hr after may 2nd I email josh he said \u201cit\u2019s look like they revised the Payment\u201d  it was fixed right there and then and I was able to get paid the same day I emailed them which is may 5th. I like how fast they answer my only issue is they could have email to that there\u2019s issue with my payment cos it does say 1-5 business day u can receive ur payment so u wouldn\u2019t really know if there\u2019s an issue with ur payment or u have to wait the whole 5 days but they reliable communication they are understanding so I give it 4/5 star just wish they was on top of the payment because I felt like if I didn\u2019t email them they wouldn\u2019t have told me there\u2019s issue with my payment . But I\u2019m glad they answer on time and I needed the money for my daughter birthday may 9th so the money came in handy will be using it again thank you"
