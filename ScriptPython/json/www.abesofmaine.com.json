          "Contenu": "Absolutely disgusting. We bought a Nikon d850 from the website for $1649. After order, they called my mother (who was buying this as a gift to me) to sell her an upgrade apparently to the American version for another $950. When I called to inquire what she's buying for another $950, Michael explained that we were purchasing an import model with no accessories and buttons in Japanese. He claims the description said import model, which it does, but I've previously owned an import Nikon d810 with no missing accessories, nor buttons in Japanese, NOWHERE in the website's description of this item does it indicate that \"import model\" means it will arrive in a white box, with no accessories, and buttons in Japanese. And the ass on the phone doesn't even let you speak to express the utter crap of a scam this racket is and how they ought to put this information in the description. Absolutely reporting to the Better Business Bureau."

Shop elsewhere from well known companies not companies like this one for sure !!!! YOUVE BEEN WARNED!!!!"

Their website is purposely inadequate and misleading which prompts a call from their sales department attempting to up-sell to the product believed to have been originally ordered, only at a much higher price. When I told the salesperson to cancel my order because I was turned off by their tactics, he wished me good luck and hung up on me. I found the same item on Amazon (slightly higher price) with next day delivery, opposed to the three to four weeks from Abe's of Maine."

While on the phone they tried to upsell me into buying a package instead of the product I ordered, telling me it is oversold (even though it's still listed as in stock even right now). So I can either stick with the original order if I'm \"okay with it taking 3-4 weeks,\" he said, or take a package deal with an extended warranty and an accessory for $100 more, which will then ship in three days. This recalls the Bad Old Days of internet ordering. I will absolutely never, never buy from Abe's of Maine again."

I have ordered three cameras from Abe's in the past and it was usually fairly straightforward - certainly more so that all the other places in the NorthEast. But the last two times I tried to order a camera and now a lens it has been a pain. They dragged the shipment of the camera to the point where I ended up canceling and buying elsewhere. Today again, I tried to order a Sony lens that was the international model (which I couldn't care less) the website says in stock and ready to ship - well of course it wasn't. They conveniently wanted to send me the US model for more money. As I matter of principle I canceled again and will now buy somewhere else. There is nothing more irritating to me than somebody wasting my time - after all that is something I cannot buy."

          "Contenu": "I placed an order online over the weekend. The price for the camera I wanted was better than other online retailers. The order was accepted, and I received confirmation. When Monday came around, I had voice and email messages from someone named Ted at the company saying he needed to talk to me to confirm my order. I have no idea what needed to be confirmed, as everything seemed straightforward online. Other reviews here concerned me about the point of such a conversation. I attempted to return the call during Abe's operating hours, and ended up on hold for more than a half hour. I sent an email reply to Ted, saying please just process my order and get it sent. I received no acknowledgment of that email, just another voicemail saying he was returning my call, and that I should call him to confirm the order. I tried one more time, and again found myself on hold for an extended period of time before I gave up and disconnected. I sent an email to every address I had for the company and directed that my order be canceled. I received confirmation that it was canceled.Insisting that a customer speak to you on the phone, then having nobody available during business hours to take the call is unacceptable customer service. I don't want to make a major purchase from that kind of retailer. When the awful hold music is interrupted with \"Your call is very important to us,\" it's just insulting. If my call were important, the company would have an appropriate staffing level to answer it. Also, when I reply to an email quite specifically, but do not receive any acknowledgment of that, it's another red flag. Finally, this company is in New Jersey, so the name is totally disingenuous.I didn't experience everything some people have posted about here, but everything that happened suggested we were headed in that direction. Why else would they be pushing to speak on the phone? I'm relieved I was able to cancel the order. I'd rather pay more and have peace of mind that I'm dealing with someone more reputable."

Next day I got a call from AOM to verify my purchase and address. During that call they told me that the model I ordered was an Import model and it comes with no warranty and no accessories. I remarked that I knew that when I ordered the camera. They told me they don't recommend me buying an Import model and asked how many batteries I wanted and if I wanted an SD card or possibly their BUNDLED version for over $1000. I said Just ship me the camera that I ordered and they then told me they would ship it out in a couple weeks. I asked why a couple weeks when I was told before I ordered, there were plenty in stock. He then said \"You ordered the Import model which has to come from China so it will take a couple of weeks to get the item. I told them ok \"I'll wait a few weeks\" and ended the call. The next day I got a call from AOM asking if I ordered a camera and I said yes why? I was told that there was a problem with the shipment of that camera to them because they should have arrived that day but supplier is having issues shipping imported items but they would give me  three options. 1. Buy U.S. model with warranty for a couple of hundred more 2. or I could order a Bundled item for $500+ more or3. Cancel my OrderI chose option 3 and will be watching the Credit Card account closely to be sure they do not charge me. I checked order status on line and it does show Status CancelMy Recommendation: Don't waste your time with AOM"

But when I got the package, it was gray market Camera.  I called the Canon and they said the camera was not supported by US Canon.  They charged me extra money for gray market camera.  And their customer care is very poor when I called several times regarding this matter.  Also there was no warranty card and the charging station was after-market product."

I purchased a TV that listed insurance as optional, but 5 days later receive a phone call to finalize the purchase and I was then told an additional $300 insurance policy was required in order to ship the unit. Second, delivery date was inaccurate along with poor communication about its ETA. Definitely feels like a SCAM website with poor customer service. Also, scary this is a company that is linked with CNET.com which is how I originally stumbled upon them."

You will have to call or they will call you before charging and shipping item.   2.  Shipping is \"free\" but insurance will be around $250.50.   3. When they quote the $250.50 insurance they will say something like twenty-five fifty which in layman terms means $25.50.  Very deceptive.   Or they will up-sell you accessories that have a $1000 percent mark-up.   I respect that they are in business to make money and  In all you may get your TV or other item at the lowest cost but who wants to deal with a company that is deceptive and lacks transparency.   I don't."

The import models do not, and they trick you into buying it with a mark down on the price. Also, inventory isn't reflected accurately on the website. So I bought an expensive camera that Im now going to have to wait 4 weeks to receive, at the exact same price I would have gotten from B$H - which would have been sent immediately.I also bought an expensive lens that is also going to be shipped in 4 weeks. B&H always has an accurate inventory so there are no surprises. I make a living out of photography so this is my work tool. I will have to wait 4 weeks to get it, postpone jobs, as I cannot cancel this order. Not worth the bs"

I only found this out when I called (at their request) to confirm my purchase, and their representative asked what battery I wanted to buy. When I asked if this was in addition to the included battery, he told me the camera didn't include a battery and was an import. He offered the US model for the same price as other retailers, but if I had known, I wouldn't have bought from them. I wish I had bought directly from Canon instead; for the same price I would have received the camera, a memory card (which Abes did include), and a lens adapter, which I had to buy separately from Abes. So it ended up costing $70 more all together, and the adapter is probably an import item as well. My complaint to customer service was ignored."

I called their phone number, because I understood that they wanted to confirm my order, it was a $900 purchase. However, they tack on more and more accessories in order to get you to spend more money. Instead of spending just under $940, I spent $1,099.99 because I decided to get the retail box that came with all the accessories.Instead of giving one star, I gave two because I still got a product that was a tad cheaper than what was being sold in retail. I haven't received the product yet, so I have no word on the quality of their products. But if it's still sealed, I am hoping that there is nothing to worry about. This is a grey market, so you're not buying from an authentic dealer. They do \"bait and switch\", so know what you are getting into, and do not accept their extra deals. This company is the equivalent to a used car salesman."

Abes will email you and tell you that they require insured shipping on TV's.  They state this is obvious in the literature.  You can find it after they point it out but it's not obvious.  They do this with a message that says \"Thanks again for your order! We very much appreciate your business with AbesofMaine.  Please call us at 800-992-2237 EXT 272. We need to confirm your purchase. That's win they give you the bad news about the uplift for insurance, but not how long the shipment will take.  I got an ear-full from a very poor CSR named Jeff Stevens for missing the fine print - obvious to him because he works this every day.  If not for another, nicer sales rep, I would have (and probably should have) just cancelled the order.  For my area, Abe's uses AM Home Delivery.  The TV was purchased on Sept 22nd.  AM Home Delivery needs to consolidate loads for shipments to Virginia (via Charlotte, NC - Note: the routing was New Jersey to Charlotte, NC, then to Richmond, VA).  It took 17 days for this purchase to make the 5 hour drive from New Jersey.  You know none of this when you purchase the TV."

I didn't read the fine print that the camera was a gray market camera and the sales person was trying to sell me a retail model which I believe is also gray market, however the price for the retail model is the same as all the other online resellers (that are authorized resellers). I was told that I should get a third party warranty and I can't find any information on the third party warranty to find out if it's reputable or if there are reviews on it. I received no tracking number for my package and was told the lens is on backorder and should come in a couple weeks. So I'll have a camera body with no lens eventually and I don't know when it's shipping and I can't track it. I do know my credit card was charged, that part is certain. I believe the critical information should be more apparent. Let customers know if items are in stock before they place the online order, clearly mark items \"International Model\" and describe what exactly that means, last, explain how your third party warranty is reputable and will provide the customer more value than if they bought from an authorized reseller. I would also benefit from information that shows you respect the treatment and storage of products the same way an authorized reseller would."

          "Contenu": "I started writing a whole story about my interaction, but then got bored with it. Long story short, after placing my order I received a call the next evening posing as a security check to make sure I actually ordered the camera. (After spending who knows how many thousands of dollars online over the years, no one does this.) The truth of the call was to get me to upgrade to the model I thought I was purchasing originally. (I was looking for the US model, they were selling the international model. Not labeled very well.) Also, they offered to \"upgrade\" my SD card to a faster model. The whole call just felt pushy and unnecessary. \r After seeing my revised invoice, I see they've \"upgraded\" the SD card from my chosen Sandisk brand to a no-name brand; a clever way to boost their profits. I called back and expressed my frustration with that little bait-and-switch. On top of this, when I actually got the camera (a Canon 6D), the box labeled was one with the camera and 24-105mm lens kit. They didn't accidentally upgrade my order. They simply sent my camera in a different box. (I presume they sold off the original included lens and made a tidy profit at the expense of their customer's buying experience.) Certainly not the end of the world, but also not something I'd expect from a reputable seller. \r Maybe if the original caller was more up front and had a modicum of phone skills, I wouldn't have felt burned. But given their practices and my experience, I'd rather pay a tiny bit more and actually enjoy the process."

(ie. no USA warranty).2-  They require that you call them to ostensibly \"confirm you order\".  This leads to an up-sale session. Some people will find this objectionable, like having to worm you way out of a timeshare presentation before they let you check into your room.3-  I felt the sales was at best misinformed about certain technical issues when trying to sell me an aftermarket battery for me camera.    Abes does what they do to maximize profit, as any business should.  I would hope they change their ways about how they operate to a model more like a B&H,  thus building a truly good and lasting reputation."

Getting one Nikon 1230mAh (standard) and a generic 1800mAh battery 2 stars...explanation that these two batteries offer the same performance and are 5 hour battery. .1 star. They may have the same performance despite different ratings because one is Nikon and the other is poor quality generic but the Nikon is the standard battery not an upgrade and the generic can be had for much less elsewhere.  While the camera is good and at a good price. I would not buy here again. I cancelled the remaining order which I hope will go smoothly.  UPDATE - After the initial 1 star review, we received yet another call from Abes concerned about the low rating and the customer experience.  They offered a second 5hr 1800mAh battery free of charge to remedy the situation. Since they were willing to resolve the situation the overall experience has been upgraded to 3 stars.  Would have been five stars had they delivered what their website said was available when we ordered, and even with that four had we not have to deal with repeated phone calls to resolve the issue."

What's not to love about Abes of Maine?!They have a huge variety of TVs and electronics. From prior orders, never had a single issue with price, service, or product. Looking forward to my new TV.Edit:  After writing this review I got a call from Abe's as they wanted to verify my purchase. The agent was polite and friendly but there was an effort to up sale several items. I normally wouldn't take away a star, or in this case 2 stars for that, but when I passed on buying extra insurance, the agent told me I would fully responsible for the product, any damages that occurred, and it could not be returned. I told him that Abes provides a guarantee for all shipping per their website but he stated it didn't apply to TVs. I found this statement to be untrue. I deducted 1 star for this.I was then told they will ship the item when it arrives, having been told they had it in stock. I was quoted as delivery in 7 - 10 days but when the agent called he said 3 - 4 weeks. I felt (without evidence) that if I had purchased all the up sale items, I would have gotten my TV sooner. Left me with the impression that I was being penalized for not buying more. From that conversation I deducted another star. Below is their policy for the site and note there isn't an exception:Shop with confidence at Abe's of MaineServing our customers for over 30 Years!PRODUCTS ARE:Factory freshIn a secure cartIncludes all manufacturer supplied accessoriesMost orders are shipped within 24-48 hoursYou will not be responsible for boxes lost or damaged by the shipping carrier"

I quickly received an email from them to call to verify the purchase. Since it was a large amount of money, I assumed that was the issue. I called and was immediately transferred to the person who emailed me. Ted was incredibly helpful. I had accidentally ordered a European version of the camera and lens. He not only helped me, but also honored the sale percentage on the original order. He then got it out rush shipping at around 6pm! They registered the warranties and everything. I couldn't be more pleased with the service we received from this small business. I highly recommend!"
