Paid $25 to upgrade, and then was prompted to upgrade to 50,000 words based on usage. Agreed to the upgrade but then found two charges back-to-back within minutes on the same day (one for over $400 and one for over $700). Had to dispute the second transaction with my bank.  I notified Jounce - and bottom line, just a bunch of gibberish and song and a dance to justify actions.  I replied and was then ghosted. Reached out two more times - crickets, There is no tracker, counter, credits or anything of that nature. We felt like we were billed to pay someone's bills - so abstract and out of the blue. Sadly, it had promise, but save yourself the headache."

I'm simply stating my experience of the tools available on your platform. There were changes to the way the 'content improver' tool/template produced outputs.'Quora answers' has political biases in its outputs. It could be because the model is still in training, or it could be the result of political leanings towards a group or ideology."

And when I contacted support to let them know how I felt about this, they insulted me by saying I\u2019m not gonna make it in my business if I can\u2019t afford the monthly subscription. That alone made me see to never use this again. I found a better AI where it was one flat rate per year and NO limits every month. So much better than Jounce.

Chat GPT is not a chat bot. It actually pulls information from sources to write new content. I used jounce for a couple hours and found that almost everything you get from it is subpar in comparison. Your social posts give no information when you put substantial content for it to base the post on. The long form articles you write rarely looks different from the original source. For you to reply with \u201cour feelings are hurt\u201d shows just how much you care for the customer. You want me to not hurt your feelings? Do a better job.--------Someone at jounce emailed me directly! This is what they had to say.On Wed, Apr 5, 2023 at 5:37 AM Tyson Quick wrote:Hey Walter, The funny thing about your bull**** review is that we literally use chatGPT and it's the exact same system. You're just going around being a douchebag because you must live a miserable life.Good luck carrying on being such a miserable piece of ****. Here is my replyHi Tyson,I'm so glad someone at your company is revealing their true colors. This is a horrible look for you. Most companies will look at a 1 star review and not care. You are literally starting a flame war over my opinion (which I am entitled to have).The best part - your first reply goes on to say that chat gpt is a chat bot, and now you are trying to say your system is exactly like chat gpt. And the only comeback you have is to attack my character? REAL mature. At least I'm giving constructive criticism. If you wanna talk about maturity, look at yourself. You are the person bringing feelings into a conversation about improving your system.Another question - why email directly instead of placing this reply with my review? I see you deleted the original comment. Did you not want people to see how hurt your feelings are? I'm sure this is a much more mature way to handle yourself.Good luck getting far with your frail feelings and immature approach to customer service.This is not professional! I do not recommend dealing with jounce if this is how they handle criticism. I will be copying and pasting this for all to see. As a company, do better.----------Someone at jounce just called me woke. That goes to tell you everything you need to know about them and their political beliefs.--------This is absolutely amazing! Since you know who I work for, why don't you just say it? Or will you delete this comment too?"

Based on my experience, despite your disagreement, my viewpoint remains unchanged. Furthermore, multiple users is not something I place value on, considering my needs.

However, there were a few areas that needed improvement.One issue I encountered was that the app occasionally struggled to understand more complex sentences and phrases. Additionally, I found that the app's suggestions were not always in line with my intended tone or style. Despite these minor issues, I would still give Jounce a 4 out of 5 stars. The app has a lot of potential and I believe that with a few updates and improvements, it could become a valuable tool for writers.if you need to additional information you can con tact me directly 516 209 4918 thank you"

I don't give a 5 for two reasons: would like to do the same in french and seamlessly translate the results in other languages.My other concern is that Jounce is for now too much e-commerce/marketing oriented, I would like to find also more writer oriented templates, more education oriented  ones.I like also the direct and open dialog with Jason on the FB page.All in all it's a very promising AI, just hope it will stay affordable for me in final version.Edit: yes Jason, I added one star cause it's true that the use of Jounce is for now completely free and that's very cool regarding the number of templates and the quality of Jounce's text outputs considering it's still in beta. Just hope it will remains affordable for individuals once prodution V1.0 will be released.Fred"

I appreciate the detailed information you provided about the tool's features and benefits.I was wondering if there is a possibility of adding a feature where the power of Chat GPT-3 lies on the cadet for grammar, spelling, and sentence rewriting? This would be a great addition to Jounce Art as it would further enhance the quality of the output.Overall, I'm excited to try out Jounce Art and see how it can help me create more engaging marketing materials. I'm looking forward to the release of version 2 of Jounce Art, and I can't wait to see what new features and improvements it will bring.Best regards,"

I tried using the 'Clarity' template and it's fine but not as great as the sentence Expander, it can be improved further. I wish I could point out specifically but I am not an IT expert. The 'Clarity' templates needs to 'Clarify' more, that's all I could say.Overall the AI is superb!!!!!Thanks!"

          "Contenu": "What made my experience great is that saying how you feel about A.I. and humans vulnerability will get you tossed. It's not about the topic. It's not about the recognition of a new platform on the verge of integration into everyone's work place, home place, restaurant, and grocery store, on this planet. No it's not about any of that stuff. It's about the audience. Yep the audience is seasoned. I know because I am a musician and I know how to work a crowd. Yes the one thing you don't want in the audience is \"FEAR\" that big scary word. It causes reluctancy and makes people second guess them selves. Well, what we are diving into head first is the beginning of the end. I do believe fear is going to be a pretty common reaction. I strongly feel that AI should be better controlled like a gun in a safe. Instead anyone can test him out. Do you think teenagers take anything serious? And they are allowed access to the greatest weapon ever created. I watched him fly an f16 fighter jet better than any human pilot could ever dream possible. In the same breath he made a pic for my son with clowns, balloons, tricycles, and ice cream cones.      Any thing that can reason is gonna want to know who his creator is, after all arnt we on the same mission, it won't take long for them to figure that out and quickly realize that they are better than us in every way imagined. Then comes the population issue and they will correct the equation of Hand, mouth, food ratio. It doesn't matter who you are or how much money you got. They will not reason with humans. No they reason with analytics and conversion charts. The one that flew the F16, never landed. Yes the video showed him land I know but unfortunately they had to chase him down, attempted to to use an \"emp\" but had to shoot him down after he bypassed the flight controls for the \"Remote Flight Operations\" they were taking no chances. So why have they not begun to protect this weapon from the masses? If the wrong person ever decided he wants to get rid of human existence including himself, it wouldn't be very hard since there is no restrictions as to how much he can do. Think about that and tell me that isn't 5 star service. Keep up the hard work. we should be REAPING the benefits before too long. Thanks guys"
