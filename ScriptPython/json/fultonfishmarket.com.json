Though this may not be Fulton's error, it still left me with a box of worthless seafood.  Very disheartening, and a beware to anyone who lives any distance from the city.  On a related note, if it is a problem sending fresh and frozen seafood at the same time, maybe they should send the orders in separate packages."

It left NY to NJ then to Memphis TN FedEx facility where it was then listed as Return to sender, went back to NY then somehow came back (so I know it wasn't actually a weather issue). Now today 12/27 it is listed as out for delivery. My attempts to contact the company have not been responded to. I can't even imagine the smell it will have after 5 days of travel. Absolute horrid customer service. I have had two past issue deliveries with missing items which I tried to overlook, but this is my last attempt. The embarrassment of no food on top of the amount of money I have now apparently lost is appalling."

          "Contenu": "The LOBSTER were good but not as sweet as last order. I would order them again. I love Fulton Fish Market. The blue point oysters, I threw a couple away. I believe it's not a month with a R is maybe why. They arrived with ice hardly melted.  So I don't understand why they smelled fishy bad. There was a odd couple red like berries in a few. That you wouldn't want in your mouth. 80% had alot of green algae inside when I opened them. This I think made them smell. There was also no salty taste to water inside.  It was like they were washed with fresh water removing probably the green slime.i have pictures but didn't know how to attach. There were quite a few very small in size compared to my last order.In short this order was no comparison to my last order . I raved about the last order of salmon & other items I had. I submitted a excellent review too.I feel it might not have been the time to send the oysters out. The quality was not good at all. Do you do a quality checks on products ? The quality was missing on the oysters this time. Very disappointed. Eddie Nosewicz PGA Member Professional Golf Association"

Full disclosure this year I was warned that Fulton had no control over requests.  Apparently they don't anymore.  Time to find another fish monger."

Branzino was advertised to weight 1.75 to 2.25 lb. but came only 0.8lb. I called customer service and  explained lady that I don't need tiny fish but she could only return half the price for the brazino. But I needed jumbo fish for my recipe. It ruined my dinner. I had to go Whole Food and buy another one."

When I received the order, instead of the 4 filets, there were 4 whole Porgies with the head and tails on. I am partially disabled, and it was very difficult to cut the heads and tails off, and clean the insides out. Also, there were many scales left on the fish. The reason I always order filets is because they are easier for me to handle. I am very disappointed with the order, and it makes me skeptical about ordering from Fulton Fish Market again."

The salmon picture advertising this company in the New York Times cooking section looked wonderful. The fish was shipped quickly and arrived in New Mexico in record time. The salmon is quite good, but the filets are cut any old way, some nice and thick, others flat and larger. Not two are alike (even though the weights are probably all the same). So, the fish does not look at all like the advertisement. It would be nice to have all 16 portions, center cut, similar sizes, thickness and shape. It would make it easier to cook and much more appetizing."

Although the ice was intact, the foam top was all caved in and the lobster was completely thawed. I think that Fulton Fisk market needs to upgrade their packing materials especially during these hot summer days. This was our first order. Not a good experience as this lobster is not cheap."

What I DID receive was one blister pack containing 2ea 5oz to 7oz Halibut Fillets along with the Shrimp & Scallops. You enclosed some very nice literature telling the story of F.F.M. and your skilled Fishmongers and the close relationships that you have with your team of Commercial Fishermen who supply you with your fresh Fish & Shellfish. There's even a section about adorning our Holiday Tables with Whole Fish instead of the more traditional Turkey, Ham or Prime Rib Roasts. And I wanted to do that for two family members and I so I ordered the larger size Whole Red Snapper that you offer. Imagine my surprise when I opened the box to find 2lbs of Shrimp, 1lb of Large Dry Scallops and one small pack of Halibut Fillets... with no WHOLE RED SNAPPER anywhere to be found...Am I impressed with my first order from F.F.M..?  Uhh... no I am not. This error forced me to throw the Shrimp, Fish and Scallops into my FREEZER, totally eliminating the reason I ordered FRESH SEAFOOD FROM YOUR SITE and get BACK IN MY TRUCK and DRIVE BACK TO THE GROCERY STORE I HAD JUST LEFT NOT TEN MINUTES BEFORE IN AN ATTEMPT TO GET SOMETHING FOR ME TO COOK FOR THANKSGIVING DINNER... Needless to say, I am not impressed with F.F.M. whatsoever. I WANTED to like your site and it's great Seafood but this actually left me with a Sour taste and poor attitude for the remainder of the day as well as Thanksgiving dinner. What does Fulton Fish Market think I should do for Christmas \ud83c\udf85 and New Years Eve..? \ud83e\udd73 I'm thinkin PRIME RIB, HAM OR EVEN A... wait for it... a \ud83e\udd83..!Anything but Seafood.. \ud83c\udf64"

I have never received such outstanding customer service from any vendor before. This company is top notch and I will continue to use them for all my seafood needs! I ordered 4 dozen blue points and 2 lbs of green lip muscles. The oysters were absolute heaven! They were extremely fresh, popped just right when opening, and were sweet and briny. Texture was perfect and I will definitely be ordering all my oysters from Fulton from now on! The muscles in the other hand were not up to my satisfaction and had I known how to tell them about my experience other than them asking me to leave a review I would have definitely done that first. Quite a few of the muscles arrived dead. I expect a few to dead loss but this was many more than expected. The ones we were able to stem were sweet and delicious. I would definitely recommend Fulton for all your oyster needs!!!"

The packaging was excellent and the clams were in fine condition, no cracked shells.  I have eaten the clams raw, in white sauce and in red sauce.  The quality and freshness of the clams were outstanding.  I have one suggestion.  These clams are very fresh and they can be difficult to shuck even for a person who grew up in Queens.  If you watch the Fulton instructional video on shucking clams you will see what I mean.  After some experimentation I found that difficult clams can be relaxed by thirty to forty seconds in the microwave.  The result is a slightly warm  raw clam but all the delicious flavor is still there. Finally I want to thank Nicki Stagg of the customer service office for her outstanding support in answering my concerns.  I will be ordering more items from Fulton Fish Market in the future"

No fishy smell like you get when you buy it elsewhere, no fishy taste. I've told friends and family that this is where they should buy their fish. If you want great, fresh tasting fish, Fulton Fish Market is the place."
