Not sure what's going on in shipping dept.update: I reached out again and they sent me a third wrong item. When I reached out after than they advised me that the item I wanted was sold out. I found a device that works for me elsewhere. I'm taking it as a sign that it wasn't meant to be."

The one with the suction cup was much more stableI however I really did not like the suction cup melting on my dash.  It  was very difficult to clean off the dash.I guess I will use the CD phone mount until wizgear comes out with a better dash mount phone holder."
