          "Contenu": "I'm a 20-year marketing veteran who decided to use this for a client's project. I have audio, a phone system, and a few other things recorded... I log in today to add to the project and saw that the VOICE I was using is depreciated. Um... what if I have to make a change in the future to the hours?? What if I need to tweak something??? Figuring that the company could load the voice into my account, I opened a ticket. Nope! Pick another voice they told me. They basically said to screw off and there is nothing they will do. So if you use one of their voices, remember it can be depreciated at any time, and then you're screwed if you need to edit a project. Good Technology - Bad Leadership and customer service. Find a better provider is my suggestion."

As someone who reached out multiple times with a variety of inquiries, I found the customer service severely lacking. My messages were met with delayed and often ambiguous responses that made it difficult to move forward.It\u2019s particularly frustrating because the potential for a meaningful collaboration is clearly there, given the company\u2019s technological capabilities. My team and I were looking for a tailored solution that would fit our specific needs, and we were even willing to invest both time and resources into making it work. Yet, despite our active attempts to seek help and clarification, our offers were met with silence.Moreover, I can\u2019t shake off the feeling that there seems to be some level of language or regional segregation, which feels counterproductive and unfair. One would expect a company in this field to be more inclusive and supportive in helping various nations with technological advancements, yet this has not been our experience.In conclusion, while ElevenLabs might offer a competitive product, their customer service and approach towards global inclusivity leave a lot to be desired."

          "Contenu": "I love the product, only reason for low stars is because of your billing policy.   Because VO timing is too fast and sounds unnatural, there is a lot of trial and error to get the VO to sound right.  I'm charged for pour quality output and every do-over attempt I have to do to get the VO to sound right.  I believe we should only be charged for word count that we actually export as a final product.******* additional response***** Thank you for your feedback on using \"projects\".  I tried it and it was not intuitively obvious. I couldn't figure out how to find and export the render. I'm a member of a large group of users that have signed up with your service, on the order of there are hundreds of us creating content on YouTube and we are migrating to your platform.  Someone in the group just mentioned that we should all petition ElevenLabs that we would like a way to do the voice synthesis without getting charged for do-overs.  Then another person dropped the name of a competitive platform that only charges for the word count of final product that is downloaded, so revisions due to quality issues from the original output are not charged.  I would like to request the ability to use the voice synthesis solution, not just projects, to experiment without being charged word count.  We all have 100,000+ final word count for our YouTube channels, but we are using far more than that due to quality issues.  The AI VO \"breaks\" if the content is too long, we don't get the right number of dashes.  Maybe the inflection of the voice has \"upspeak\" instead of going down at the end, or shadow sounds are added due to the dashes added to get natural pauses. We have all been discussing work around, like entering shorter text, closing the browser and re-opening it to refresh the AI VO after it \"breaks\", etc... Experimenting with the voice settings costs word count as well.  I see some in the group already leaving the platform to Wellsaid labs. I think this one change in your platform would be invaluable to you and your user base so they don't start looking for other solutions as they are saying it doesn't feel fair to be charged for errors created by the platform.  We don't mind having to do the work multiple times to get it right, we just mind getting charged for the errors that are out of our control.  I hope this is helpful.  Again, I love your platform and intend to stay.  I figured you would appreciate this \"focus group\" feedback from the honest and unfiltered chatter from a large group of your new customers that just flocked to your platform."

Two sentences that sounded like they were spoken back to back.3) It took 14 attempts to generate an audio file that sounded \u201csimilar\u201d to the test file.Since so so many of the generated audio files are unusable, users should only be charged if they download the audio files. Users should be allowed to discard bad files and not be charged.

I'm mute so having an opportunity to use a voice that doesn't sound robotic is wonderful, and I'm really glad I'm able to afford the characters that I manage to use every month. The only thing that I wish was better would be a way to just buy characters. I know you can with a quota, once you get to the creator tier, but I wish there was an option just focused on getting a lot of characters even if by being limited to only one cloned voice or something similar so that I would have the ability to talk a bit more during a month with the budget that I have (which rougly amounts to something between 30$ and 50$ monthly)"

However, when you have a subscription, you can still only use a small amount.

Its possible the subscription of 300$ wouldnt even be enough for just a small project. I hope ElevenLabs will change this!----Reply to your answer:Would you like to send me an email about this new plan please? I would like to try it and hope this would be the solution to the problem. Thank youEDIT: Besides the errors, the platform is still a reccomendation. There are multiple languages and I hope they will just improve it, thats why I changed my stars.

          "Contenu": "I have been using ElevenLabs since March of 2023, and I have a couple of serious questions for you.1.\t My client wants to convert another of his novels (90,000 + words) to audio using ElevenLabs. That novel, which used about 30 voices, needs to use about 6 of the same voice since they are central figures in the series. The new novel is presently undergoing the usual rounds of content and syntax editing, so it won\u2019t be ready for at least 3-5 months.Is there a way I can temporarily put my subscription ($99/month) on hold and still retain access to those same voices? Or, should I transfer my ElevenLabs subscription to the author and put the monthly fee under his name with his credit card attached? If he opens up his own account, how can he acquire access to the voices currently under my account? 2.\t I am trying to wrap my head around the purpose of Projects to see if it offers some advantages in my next TTS conversion. Both my client and I are looking for some way to increase efficiency while maintaining quality and flexibility. A.   Does using Projects increase rendering efficiency, and if so, how?B.\tOn the surface, it appears that Projects was designed as a textual editing program intended to eliminate the standard post- waveform editing process. Is this basically correct?C.\tHas Projects eliminated the 500-800 word input limitation for achieving consistent quality during conversion?D.\tIn my uneducated mind, it seems that Projects was created to better interface with other forms of LLM/ChatGPT/AI programs such as Whisper, rather than act as a standalone TTS entity. In this new form, and again this is my uninformed mind speaking, Projects acts as a coded UI wrapper, surrounded with Python/Java code, that includes the actual conversion engine but has no real effect on the rendered results per se. Is that correct?E.\tI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve guessed the workflow sequencing correctly, but it seems that one enters the text per voice into \u201cholding segments,\u201dand once these segments are deemed to be correct, the entire program is converted in mass into .mp3 or .wav, with all segments tied together in chapter form or as a completed entity. Is that even close to correct?F.\tMy experience has shown that changes are required for marketing purposes and editorial comments even after the entire book has been rendered. So how are revisions accomplished in the Projects format? Can one add/delete small pieces of the total without redoing the entire Project?Thank you for your help."

Voice cloning option available at Eleven Labs would cost you at least a thousand bucks with Synthesia. At Eleven Labs you get it for a minimum subscription. How great is that?! Those who were bothered to find out would know that Eleven Labs completes outsourced jobs for the service providers like Rask.ai and its achievements are available for much less than you would pay with Synthesia, Rask.ai and others. The conclusion is that yes, they are not perfect and there are flaws, which I am sure Eleven Labs is aware of (like lack of preview function or custom-spelling option or variety of languages). I do not think they will fix any of these flaws because this is not their main source of income but rather a testing platform - a charity project for activists and hobbyists. And for those who complains about inconsistency of speech results - have you seen 3 bars with a scroller to drag? Well, then check it out! The instruction for fine-tuning using these tools to produce more predictable results are available."

I love how lifelike it is and how easy it is to use it. There's nobody even close. So good! The API is straightforward and easy to drop in and integrate with any pipeline. The Discord is full of helpful people. The only thing I don't like about them is the price, lol. But in this case, you really get what you pay for, so I can't complain that much. Other than that, it's amazing."

It performs exactly as advertised and has become an integral part of my daily routine. The functionality it offers is robust and the output is consistently reliable, which is why I find myself returning to use it time and again.However, there's one aspect that could significantly enhance the user experience - the addition of a preview feature. It's essential to have a clear understanding of the adjustments made within the settings, especially before finalizing any changes. Currently, it's a bit of a guessing game which sometimes necessitates multiple paid editions to achieve the desired outcome. A preview feature would alleviate this issue, allowing users to see the impact of their settings adjustments before committing to them. This would not only save time but also the additional expense of multiple editions.Despite this, I wholeheartedly recommend Eleven Labs for anyone in need of a reliable solution in this domain. The product is solid, and with a few tweaks, it could be exemplary."
