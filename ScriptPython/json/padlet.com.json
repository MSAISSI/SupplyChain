At the beginning it was alright but i later realized that when you go onto another devise you can't edit posts you made on the last devise this mean i have multiple of the same thing with only slightly different things on them. Now that Ive been looking online for reason for this i realised that it is because i havent been able to login when working on it. I have tried to work out a way to fix this and i can't."

          "Contenu": "Padlet for personal, at that price, makes sense. Padlet for small organization, as long as you have below 50 members, for most uses, also makes sense.Think of padlet as a whiteboard, and you can have many whiteboards. Each whiteboard though, can have some limitations, such as who can post on it, and who can comment on it. Each padlet can be linked to another padlet, but it doesn't necessarily have to be so. In fact in many cases it is probably better to keep everything in one padlet, as long as you design a padlet properly with the correct permissions for interactions. Even the way the settings is done makes sense.  The learning curve isn't bad. You just have to pay attention to the basics, and then all of a sudden it'll start making sense once you start having people interact with your padlet and you learn \"oh this works, and oh this is not how I probably want it to work\". In my case it took me 2 padlets with interactions (with my students) to figure out what design I want, how I want to set the permissions, etc. The pricing for platinum (at least for me) makes sense. I think its even cheaper now, and its also feature richer than the last time I remember it to be (years ago). So its not a static product, and it has evolved to be a better product.  What made me continue to subscribe is the constant update and the continual support by the after-sales service which helped me to choose the correct plan (and the cheapest also, which suit my needs)."
