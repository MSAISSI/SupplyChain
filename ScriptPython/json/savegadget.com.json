After arrival, they emailed me several times asking for the \"old password\" I'm not sure why this is needed as the device was wiped. After giving all my old passwords, they still claimed they couldn't format it, but somehow offered me half as much. Because it was taking too much time I accepted the lower offer. Not sure what they could do with the phone if they truly couldn't get access."

First thing that needs improvement is the fact people are sending in devices worth a lot of money, yet can't see updates on where their package is?? Seems so outdated to me considering it's 2023 and every other buyback site allows for updates on where your package is, yet on here I had no clue if it was ever scanned at the post office. Second things that needs improvement is the fact there was absolutely no way to accept or decline the updated offer, leaving me to believe they just hope people won't respond and by default except the much lower price. They also are very dishonest and it proves it when I got a quote for Samsung Galaxy 23 128 GB at $401, but sent them a Samsung Galaxy s23+ 256 GB, which they pay $551 for. After the review they said it was financed so only offering me $168, but failed to mention the $150 increase because it was a better phone. It's unfair to take advantage of people and even worse to make them jump through hoops to receive they are deserved. I am hoping it doesn't take forever for a response from customer service as I need this money for my son's wedding in September."

It took more than a week - after numerous emails to get a response. Opted for PayPal payment but was charged a fee by PayPal. I suspect that SaveGadget put it as an immediate payment that resulted in the charge. If not they should explicitly state that you will not get the agreed upon price as PayPal will deduct a fee. If SaveGadget is charging the fee for using PayPal, then the payment should be increased to reflect the agreed upon price."

          "Contenu": "I recently completed an iPhone trade-in with SaveGadget. While they made a competitive offer which they honored without complications, and had a quick turnaround time, I wasn't very impressed with their customer service. They claim to provide a \"free pre-paid shipping label\" for trade-ins, but their label ended up being unusable for my particular case. They provided me with a USPS First Class shipping label. For those unfamiliar with USPS shipping regulations, USPS does not permit shipment of cell phones with a lithium battery via a First Class label. Unfortunately, I found this one out the hard way and the label was refused at the counter. I was forced to pay $10.50 for my own Retail Ground label, since walking away wasn't exactly an option when I also needed to pay for and pack a box on-site. I immediately documented the issue in a support e-mail to them after sending the package out and requested reimbursement for the corrected label. SaveGadget didn't bother to get back to me until after they processed the trade-in, refused to reimburse me, and ghosted me when I explained they made an error with their shipping label and was denied a good faith attempt to use it. It didn't seem very fair to me that I have to bear the cost of their mistake. I can't help but feel misled and swindled, and assuming they won't make this right, will likely avoid trading with them again. It's disappointing that an otherwise decent experience was tarnished by an unreasonable insistence on policy."

You know, since they\u2019re such a reputable company (worst ever I\u2019m now realizing). But I did my research and decided to tell Xfinity they can shove it. Just as SaveGadget explained how it worked was exactly my experience and I received nearly $400 for the phone. Never trade your phone anywhere else except with SaveGadget."
