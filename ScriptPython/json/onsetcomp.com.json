Why the hell does your system cost so much and tell me so little?  Why can't you make it simpler to use?   Is the average number of degree days that tough to decipher and tell me in a simple graph on my iPhone?   Good luck...you all are going to need it"

The InTemp you need an app to log in and manage and is not manageable by the desktop version.  In order to download the temperatures you need to be in that particular building, within range of the InTemp and then proceed to download.  Again, this can not be managed by the desktop version.  Highly suggest that you not purchase this."

As an alternative, they could be sent to Punta Arenas.Looking forward to your response!P.S.I hope to give you 5* once I get to use your devices."

Wouldnt connect to the wifi network, spent hours trying to prove that the modem on site is working on 2.4ghz and 5ghz. The RX3000 will only connect to 2.4g. And you have to enter the SSID manually.Long and short of it is we had to install a GSM modem.Even then it drops constantly. We installed a $40 Watchman to prove that the connection is there.One of the sensors had an error and removed itself. Added it back and now it runs half the temp of the other sensors. The logging has unexplained down peaks and gaps in the graphs.All in all it is really poor for $5000. Onset are very reluctant to replace anything faulty.Update: That is inacurate from Gregg. The unit was never hit by an elevator. Fake news! :)"

They said I needed a new current sensor.  For which, they sold me the wrong one. When I found out it wouldn't work with my data-logger, they sold me the right one.  In the meantime they decided that the first one wasn't broken (after I had purchased two needlessly and taken up valuable time), and that the first current sensor only needed to be re-programmed.  This was also not done during the repair.  In helping me re-program it, they suggested adjusting the scale: \"turn that screw counter clockwise till it stops.\"  me: \"It's not stopping, it just keeps turning.\"  Assistant: \"Wait, there's a warning about that, only turn it three times.\"  So now it's permanently out of scale but it records something.  I get to fix the scale factor myself in excel after collecting the data. I even got to pay for the shipping of the needless components.  It has been an incredible experience."

I mailed the loggers as soon as I had the service number, and shipped them overnight so they reached Onset in a very timely manner. When asking Onset for updates on the order (after they had them for over a month), it was difficult to reach them or hear back. Once they shipped the loggers, one of them was sent back without the cap protecting the optical sensor. A replacement was quickly dispatched, but this was still inconvenient for us."

I was ordering from Europe. The shipping cost from the US was very high, so I hoped to look into shipping options from Europe. Through chat I was connected with Ines Westra, the rep serving Europe. The level of response and thoroughness of reply quickly declined when I asked about other shipping options. In the end, I took things into my own hands and spent a lot of time to get quotes through European distributers, redirect shipping and ordered online. I left shipping instructions in the note section of the order to address shipping to another person's name and definitely do not include my name to avoid losing the package. Despite that, labelling and billing mistakes were made, shipping was addressed to my name, billing was addressed to the shipment receiver, address was wrong. I called twice and emailed to rectify this mistake. The agents who replied to the shipping labelling mistake varied from showing no willingness to help to being very helpful and apologetic. In the end my name was still on the package, and the billing address was still wrong."

          "Contenu": "This review pertains strictly to the purchase process and subsequent return process for the product purchased, but does NOT address the actual product. The purchase process was simple and efficient. I placed an order via the internet for 11 data loggers and they arrived within 7-10 days. Had I not had issues with the product which in turn led to a prolonged, frustrating return process, the rating would be 5-stars, but alas, this was not the case. Immediately upon receiving and testing the data loggers, the data indicated several of them were inaccurate. At that point, I initiated what I thought would be a simple return process...I was wrong. After speaking with several reps (both customer service and tech. service), I was essentially \"too bad\" b/c I had \"used\" the loggers. How would I know they were bad if I didn't use them? Eventually, I was able to come to an agreement with the Tech. Support Manager to send the loggers back so they could perform an internal evaluation. It took over 2-months for the evaluation (after being promised turn-around would be abt 1-week). Finally, they agreed there were issues with several of the units and agreed to issue a full refund. I'm certain I never would have received a refund had I not been overly diligent throughout the process. Ultimately, what initially seemed like a positive experience turned into a negative one. I won't be purchasing from Onset again."

I have used HOBO temperature monitors in the past without a problem, but I received a shipment of them last year that did not work. The shuttle did not communicate with the loggers. When I contacted tech support they said change out the batteries in the loggers, but they still did not work. Then they closed the support ticket despite my request despite telling them that the loggers were not working and that they should not do so. I had to put aside those monitors to do other projects and when I finally got back to them tech support has told me the warranty has expired and they will not replace them despite their never having worked. Today I've been sitting in my office since 7 am, leaving messages for tech support that has not shown up for a scheduled call. I think there must be problems at Onset now. This was not my experience with them in the past."

I returned to their site, ordered the cord and they did ship much more quickly than the several months I had awaited the device itself, but I feel this issue was a sad oversight.

My last order (water level logger mx2001), however, came without a cable which would normally render the product useless.  However, since I was replacing an older unit, I was able to reuse the old cable.  Another unit also has a glitch with the battery readings, alternating between 0 and 100 percent, immediately after new batteries were installed.  These units seem to go bad after 2 yrs. I do like the bluetooth connectivity and data appear reasonably accurate."

I ordered a depth sensor with the base kit which came with a set of various couplers. Because we already ordered the base kit I also ordered a water temp sensor (Hobo V2) to use with the base kit that was ordered with my depth sensor. I asked an agent whether or not I needed a coupler even though I already ordered the base kit which seemed to come with a set of couplers. I was advised to purchase an extra coupler for the water temp sensor, which I found out was not necessary so now I have two couplers and the hassle to return would not be worth it. Additionally, when I looked at the base kit I found a hair trapped in the sensors housing which I cannot open to remove. I feel like a quick quality check before sending out the equipment could have prevented this. I am unsure how the sensors will perform just yet. We've just deployed them and will be retrieving the data soon, hopefully, there are no issues there."

          "Contenu": "a)\tInexpensive, Easy to Set Up Wireless Sensor Network: Seems great, but the wireless sensors are of poor quality and often fail. In my mind it would make logical sense to make soil moisture and rain gauge sensors water proof, but I have noticed moisture intrusion multiple times. Also, the data being recorded with the soil moisture probes is highly variable and the rain gauge\u2019s plastic construction seems flimsy and does not help protect against needles and other debris.b)\tCloud Data Storage with an API: I really liked this idea, but both the API and online data download interface are clunky. The API has super low limits when it comes to how much data it can pull (1-day at a time basically) and has virtually no support. The Hobolink webpage offers exports but is also limited in the number of records it can export. If a sensor is ever unplugged and replugged it shows up as a new data export column and needs to be manually reselected during export. Also, I noticed some truncation issues with significant figures in exports especially in regards to rain gauge data.I am showing 6 that have permanently gone offline for one reason or another since February 2020 (out of ~35) - its Sept 2020 now. I believe all of them have failed for different reasons. We had one that wouldn't hold a charge for more than a week, one that was reading the same soil moisture reading regardless of soil moisture, one that was unable to connect to the logger out of the box, one that had a faulty seal and let moisture in, one that lost its connection and never recovered, and I believe the 6th was a similar connection issue. This list of 6 doesn't include ones that we have been able to fix through resetting or reconnecting.  My biggest complaint, however, would be long wait times on hold with customer service, emails that have gone ignored, and promises to get back with me that have gone unfulfilled, the biggest example would be the sensor that we got in yesterday was from a case I opened at the beginning of August.  When I have be able to talk with someone, they are always helpful and willing to send replacements under warranty but getting a voice on the other end of the line, or an email response is often difficult."

But the fact is that I should not have had to call in, since what he told me should have been in the manuals, perhaps in boldface.1 - You must push down really hard on the little dot to turn the unit on. I pushed firmly, but it's an instrument, and I didn't realize I needed to push far harder than for any normal switch. Dave explained it's to prevent accidental on/off action, which is fine, but there should be a note in the manual and the \"quick start.\" 2 - I had the two devices next to each other and to the iPhone on my desk. Only one would connect. Dave had me move them apart, saying the Bluetooth streams could interfere with each other. Problem solved. This should be in the manual and the \"Quick Start\" as well.  I look forward to many happy days of data logging. -Richard Leigh"

I paid for the \"better\" version of the software. The software is so-so. The plotting capability reminds me of 1997. It is a bit clunky but I plodded my way through it. In the end I just got it to a point where I could export a decent CSV format and did all of the real analysis and data munging with Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, NumPy, and SpiPy. These devices, and there is a great family of hardware, coupled with a good export routine linked to a Python back end (Jupyter, Pandas, NumPy & SciPy) provide a very powerful framework. The only reason I deducted 1 star was because the software is clunky and long in the tooth. Really nice hardware."

I ended up going to Home Depot to get a pole to set all of the equipment on.  Also, I felt like I had to dig to get the overall setup instructions.  Each item came with directions, but as a whole I needed to know how to get it to come together.  I called customer support and they were very helpful in pointing me to the white papers that describe in greater detail what needs to be done.  Also there was not a user manual included.  this also was found under the resources tab on the website.  I am currently trying to configure the dashboard to my liking, which is not as easy as expected.  Perhaps a standard dashboard should be presented and edits allowed???

          "Contenu": "Onset HOBO data loggers have been fairly good and reliable.  We have had some problems with the design aspects of the U23 PRO V2 RH/Temp recorders.  Some of the problems have been addressed and fixed by ONSET and some have not.  The plastic lens would become clouded in the outdoor environment and thus we could not download the data.  In trying to remove the lens it would then just crumble.  ONSET developed an inexpensive plastic cap that protects the lens and that works great.  I don't know how any one would be able to purchase these as I don't find them in the catalog.  The RH end of the recorder is open to the environment and we always have holes in the membrane caused by insects or other animals.  This can not be good.  Some sort of protection needs to be added here.  The service kits are messed up:  The service kit for the battery included the replacement battery and orange O ring to hold the battery.  BUT the O ring that seals this end of the U23 is found in the service kit for the RH end of the recorder!  So one would have to buy the replacement RH sensor to get the O ring for the other end of the recorder.  Makes no sense.  Ordering instructions don't give sufficient info to sort all this out.Nov. 14 added note:  Also the service kit for the battery replacement needs to have the little silica gel packs added to it.  Instructions say that if they are pink they should be replaced (no real way to dry them in the field).  But there are none included in the package.  At a minimum the catalog should indicate that they are not present so that they could be purchased.  One would think these things would be tested before being placed in the catalog for sale....."

          "Contenu": "I would like to recognize Andrew Thompson for his continued excellent customer service. He has provided me a continued stream of excellent guidance and referrals to technical support that has enabled me to radically expand the range of field activities the NH Department of Environmental Services Instream Flow Program is able to perform, based almost entirely on Onset equipment. I consider Andrew MY GUY at Onset. This week, Andrew acted quickly to resolve an internal Onset credit issue that threatened to prevent NHDES from ordering more of Onset's fine environmental monitoring equipment. I really appreciate his timely attention to this issue."
