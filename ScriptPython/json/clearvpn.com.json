          "Contenu": "This is a disaster or maybe I am missing a huge \u201cHow-To?\u201d These \"shortcuts\" are horrible in that it's one or the other? I want full and complete protection all the time and know that when the ClearVPN is on (which is hard to know because my IP address was showing to the world, yet I \"was protected!\") I am fully protected AT ALL TIMES. To wit: my IP is ALWAYS masked; my DNS queries are encrypted and using one server not 11; my connection is blocking all trackers, ads, and malware; I want to change my location on the whim and not anything else all these other safety measures are always in effect. I am flabbergasted by this non-intuitive, poorly implemented VPN coming from MacPaw (yes, it's in beta so heed this critique, it is practical). What of the protocols: Stealth, WireGuard (UDP, TCP), OpenVPN (UDP, TCP), Smart, IKEv2? What about access/blocking LAN connections? How can I connect to the Fastest Connection while maintaining full security? Any outside reviewers on data storage? What happens when you receive a do not notify warrant? How about a walk-through video on how to use? a 7-day trial is not enough for a full review of ClearVPN and how it works/doesn't work. Make some changes, quickly. PS: There are numerous grammar and syntax errors on your site that need to be addressed post haste."

In the worst case, like today, we give up making it work on the devices we want to and accept the fact that we just spend 30 min of our lives trying to make a product we paid for work.In the best case, I start communicating with the support and after 3 days or so of emails back and forth, the app works. Till 2 days later, when I have to re-install it again. I like the company and their idea with nifty shortcuts, but am getting so frustrated with the product that feels so unstable across all my devices, that consirder asking for money back. Too bad!   Yet another day I decide to dedicate anothe 3 min to write the review."

          "Titre": "ClearVPN is not really a VPN",
          "Contenu": "ClearVPN is not really a VPN. A VPN encrypts your traffic and sends it through an intermediary server. Thus it hides your location, allows you to access content regardless of geographical location, and hides and protects your data - ALL AT ONCE. ClearVPN does NOT do all of this. It purposefully allows you to only choose one of these features at a time while connected. It does this by purposefully exposing your data depending on which option you have selected at the time. ALSO, when you select \"hide your location\" it doesn't actually hide your location. Just run any IPv6 IP Location test online and you will see that it does NOT hide your location. I set ClearVPN to rout my traffic through the US, but it doesn't work. Every IP address location test online shows my REAL location. Not only that, but ClearVPN automatically changes the server location so that you can't select a static location. It switches from USA to Africa to EU all by itself, thus changing your location while you're online. That completely defeats the purpose of the service. This \"VPN\" is not a true VPN, and should not be trusted under any circumstances.[update} In response to ClearPVN (below) all I have to say is that they know damn well that when you rout your traffic through someone else's servers (which is what a VPN does) it covers your IP address automatically. Thus there is no reason to force customers to choose either \"hide my location\" or \"brows securely and privately,\" or \"unlock streaming services.\" If you're routing your traffic through the USA, for example, you can already access USA Netflix. You don't have to have separate features. You're purposefully giving up people's personal data and you know it. Not only is your product totally worthless, but I've lost respect for MacPaw entirely. How could you please such a transparently dishonest, and worthless product?"

However, it loses connection from time to time and can be even more reliable. Another thing that needs to be improved on the MacOS version is to match the menu bar icon's colour with the other menu bar icons. Sometimes, when other icons are white to math the darker background, ClearVPN's menu bar icon is black and doesn't match. Overall, it's a blazing fast VPN."

I like being able to change the location of my IP address, that way if there is a local cyber criminal physically close to me they won't be able to access my approximate location.
