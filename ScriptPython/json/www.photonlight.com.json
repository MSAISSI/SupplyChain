They will badger you for a review until you start to think to yourself that you\u2019d be willing to pay double if they would simply LEAVE YOU ALONE!!!!They will annoy you to the point that you will consider throwing all 3 of the yet unused lights you purchased, into the trash because their constant aggressive email barrage, nagging you for a review is frustrating to the point that they make your stupid cheating lesbian ex wife seem calm and reasonable by comparison.  DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON PRODUCTS SOLD HERE UNLESS YOU ARE PREPARED TO GIVE THEM A REVIEW WITHOUT EVEN HAVING TRIED THEIR PRODUCT."

Well, that's where we stand. Still en - route, click on USPS and it still shows it to be in Oregon awaiting pickup. So who knows where its at. I do know this company was quick to collect my payment.But I will reserve leaving 4 stars until I receive the items. This excuse of no workforce is available due to covid, is getting old.That's when management picks up the ball, put the disc batteries into an envelope, print out a label and call Post Office for Pick up. Pretty simple.BTW, IS THIS THE SAME USPS THAT WANTS RATE INCREASES. I THINK WE SHOULD DEFUND THEM. MY PURCHASE IS SOMEWHERE IN THE ABIS."

But they turn off automatically after ten to fifteen seconds. That drives me bats when I am trying to use it as a work light or read a menu.

For such an incomplete package the value is just not there compared to so many other companies now selling micro lights.I also bought some replacement covers but $2 is a bit high for a disk of plastic compared to the black clips that sell for $1.25.The black clips come standard with the II Pro, but they should rather come standard on the covert models so the clip doesn't reflect light.I own 8 Micro Freedom from the past and my recent order was for a mix of 9 lights."

My expectation was that once the switch is activated by pressing, the light remains on until the switch is pressed again and the light goes off.\rMy previous key chain light had a switch to keep the light on continously."

The other cheaper ones, the switch did not work. Keeping the plate depressed to keep the light on, while hanging on to one's key chain, was ridiculous. Also, the cheaper ones either did not allow one to change the battery, or simply fell apart in a way which was not conducive to spending the time putting it together. (I have not tried changing the battery yet. So that test is forthcoming). Expensive, but maybe worth it. I have tried the tiny flashlight type key ring lights. But the twist to turn on - again a real pain when holding on to the keychain and the other hand is otherwise holding stuff."

The product I purchased just did not have the power to allow even the highest end surveillance cameras to see me or provide me with any usable light in the dark via surveillance cameras. I also liked the ability to clip or wear the light around my neck which this product included. In closing, I need a much more powerful infrared light emitter in order to meet my needs."

          "Contenu": "I've used PowerEx Batteries for about ten years, have a couple chargers, including a Wizard One  MH-C9000. All these purchases have been from Photon Light.The recent purchase, # 145123, was for a dozen AA's. According to your website, they are shipped fully charged. None of the batteries received had more than 20 mAh in them, half were between 8 and 13 mAh.I put them in the Wizard One, and charged them, without analyzing them. Five held less than the 2500 mAh minimum guaranteed capacity.Of the remaining, three were at/above the stated 2700 mAh capacity. The rest were between 2550 and 2622 mAh. Voltages of all were 1.41 to 1.45.The five under performers - the ones received with less than 2500 minimum mAh capacity - were put through one Break-in session, which brought their capacities up into the 2600's. The range was 2600 to 2631 available capacity. Voltages were 1.42, 1.42, 1.43, 1.43, 1.45.Like I wrote, my first purchase of these MaHa batteries from you was about ten years ago. Never before had an issue like this. IF I was a first time buyer, I would have returned these batteries to you for a refund, and never looked back. I'm concerned and disappointed, in part because I refer folks to you all the time.Because of my past good experience with your company, and this product, I decided to try to resolve the issue on my own, but I must say, I am disappointed. In the past, your batteries always started out with capacity beyond not just the minimum, but actually at or beyond the target capacity. Only three of the twelve batteries in this order met that expectation.Please look into this. Until I believe this quality control issue has been resolved, I can't continue to recommend others to you, and will be exploring other options - in case I feel the need to make a change."

          "Contenu": "My extended family (kids, grandkids, spouses, and my wife and I, have approximately 28-32 Photon X-light Micro units in service from Maine to Colorado. Our two great-grandkids will each receive two of them this Christmas. We have both clear and safety orange units. We tried other Photon models and don't like them. We are mostly very happy with these units. BUT: we use them heavily for all kinds of purposes, and we have discovered that no matter how precise and careful we are, by the time you change the battery five times, the clip that holds it together, breaks and the two halves can no longer be joined.  Also, the \"bridge\" on which the ring is mounted, also breaks easily. Photon claims the lights have a lifetime warranty, but methinks that if they get a lot of returns from our family members, they will find a loophole in this warranty.  So I have designed a cheap and effective work-around that uses narrow strips of super-reinforced tape, and short pieces of stainless wire, to overcome the materials and design flaws. A number of these units have been in service in backcounty, combat, and city areas for many years, and we use so many of them we have found a source of batteries that costs ~$8 for a pack of 20 cells.  I installed new cells in two units this morning, and that reminded me to write this review."

          "Contenu": "Customer Service and Shipping was Very Good! The product itself is Very Bright and appears Outwardly Sturdy! However, in saying that, my teenage son took the battery cover off and the copper wire that holds the batteries, had snapped off its posts! Internally, it appeared to be the weak link? I don't know if it was a solder failure (although I didn't see any evidence of solder?) or is this copper wire a one piece wire that just snapped off its posts?In any event, I rigged it up to work (Mcgyver style), but trying to snap the cap back on was an exercise in patience, let me tell you! I tried everything under the sun and then my son tried it again and success was attained!So those are my two beefs: a) faulty internals,and b) finicky battery cap! Maybe we got a Monday or a Friday built light? Other than those two issues, I would have rated it 5 Stars!"

I don't remember if their website said they had stock, but I know it didn't say out of stock like everywhere else. I decided to order from PhotoLight even though I had never ordered from them in the past. The next day, I had not received any tracking info, so I called them. A REAL PERSON answered the phone and told me that they were out of stock, but that they were expecting some in in the next few days. He apologized that the website didn't show out of stock when I ordered. The part was shipped within a couple of days,  I got plenty of tracking updates and had the part in hand a couple days after that.I never would have gotten to talk to a real person and get an estimation that they should have more in a couple of days from any of the sites I have ordered from before. I wasn't really out anything since it was sold out everywhere else. Overall, I truly appreciate the personal response to my inquiries about my purchase and I will shop PhotoLight first next time I need an Insteon product.Thanks a ton!Chris"
