I'm currently with only two exchanges due to limited funds but when possible I intend to run with more exchanges to get more signals.Right now in addition to the above I'm experimenting with paper trades on Smart trades and have had some good results. Another week and I'll go live with these too."

At the time I was missing Bitvavo as an exchange and several indicators that came along during the learning experience. I decided to trust the feedback from Altrady support that many more features would be added in a fast pace.Well, Altrady delivered! Soooo many new functions and features are added every day and support is always super fast and extremely helpful.Altrady makes the road to grow from a beginning trader to advanced user so much better."

Possibly the best customer support that I have ever received from a digital company.The product/trading terminal drastically improved my trading and my profits.  I use Coinbase Pro (GDAX) as my primary account and I find that interface to be nearly unusable and very difficult to work with.  The integration with between that and Altrady was quick and very straightforward.  This put all of the information that I could not find on CBPro right in front of me and it was very customizable.I highly recommend this software for both the product and the support."

After contacting support, I was asked to enter my email address. I entered my email address and Timothy with support answered in under 2 mins. He explained that the position was opened with conservative settings and showed me how to change from day trader to conservative settings with a screenshot. I was manually changing the chart from 1 hour to 2 hour for the day trader and conservative settings, which was not working. Being new to the Altrady platform, I did not understand I had to change the algorithm settings under base info. Support was fast and courteous. I also was using another bot platform at the time, and the signals from Altrady seem to be superior, and I was able to get out of trades faster. I am very happy with the bot, trading terminal, and the customer support. Keep it up, guys!"

De meeste zaken die ik gebruik zitten in het basis abonnement, Altrady is daarmee een uitgebreid en zeer prettige tool voor het Traden. Ik leer nog steeds bij en ben nog lang niet klaar met alle opties te leren ontdekken elke keer ontdek ik wel iets nieuws. Zo is er ook een scanner optioneel maar die ken ik nog niet. Naast de opties die er al inzitten zijn ze constant in ontwikkeling en wordt het steeds beter en uitgebreider, ook voor GridBot traders zijn er uitgebreide youtube filmpjes om je op weg te helpen. Het is een Nederlands product met een goede, snelle en kundige helpdesk in meerdere talen. Ook handig zijn de diverse social media kanalen zoals Discord  en Telegram. Waar het een en ander uitgelegd wordt door de ontwikkelaar en de team leden en waar je simpele vragen kunt stellen of anders wordt doorverwezen helpdesk chat via de website. Op social media kunnen gebruikers elkaar ook helpen, op Discord zelfs in meerde kanalen.Kortom een aanrader als je een stabiel, uitgebreid en prettige tool zoekt, voor zowel beginners en gevorderde traders die zelf- of geautomatiseerd trades willen plaatsen.Top for 'Crypto' Traders!Altrady is super user-friendly in my opinion, it has many options for trading with handy smart orders. Most of the things I use are in the basic subscription, making Altrady a comprehensive and very enjoyable tool for Trading. I am still learning and am far from finished discovering all the options every time I discover something new. For instance, there is also a scanner optional but I don't know it yet. Besides the options that are already in it, they are constantly developing and getting better and more extensive, also for GridBot traders there are extensive youtube videos to get you started. It is a Dutch product with a good, fast and knowledgeable helpdesk in several languages. Also handy are the various social media channels such as Discord and Telegram. Where things are explained by the developer and team members and where you can ask simple questions or else be referred to helpdesk chat via the website. On social media, users can also help each other, on Discord even in multiple channels.In short, highly recommended if you are looking for a stable, comprehensive and pleasant tool, for both beginners and advanced traders who want to place trades themselves or automatically."

And this platform is all in one, all inclusive, and everything a trader needs to trade, many tools, alerts, robot trading automation, alerts for each trade.I like that the team themselves are traders, which means they understand what they are doing. The working environment on this platform is comfortable, and I feel here as if I am in their team, and not just a user.Their robots, which trade without interruption and confidently. Even if some kind of problem sometimes appears, then robots like an all-terrain vehicle and an armored car continue to trade further, notifying the trader to pay attention to the settings. With all this, the robot does not stop, which is a great advantage. I repaired it and the tarpedo flew on. ))The guys are always in touch and have a very strong patience with all clients, explain on the fingers until the client understands or jointly find bugs and misunderstandings. The guys recognize the mistakes with dignity, as if you are working with a friend together (they do not make excuses and do not evade), but quickly correct them.They also listen to clients about innovations, as it will be convenient in the first place for the user.I would like to write a lot, but already enough. I recommend them 1000% and you will be safe and comfortable in trading as one friendly family of traders. )) I think with this approach they will achieve a lot, and I wish to achieve a lot in development. The only thing I don\u2019t understand is why he is not in the top, apparently they work for themselves and their clients, and marketing is secondary))). As of now, many have super marketing, but the product leaves much to be desired. I choose the first, this is the quality and reliability of the ALTRADY service. It's really a pleasure to work with them. This is the level of professionals."
