          "Contenu": "The provider is perfect for masochists who love to be insulted in the support chat. RDNS support did not work on the server control panel, which support was unable to fix within 5 days. After 5 days of downtime for our product, I received not an apology, but an offer to update the RDNS through the support chat instead of the panel. Okay, I agreed to this decision, but after asking to update the RDNS in the chat, I received from a company employee a portion of insults and accusations that I was a scammer/spammer and their services were not for me, after which my server was canceled (thank you, at least the money was returned )I am very glad that your employees use RDNS extrasensory abilities to determine everything about the client, but I expected to get a regular working server and not insults and almost a week of project downtimeI'm surprised that anyone even works with you"

I was trying to install Linux onto the box, but the Control Panel is TERRIBLE. It has a automated installation for most operating systems, but if you choose Linux, the installer won't work due to RAID bs.  It does not matter what RAID level you set it as, it is still not going to install.I contacted Support about this issue, and they blamed it on that \"I\" messed up, when I did everything exactly as it should be done through the Control Panel.They also claim \"100% uptime\" in their SLA, which is not even LEGAL! You can not claim 100% uptime. The highest you can claim is 99.99%.And the worst part is, that you can not even GET A REFUND for the order.  The ONLY kind of a \"refund\" is to account credit, which is not even guaranteed that you'd get due to their ToS.This provider is complete bs to use.  You'd be better off using something like Hetzner, OVH, Server4You or even CONTABO!"

          "Contenu": "I'm in the process of scaling out my infrastructure to support the release of my product so I ordered an extra server in Chicago. The point of scaling out is to build up two Nomad clusters, one in Dallas and one in Atlanta for HA/redundancy.  Due to technical issues on your end in Chicago, the OS install kept getting stuck at 20%.  I opened a ticket and Damian replied and said there was an outage and they were working on it. Okay, I get it. The outage page he forwarded me said it should be back up within an hour.  An hour went by, two hours, three hours... the whole day.  I came back the next morning, still down and one 13 hour old notice apologizing for the delay. Remember, I'm needing these additional servers for fault tolerance.   Anxious to get my servers online so I can start testing, I looked into it more the night before and saw that there were two servers, slightly better than the one in Chicago so more expensive, and there was one available in each datacenter where my other two servers already were. So I purchased those and started the OS installs and replied to the ticket to ask for a refund for the Chicago server I was never able to access.  The next morning, I came back to find that one of them had booted up and was ready but the other one hadn't so I tried restarting it a few times and navigating through the site trying to figure out how to access it another way. Nothing worked. Same as the one in Chicago only this time it would get stuck at 60%.  I got a reply to my ticket later saying it was against the TOS to refund but I could get a credit.  Okay?  I mean, I was never even able to log into it because of the outage on your end but thanks for not making me pay for something you never gave me? Whatever, no big deal.  I was polite and said thank you and explained the other issue with the server in Dallas.Damian replies later and says \"some have raid cards\" or something to that effect implying that they were configured differently.  This is another red flag.  I don't want to have to deal with different server configurations in my CM tools and end up with a bunch of frankenservers and one-offs.  I'm definitely not starting out that way.  So I asked if it could be moved to a different box so they were the same and he said there were none left as \"it shows on the front page\".  At this point, I'm not only frustrated with the lack of progress I've made in the last two days and disappointed that my first attempt at scaling out my solid well organized fault tolerant plan that's been in the works for the last two years is off to such a rocky start, now I'm dealing with one of your support tech's attitude as well.So I decided to cancel the two servers, one of which again, I was never able to log in to, and made sure they were cancelled immediately to free them up for someone else and politely asked for credit for them. Damian comes back and gives me the \"okay but this is the last time\" speech.Just so we're clear.  I didn't just waste the last two days trying to restart OS installs and suddenly change my mind because I thought it would be fun.  I backed out of those purchasing those servers from you out of lack of trust and satisfaction with your services. I wasn't even able to access them.Now Damian seems to think this was all somehow my fault and I need to be taught a lesson and be careful about the rules of the TOS in the future.  And I'm considering whether or not I want to continue doing business with you at all."

Not very helpful on urgent situation when you're abroad or on the road with different time zone. Their security is also lacking as there is no firewall for port blocking at the router level. The price may be competitive but you get what you pay for if you don't mind with the challenges of tackling on your own and facing security issues."

The support limited itself to saying that we applied our contingency plan and that they depended on fire department to reactivate the service. Everything unpresentable, of the greatest irresponsibility. They sent a technical report of what happened a week later and with a mediocre explanation. It shows that they are not interested in good service but only charging. I am very dissatisfied with this service and we feel highly insecure with the system. A few days ago we tried to request a new server to migrate the current one and update, but it was not possible either because they do not have the machines that are needed or do not understand the requirement or are not interested in doing so."

We came across US Dedicated randomly when looking to source a single server in Chicago.  These guys surprised us, no downtime. The website was sleek, they put a ton of effort into automation as well as building their control panel and infrastructure out.  This is not easy to do by any means.  The network itself was very quick and stable, perhaps they were an INAP customer.  There are not many small hosts like this left anymore.   Have to give them credit.  We ended our contract because we no longer needed the server.  The only downside is that they do not seem to like to communicate too much, which is a mistake because had they engaged our sales requests more at the time we could have possibly sent them 2 cabinets of data center colo equipment.  Since they were unresponsive we opened a few cabinets presence in Quadranet LA."

One aspect that really stood out for us was the hassle-free migration from one data center to another, without any downtime on the network side, and the ability to move the same IP subnets. This was a huge benefit for us, and we appreciate the seamless transition that Dedicated.com provided. (we did it one more time to increase the power capacity)Of course, none of this would have been possible without the knowledge and dedication of the team at Dedicated.com. In particular, Matt's experience and dedication have been invaluable in helping us improve our setup. His immaculate attention to detail and willingness to go above and beyond has been a true asset to our business.Overall, we highly recommend Dedicated.com to anyone looking for a reliable and supportive provider. Their commitment to excellence and reliable services make them a top choice in the industry of colocation and hosting."

We went from a Managed Colo customer to a full Cabinet Colo customer in this time frame.I can't speak for their other services but as a colo customer, we've had zero network and zero power downtime since 2018. This to me is the definition of 100% uptime. Matt and his team know how to build reliable and proven network infrastructure and I can't speak any more highly of him. I will admit, our relationship, in the beginning, started off rocky due to some issues regarding how the company handles remote hands support. But, we decided to look past this incident and continue our relationship with Dedicated.com. I'm very glad we did. The data that we host in the data center is mission-critical to the success of our clients. If I can trust Matt to take care of our network needs, you can too.Matt and his team continue to improve the Dedicated.com network and so long as they keep their service top-notch, we will be a customer. You can't go wrong with Dedicated.com."

          "Contenu": "We've used US Dedicated for around 7 years now and I have to say they're second to none! Highly recommend them, you will not be disappointed. It\u2019s extremely rare in the industry to have such amazing people like them.They\u2019re one of, if not the, best server infrastructure companies that we\u2019ve found in the US and we always continue to use them rather than going direct with datacenters due to the unparalleled service and support they give to us.Our infrastructure with them currently consists of 8 colocation racks across 4 locations and their support and assistance with our equipment is something we\u2019ve never had before. We\u2019ve had zero power downtime in any of the cabs with them, we operate our own network in most locations however use theirs too and it\u2019s been an extremely good experience overall \u2013 no issues with ddos attacks either, their protection works well.Recently signed a new contract with them to move 2 cabs in New York from Coresite to their cage in INAP and had the COO of the company Matt helping us move and ensuring we had everything we needed (including grabbing us some lunch which was much appreciated)! When we setup our LA/CHI locations they sent someone out to help us too and when we got ourselves some cabs in Dallas, we had the pleasure of meeting quite a few of their team (including the main man himself, Robby) as during the time we moved in they had been migrating between two datacentres.What makes them superb is the fact that during times of peak demand they offer dedicated servers that we can purchase that are available instantly, which allows us to scale painlessly without ordering equipment, waiting around, etc.On occasion we have to contact their support for example when we are getting deliveries or we need a cross-connect done, remote hands, et la, the responses come quite fast and usually from Damian (who is one of the most knowledgeable support staff I\u2019ve ever had to deal with, absolute legend), they get our queries handled well. They have a phone number too, fast to answer and you get a human on the line that is US based!"
