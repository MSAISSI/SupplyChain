Bottom line I paid for two working motors and only received one working motor. I feel that they should have refunded  for the first motor."

The one they sent doesn't even match the price on there website for the item shipped but it did match the item I wanted. They offered to take it back with a 25% re-stocking fee and would mail out a check. Wouldn't trust that in a million years from this company. They also told me it was my fault for not calling them to make sure."

          "Contenu": "WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER BUY ELSEWHERE. I SPENT $2500 ON THIS FRIDGE TO HAVE IT ARRIVE BROKEN AND NOT BE REFUNDED ANYTHING.   The fridge itself is wonderful and I don't want this review to reflect on the Isotherm Fridge line, this review is strictly a complaint against MMarine and their handling of the fridge. I ordered this fridge three months ago and it arrived on a pallet.  I had to pay $500 for shipping.  The fridge is intended for my van which I live out of full time. I wasn't able to open the fridge for a few weeks since I was traveling but when I did open it I immediately saw that the fridge had been damaged during shipping. The heat sync had been smashed in, the fan was broken and refrigerant could be heard leaking from the fridge. I took pictures of the damage and submitted these to MMarine.  I also submitted pictures of the damaged box from before I opened the fridge (in these pictures there was things resting on top of the box and MMarine argued that that was what caused the damage even though if you look at the damage pictures attached it would take a dropped shipment to smash the heat sync the way that it was).  All of this was not enough to get the shipping insurance that I paid for.  They then would only offer me a 75% refund after I paid to ship it back (so I would be down $1000 from the $500 shipping cost and 25% refund loss).   I told them that I did plan to send it back but that I was on the road and wouldn't be able to do so for some weeks and when I did go to return it later when I made it back to my storage unit they said it was no longer an option.  Overall this company has no understanding for the lifestyle of people living out of vans or boats which is their entire audience that they are selling to. I SPENT 2500 ON A FRIDGE THAT ARRIVED BROKEN AND GOT NO REFUND.   I now have to figure out repairing this fridge myself so I'm not down all of this money.  DONT SUPPORT THIS COMPANY AND AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE TAKE YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE."

The 4 stars is only given due to the delivery company, which took multiple days to finally deliver my product. I waited at my house three separate days from 9-3 as directed and still received my purchase at 3:45 on the third day\u2019s attempt. When the truck arrived, the delivery person would not drive the truck to my house (staying at the top of a hill about 50 feet away) and wouldn\u2019t even drop down the truck\u2019s lift, which I needed as I had to carry a fridge out of a large truck. I do not blame Mmarine for this terrible service, although for their sake I do hope they choose a better delivery company in the future as it hurts their business. Looking forward to finally having my new fridge."

Their service agent was very helpful and informed me that the refrigerator was in stock and could be shipped out in a couple of days. We made the transaction and in a few days I received an email with pictures of my fridge all packaged up wrapped in plastic on a pallet secured down with banding and sticker stating \u201cfragile this side up\u201d on several locations on the box. The pallet arrived in the same shape that the pictures showed, no damage and still secured to the pallet. I have never received this kind of high end customer service that I have from MMarine. Kudos to them on their quality products and customer service. They will receive future business for me and I highly recommend them do you."
