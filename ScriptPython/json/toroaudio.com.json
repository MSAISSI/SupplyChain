I thought this product was going to come from toro and it came from Amazon. If I knew that I would of ordered prime instead. Reason I didn't in the first place because I am a basshead that believes in supporting the audio companies and not just looking for the cheapest way possible. And I almost garuntee that the packaging will not be up to audio standards. Amazon usually throws stuff in the nearest size box and calls it good. Where audio companies make the boxes fit the product.Plus as it sits right now today I do not have my product yet. I know covid is hurting companies and I hope things go back to normal or close to it. Nothing against toro I can't wait till I get to hear the product."

So in turn I decided to treat myself by buying 4, 10 fierce and a r5 amp to go with the r5 I all ready have. I can't wait to have an installed and see people's reaction.

However I have to upgrade my alternator and wiring due to the amount of current the r5 draws, which only means its going to take even longer for me to save for a pair of the force 12s. Lol but seriously I would recommend toro to anyone looking for great audio on a budget. Totally worth the money and fast delivery."

Learned real quick this amp was the real deal and could easily push that speaker to it's max with very little trouble. Even wired it in series to 4ohm as I feared to blow the speaker. Decided to upgrade to a Toro Force 12s and just wow. Speaker is still being broke in but only expect greater gains once I give it a few weeks to really start to push it. The difference between Kicker and Toro is night and day. You guys have another Toro customer for life."

The way they play and sound and they look, especially for the price you have it for right now, is basically a steel.Unbelievable price.They perform with the best of them up there, and give all these top brands speakers a run for their money. That's why I purchase the subs before the original price kicks in,and you know what,they are still well worth it. I might even buy four more Fierce 8 in subwoofers if my wife lets me. For anyone thinking about buying these speakers don't wait too long they won't last at this price and they'll be sold out soon enough.they are better than 5 stars,more like 10 stars"

As a matter of fact, I was bumpin down the road and a guy Next to me and me all over so he could check out the system and then offered to purchase it, said he had never heard of them and now a big Toro fan after I sold him that set up. And of course after I sold them I just had to upgrade my Toro\u2019s and went with a pair of Fierce 12s\u2019s. Have em hooked up now in a generic box that is crap, AND THEY STILL SOUND AMAZING!! I am in the process of designing a tuned box to fit my 2014 Jeep JKU and I can\u2019t wait to finish it cuz I\u2019m ready to really rattle some brains!! haha    The leap of faith paid off for me! Toro\u2019s build quality speaks for itself, I could go on and on about it but once you actually hear the quality!!! Your brain is boggled by the insane thumps and responsiveness of em!!
