          "Contenu": "Having purchased a Rangemaster Classic 110 gas cooker and hood it arrived damaged. When contacting Rangemaster they pass you onto a company called Repair care to deal with the repairs. They then book you and engineer that doesn't turn up as they have subbed the original job to another company called Domex. When contacting Domex they explained that they have no engineers available to carry out the repair on the arranged date. So basically Rangemaster take your money and then don't give a dam about the product they send out along with their non existent customer care service. The customer then has to scrabble about trying to find out who is responsible for carrying out  repairs to the damaged goods on behalf of Rangemaster. This company provides expensive cookers and hoods and no back up service. Be warned do not buy an Aga Rangemaster product if your hoping for reliable customer service."

He left our property having left the fault unresolved and we have had no feedback from him or rangemaster since!We are now left without a hob for the Christmas period and family to host.These cookers are not fit for purpose and the customer care team are slow to reply and of little help. I would never again purchase one of these ranges."

Unless I provided every single bit of information (appliance age, purchase date etc etc, which I didn't have at the time) I couldn't get a simple advise on how to find it. I know Rangemaster like to repair their overly priced appliances themselves, but that doesn't mean they should try and cripple every 3rd party repair attempt."

We were then told by Rangemaster that delivery would be on 12 December.  Today we were told by Rangemaster that due to being let down by their supplier (of the gas ignition) we would not now get the cooker till some time in January. Bearing in mind that we specifically ordered the new cooker for Xmas as our current cooker isn't working and we have people coming, this came as a massive blow. It has been suggested that we could have the cooker in a different colour, then have the doors changed to the colour we actually ordered, at some later stage. Alternatively we could have a different model of cooker to the one we ordered. We are currently considering what to do. Very disappointed."

          "Contenu": "We have a Rangemaster cooker that is 20 years old and the gas jets on the hob needed attention.  The call out fee is \u00a3150 and we were told that the engineer probably would not have the parts so they order them and then thery charge a further \u00a3100 to come out again and fix it.  My husband had to pay the \u00a3150 in advance, and they said they would have to fix a date for the engineer and would get back to us. When he told me I said it was too expensive and wanted to look around so he phoned back 5 mins later - We were told there was a \u00a336 cancellation charge!  We then found out that Rangemaster use Stellisons engineers.  We phoned them direct and their fee is about \u00a399 plus parts and if they cannot fix and have to come back at a later date with the parts there is no additional fee. Rangemaster's potential \u00a3250 charge, plus parts is extrortionate and then charging a \u00a336 cancellation fee after a 5 minute call when no engineer had been booked is scandalous !!although the repairtech firm they use to book appointments were unwilling to refund us the \u00a336 Rangemaster have agreed to do so and will return the cancellation fee of \u00a336 in January - thanks"

          "Contenu": "Called them on Thursday 30th November 2023 as our range cooker gas ovens weren't igniting. They were quick to take a payment of \u00a3230 over the phone to book a service call with Repairtech Services. They told me to expect a call from the Repairtech engineer within two working days. Today, 5th December, by 4.30pm I'd had no call so called Rangemaster. Spoke to some bloke who sounded about 12 years old, told him the issue, he disappears for five minutes, only to come back and tell me that the local engineer hasn't been answering his phone or responding to emails for the past two days. I asked if there were any other engineers available to which he replies \"no\". All he could offer was to refund my money which according to him will take between five and seven working days. NOT GOOD ENOUGH RANGEMASTER!! I didn't spend two and a half thousand quid on a range cooker to receive appalling service like this. Would anyone from your end bothered to have called me seeing as your engineer has gone AWOL? I doubt it, I would have been left waiting for a call that was never going to come. I now have to find an engineer to come out before Christmas to fix the ovens and having called a few, no one can get to us before. Rangemaster, if this is how you treat your customers, then I will never buy anything from you again. Abysmal."

The warranty repair was hard to come by as it stated her 11 month old cooker was out of warranty when trying to organise a online warranty repair. Not to worry, after an hour on the phone and customer service online chat I managed to report the warranty repair to a customer service operator who thought it would be appropriate to send me a smiley face message when I was reporting my 86 year old mother does not have an oven to cook hot food with as its broken, again. The engineer came and did an initial inspection and advised the thermocoupler needed replacing and he would order one, three weeks later my mother still cannot cook hot food as they are having trouble sourcing one. I could get one next day delivery from Amazon though. She has now owned the cooker for a year and three days but has less than 11 months use due to the faults. It does not look good for when the warranty runs out if it breaks three times in the first year."

A cooker out of warranty but less than 3 years old. I am repairing this myself and found that the replacement parts so far costing \u00a3900, fail after a few months with no recourse. Their parts department has no telephone number. Ordered a part that their website says is in stock so I paid for next day delivery only to receive no confirmation email. You cant call as the only contact is via chat or email (because we all have time to write in chat boxes and send and wait for emails).  Finally get through on chat to be told the part isn't in stock, so I cancel the order only to be told it will take 7days to get a refund if the cancellation works. Next day get an email confirming the order and i will be notified once dispatched. I've already supposedly cancelled it, so have to send another email and wait, send another chat message and wait all the while my money is gone from my account. Worst customer experience from both a product and customer service perspective, for your sanity stay away and look to other products because once the warranty is gone on your 3.5k appliance you are on your own. Looking like a new cooker is required but it wont be a rangemaster or any of their sister companies. Next stop twitter."

However, after 3 years the spark ignition system failed on the hob top and 6 months ago the ovens failed to ignite even using a lighter. It has only been used by us for daily cooking and occasional family visits. Why should we pay repair costs or find money for a replacement? Not good for an AGA led brand and we're obviously not happy. We're in France now and it's impossible to find an engineer even though the exact same model is branded as Falcon."

Your timers appear to be made by Robert Shaw electrics Part A063730 assembled in Slovakia from Chinese parts. The Timer on my cheap microwave works fine still after 25 years. is it a sensible design to stop the main oven working (small one still works) when this poorly made component fails?"

Obviously a manufacturing / finishing fault. Couldn't use main oven for the 6 months we had it. They collected it today. I've ordered a Stoves instead. Such a shame. Rangemaster used to have a really good reputation and they're certainly not the cheapest on the market. Reading all other issues here, I would avoid the misery of buying a Rangemaster"

          "Contenu": "Update on previous review. Had second replacement delivered today and SAME FAULT. Flaking enamel inside oven and masking tape fixed to it. Delivery guys removed it along with enamel! So, all 3 cranberry ranges faulty. Called customer service and asked for refund and compensation as had it since September 2022 and never been able to use main oven. Also, as live in small cottage had to remove doors to accommodate delivery so a lot of hassle for nothing. So very disappointed as believed Rangemaster reliable appliances, but clearly this is a design fault. Where the enamel flakes off, there's a gap for steam to go into the main body via the oven. Very worrying. They assured me this had been inspected before coming out a third time. Clearly not the case. I would not recommend Rangemaster."

My stockist advised that a promotion pack to make my claim would be sent directly from Rangemaster which has failed to appear. Today I contacted them and have been  advised by Charley that firstly the claim form should have been with the delivery and then that the Elise 90 oven was not part of the promotion! (Which incidentally finished in April anyway!) It clearly states on my original invoice that a free set of saucepans IS included . I expected higher standards of customer service having purchased an oven fromRangemaster as opposed to other brands I considered at the time of purchase- lessons learned!"

I live in an area that has power outages quite often and trying to reset the clock has proved almost impossible.  It took an electrician who I called and paid at my own expense almost 45 minutes to reset the clock.  It is a complete nightmare and is totally unnecessary on a cooker of this price.  What is wrong with buttons to reset the time?  I would not have bought this cooker had I known in advance that something that could be simple is now annoyingly over-complicated. Digital is not always best.  Rangemaster should have a rethink about why consumers buy cookers and what they expect from them. Surely ease of use should be a priority?"

It's a very expensive piece of kit, but as someone that cooks regularly and is aware that gas is likely to be phased out... we went for it.  However, after just 3 1/2 years of use we now have an E6 error and the circuit boards on the hob must be replaced...at a whopping \u00a31200!!!  The warranty on Rangemaster is just 2 years... I can't help but wonder if this is why.  Given that the original unit cost around \u00a33000 this repair cost is an unwelcome shock.  We had anticipated at least 10 to 15 years of use from such a large investment.  So... lovely as it is, beware before you purchase.UPDATE:  it is the pans!!  Don't buy 'suitable for an induction hob' ones.  They frequently aren't! Check out page 3 on the user guide.  It is the only place they mention it but the pans must be completely flat, with absolutely no ridges etc.  Rangemaster have been very understanding about our frustration and incredibly helpful.  As have RepairTech.Excellent customer service from Charley at Rangemaster and Mark at RepairTech."

          "Titre": "Losing mastery over its range",
          "Contenu": "In March 2023 I got a 60cm Professional+ induction cooker. It is a formidable piece of equipment and very quickly became my pride and joy among the household appliances. I read the manual very carefully, changed all of my cookware to the recommended range and followed the daily maintenance instructions.And what's not to like in it? It looks great, it is very practical with its dials and double cavity and seems very efficient.Unfortunately, last week the induction hob broke when boiling water in a large base pan. I followed the troubleshooting section but had to resort to warranty. I have received a speedy response from Rangemaster, however it looks as if servicing has been outsourced and a visit from a technician got scheduled in 2w time. I personally feel that this is a very long time to wait for a visit which is effectively an inspection and does not guarantee working cooker. It is a long time to be deprived of a fairly essential appliance too. An automated message advised that if installation or use is at fault, I will be charged for the visit, which is fair enough, but given the length of time I will lose more than their fee for feeding the family on ready-made oven/microwave dishes by the time I have a working hob again and Rangemaster hasn't offered to reimburse me for this.At no point I received any communication from the servicing team to arrange the visit even though they advised Rangemaster they left me a voicemail. The third party does not seem to have their processes and message passing where it should be.I really hate to leave a low star review for it is a great piece of kit and I am sure formidable engineering went into it. Perhaps my frustration is proportional to how much I appreciated the appliance when it worked, but I feel that a company which is asking a considerable amount for its products and is asking you to buy premium priced cookware to secure item longevity could do better when servicing issues with their products."

          "Contenu": "I bought a Rangemaster Hi-Lite in late 2016 for nearly \u00a32000 and its display has now failed after only 6 years.I contacted their repair organisation and was told that there was no engineer, who was qualified on induction cookers serving my postcode. They offered to send me the part (\u00a3125 for a 4 digit display) for me to fit myself - though I am not qualified either!Aga Rangemaster do not appear to have a Customer Services number that deals with any non-routine issues and so all I could do was use web chat.Essentially the web chat said that Rangemaster do not repair their own products if out of warranty and with it being 6 years old they will not repair it either.Rangemaster are offering no solution or means by which it can be repaired.So there you have it, 6 years appears to be the life expectancy of Aga Rangemaster Cookers! Rangemaster appear to only support their cookers for a maximum of 2 years, after which it may not be possible to get them repaired - I find this fairly shocking for such an expensive brand, and environmentally unconscionable."

Thats fine but I have now had to pay over \u00a3100 for an electrician and a gas safe engineer to come out and install it properly, both thought the delivery guys were at it.This is a complete joke after spending this amount of money and a cop out of providing any type of customer service whatsoever. Im very disappointed with this company and the lack of customer service is appalling."

          "Contenu": "Arrived with damaged side-panel, and the retailer promised Rangemaster themselves would be in touch to arrange suitable redress. Damage was not a big deal in itself, but when paying over \u00a33k for a range I expect it to be perfect, not a factory-second. Oh, and I've heard nothing from Rangemaster yet, although Christmas has been in the way, to be fair.Induction hob works okay but the control knobs feel flimsy, and the temperature markings on the oven controls are impossible to read unless you squat down so that they are at eye level. Ovens need a good burn-in - I'd suggest at least an hour on full heat - to avoid tainting the first couple of meals.Another small point; the shelf supports on the sides of the oven topple inwards easily unless a shelf is kept in place, preferably half way up the oven or higher. Also slightly disappointing that no solid oven trays are included, just wire shelves. Glide-out shelf supports are a nice touch though.I'd also suggest, on behalf of Rangemaster's retailers, that they give a little more thought to how such a heavy item can be more easily handled. Two guys delivered ours and really struggled - it's quite a lump."

          "Contenu": "We have a 60cm Rangemaster and were looking to replace it with a similar Gas/ Electric combination, with the smaller electric oven operating from a 13 amp plug, as that is the electric solution that was installed when we had the kitchen refurbished several years ago.  Looking for a new cooker this \"shortcoming\" in our electrics became apparent and many models required the \"normal\" dedicated 30 amp supply.  So, several enquiries of your (Rangemaster) chat line (22nd/23rd March) to see if you had a model to satisfy my requirements - initial responses were no.  Did a lot of internet searching and found model PROP90NGFCY/C on John Lewis and AO - enquired of Rangemaster chat whether this met my requirements fully, to be advised that they could not locate the model ???  This from the manufacturer !  Several customer reviews on AO spoke positively re the need for only a 13 amp supply for the electric oven - so we ordered, in CRANBERRY.  on 22nd March - supply problems so delivery not available before 24th May.  Full marks here - delivery was made, on schedule, on 24th May with AO keeping us well informed.  Installation team were great, cooker looked fantastic, really pleased with how it looked, UNTIL FINAL TESTING - gas engineer very frustrated as Gas Cooker would not light and then flame would go out.  He, in my view, quite rightly, refused to leave it in place as he said it was UNSAFE and so he uplifted and returned and installed our old unit (on which now a burner had failed during removal and reinstall).  FULL MARKS TO AO - they called me within 30 mins to apologise and checked availability with Rangemaster and scheduled delivery/ installation of new unit for 1st June.  I have received a further call from AO this morning (26th May) to advise that Rangemaster cannot now supply the said unit before w/c 5th June - so we are now scheduled delivery for Wednesday 7th June - fingers crossed.  Having had a Rangemaster for many, many years - this new model would be our fourth - I am concerned for the first time re whether quality standards have fallen and whether Rangemaster are as reliable as previously in their support as staff are not aware of model variants and delivery schedules can change at very short notice.  I look to rangemaster to restore my confidence as this experience has now shaken my previous firm belief in a great product with equally great support"

          "Contenu": "I love Falcon cookers and have owned one for over 10 years. So it was only natural when I moved house that I purchased a 2nd cooker at a cost of \u00a35000. I turned the cooker on for the first time. The Grill, induction and 2nd oven worked perfectly, turned on multifunction oven and bang. Called rangemaster/aga who make the falcon to tell them I had a faulty new cooker. It turns out they don't have their own engineers now but farm it out to 3rd parties. Customer service was useless, asking me if the clock had been set when the cooker does not even have a clock. Finally a guy was sent out from a local repair company after I complained to  Spillers of Chard the company I purchased it from, they quickly sorted it for me as they were not happy with the situation. He quickly found the fault as a live wire which had been damaged from a screw holding the casing which had gone through the cable causing it to earth on the back panel. This had caused a burn mark on the large back panel and the live cable to burn through. He stated this was clearly badly assembled by the company ,the wiring had not been clipped in when it was made. It was signed off by quality control but he thinks it was before the back panel was put on and then the panel was screwed through the cable. The guy who repaired my new cooker was excellent but he wasn't from Aga/Rangemaster. I had no phonecall from Aga/Rangemaster saying sorry just very poor customer service when I called them. This cooker is \u00a35000, it has a glossy brochure and a 3 year warranty but it is only as good as the weakest link and that is the aftercare. If Rangemaster/ Aga are making and selling premium cookers like Falcon , Mercury and Aga and charging a high price then please back it up with a premium aftercare especially when the cooker is brand new. Do I still love Falcon cookers, No! , would I buy a 3rd No ! . Sorry Aga/Rangermaster you have just lost a loyal customer."

No further comms so contacted Rangemaster this morning, they sent an email to supplier, I am still waiting for them to update me on what happens next.

          "Contenu": "I purchased a Rangemaster Kitchener from Currys. The wok burner gas ignition is intermittently faulty, often needing a few extra seconds to light and occasionally going out once lit. The smallest burner often takes 10 - 20 ignition clicks to light. I reported the fault to Rangemaster. I sent multiple videos of the faults but the wok burner was deemed user error so a job sheet was not sent for this - they sent an engineer from Repaircare to fix the small burner... I was not aware they had decided the wok was user error until he arrived. He cleaned the small burner even though I told him this was a fault from new - It still does not work.  Repaircare insist on sending the engineer on Wednesdays despite me telling them I work nights on Wednesdays. The engineer does not reply to messages so my cooker remains faulty. This is not my first Rangemaster .... I know how to ignite the gas rings."

All I can say, it is cheap and badly manufactured. The metal is so thin, where the tap is fitted, far too much movement. If you press down on any part, you will see the movement as the metal in the manufacture is too thin. I bought this online, if I had viewed this, would not have purchased.Also, the edges were not finished, would have cut my hands whilst fitting. Had to get wire wool and wet and dry to sand around the edges before fitting. Shame, but just to warn you please view this sink before you part with a large amount of money. Hope this helps one person.Response to reply The stability support was fitted under the tap, the metal is very thin on the whole sink and the finish to the edges was shocking"

It's the second one to do so  in a similar timeframe (different faults) and the original was replaced after I had to buy a new one and send it back for evaluation. I paid postage and a plumber on call-out, but better than being without a kitchen tap for three weeks while they made their minds up.So when the new one failed (13 months old) I began a conversation which has in fact lasted 3 weeks and so far hasn't seen delivery of the spares which they say will fix the issue. I don't think they will, so I bought a new one as before and now wish to return the dodgy one so they can examine it. This time they say their obligations end with a bag of spare parts and are not even interested in looking at the duff one. Even if the spares do eventually fix the issue, that's another month with no kitchen tap, and another plumber call-out charge. The tap costs all but \u00a3400, it's covered by a 5-year guarantee, but imho you're better off spending \u00a320 in B&Q.This situuation has now been resolved in terms of replacements and refunds,  and Rangemaster has done all that could be expected of them."

The installation instruction contained several errors, and the screws provided for fitting the chimney to the body of the hood were the wrong size. On first contacting Rangemaster by email, I had received no reply after 2 days, so I emailed the Head of Customer Services team (Rangemaster promise a response within 24 hours). A few days later I got an email apologising for the delay in responding and asking for details of the model I had bought. I replied immediately and have heard nothing since.Since posting this review I have had a call from Rangemaster\u2018s technical department; after explaining (again) the errors in the instruction manual, the gentleman I spoke to said he could see what the problems were, but nobody had pointed them out before. I later got an email from customer services which basically responded to my first message, but denied there was a problem with the instruction manual. Both these most recent communications offered to replace the parts for which the screws were incorrect."

          "Contenu": "Further to my original review below, about 3 weeks after the cooker was delivered I pulled it out to touch-up the paint work on the wall behind it, which had been marked during the installation of the electric cable. I noticed some brown marks on my brand new limestone floor in the area of the front feet of the cooker.  I tilted the cooker up, rested it on a block and removed the feet.  I was disappointed to discover that they were both rusty.  It seems that they were made of unpainted steel with no protective coating.  In the high humidity environment of a kitchen, this seems to be a very poor quality item.  Whilst the rust stain on my new floor tiles will be hidden when the cooker is in place, it has left a permanent mark.  This is disappointing from such a 'high end' product.  Two new feet are being sent and I am hoping that they will be painted or otherwise protected from moisture.We replaced our old green Rayburn boiler and cooker with a Rangemaster Classic Deluxe in British Racing Green in the same size: 90cm width. It was easy to install and, after just a week of use, seems to be working very well.  The only slight niggle was with the shelf supports in the tall oven, which did not seem to have been fitted correctly as I could not move any of the shelves to the bottom rungs.  However, a bit of pressure on the relevant supports managed to get them seated properly and the shelves now fit.  We have also had to get used to steam coming out of the oven when we open the door; with the Rayburn it used to go up the chimney!"

The cooker keeps becoming unstable so I have to regularly adjust the feet.  I have had issues with the timer buzzer not working and had to replace it - Not really good enough for a cooker that cost over \u00a31900. On the plus side the gas hob is really good, the fan oven seems to get a little hotter than indicated but cooks evenly etc... The standard oven its good but takes time to warm up. The grill is perfect.Overall I would rate it 3 but will never buy another. I'm waiting to write this off and upgrade.UPDATE 2/3/23 : I replied to the message from Ringmaster on the 17th Feb with no reply to date !UPDATE 5/4/23 : Rangemaster offered to send a replacement front for my cooker which I have now received (thank you) however they will not supply an engineer to fit it and have advised this is not a DIY job. They sent me a link to find an engineer, the cost is \u00a3156 which I have to pay - I have mixed feelings on this.  On one side they have admitted fault and sent a replacement but on the other I have been charged \u00a3156 to fit it.  Never mind, case over no more updates."

          "Contenu": "We ordered a rangemaster nexus SE110 induction from Cooks appliance Centre. It came all packed up but when opened we noticed the top glass and frame was bent (8mm) as though a large weight had been put on the top of the cooker and bowed the glass. Rangemaster were very good and we organised a replacement, but it took AGES to come. It was a new unit from the same supplier Cooks Appliance Centre. This was was even more bent than the first. We eventually agreed after 2 months that they would send out a replacement glass and fitter to replace it. Finally a flat cooker top!The range is great, the experience was not. Judging by the reviews on here, I\u2019m not the only one frustrated by shortcomings. I\u2019ve also noticed bent induction cooker tops on eBay so this happens more often than just our experience.I can only assume that the fault lies in how the cookers are handled during storage and shipping, likely stacked on top of each other. My advice to the operations manager of Aga / Rangemaster I would do one of two things;1. Take control of the delivery of my appliances in house - or via a single trusted partner. If this is too expensive, 2. Beef up the packaging - something akin to a motorcycle crate with wooden supports and able to be stacked. These cookers are clearly being stacked on top of each other resulting in damage that Rangemaster then have to sort out at their cost.  This costs Rangemaster time and money, when it\u2019s actually the logistics companies at fault. So to summarise, Rangemaster is good company (customer service is friendly but very slow) but it needs to work on its supply chain or risk losing customer goodwill."

The third party couldn`t come for 9 days travelling from Liverpool to South Manchester ( was there no one available in Manchester ? ) .  I rang our supplier AO who were very good in the circumstances and we managed to push harder to get a repair engineer out within a couple of days with their help. Rangemaster customer services rep promised to call me to keep me updated on the progress of the repair before it happened and said they`d offer some sort of compensation depending on the fault found ( I didn`t ask for this - we`d have preferred a working cooker  ) . I rang the following day asking for an explanation as to why no one had called me and was told my message would be passed on . I`m still waiting for that call a week later.It turned out to be a loose connection and easily fixed.I couldn`t comment on the function of the cooker itself as we`ve hardly used it so far.We are hoping the cooker lives up to the 5 star ratings we used to purchase it.The company itself however gets 3 stars on this occasion."

It looks good and its dual ovens are sizeable and really help when having to cook things at different temperatures, keeping things warm or big events like Christmas. Where the range master cookers really let themselves down is their depth of oven and grill. The grill is really shallow. You are able to cook something like bacon on the slide in grill but anything bigger like browning a macaroni cheese the dish is unlikely to fit in and you have to turn the dish around to grill the other side. Or a pork chop basically is in contact with the grill bars. A simolar size issue happens with the tall oven. They accommodate a baking tray but anything longer like a casserole dish and bad luck you can\u2019t do it. Why the grill and tall oven are so shallow is strange as the cooker is pretty big. We didn\u2019t realise until we bought it and its been a pain ever since, especially considering the cost of the oven you\u2019d expect more. Also all lettering and numbers and chrome seem to be falling off the control knobs. So its not looking great after 2 years. Other than that the oven is great. But a gentle warning if you like cooking you\u2019ll get frustrated."

          "Contenu": "EDIT 24/11/22... After a few emails offering me a repair to my brand new cooker which I declined I have finally received another cooker today.  Rangemaster could not supply a black one as ordered,  so they sent a green one and a technician to wire it in and swap the doors over from the one that doesn't work and I have to say as always I love it! Thank you to the managers at Rangemaster who tried to come up with solutions to help me.  There were one or two at the beginning who were not helpful at all. I also want to mention the company Rangecookers.co.uk as i bought my cooker through them. They really couldn't have done any more to ensure I received a new cooker asap.  31/10/22 I received a brand new Rangemaster cooker last week, \u00a33000 worth. This will be my 3rd Rangemaster over the years and until now I have had no issues with them, however unfortunately this one has an electrical fault and blew all my electrics the first time it was switched on. This appears to have been caused by a bare wire under a soldered panel and no fault of the electrician. PROBLEM *** Rangemaster customer service are seriously letting this company down. They have received photographs, electrical reports and a full explanation of the events and since then all I have received from them is an email requesting photographs of the \"scratches\" I am unhappy with!!!! I have contacted them pointing out that I am not complaining about \"scratches\" but the fact my brand new cooker has blown up!!! ...... and nothing..... nothing at all....I fear trading standards may be my only way forward."

I will rarely use the second oven, as there\u2019s only 2 of us, but it\u2019s handy having a large second oven. The oven doors could be better as you have to make sure it is closed. With my previous range I just pushed the door and it caught without a problem.  You do get what you paid for and  the Toledo is a bit tinny compared to my previous range which was a dual range. But the time spent in not having to slave over my cooker when cleaning it is fabulous."

We like have controls by old-style knobs rather than on the hob itself. The ovens are a good size compared to many alternatives. The only downside is that the ovens do not reach the temperatures sown on the dials. They have improved a little with use, but are still typically 10 - 15 degrees less hot in reality compared with the dial. Rangemaster said this was normal, but we would expect a new range cooker to be accurate rather than having to adapt to its discrepancies. It\u2019s certainly important to have an oven thermometer to understand the real temperatures. Also, the grill section cannot easily be used as a plate warmer, as suggested, because the grill pan takes up too much space and is not easy to take out. Generally, we are happy with our purchase."

However, the owner, my mother-in-law, has aged and is not working well.  She is getting forgetful and although the glass lid closure turns off a gas burner left on - her sinus problems mean that she is not smelling the gas when the next day\u2019s opening of the lid means unlit gas continues to come out into the kitchen - and of course her failing hearing means that she does not even hear it hissing out.This is arguably just as (or could be even more) hazardous as one of the gas burners left on at the time she has been using it - as she could then see it when cleaning up the kitchen.  The following day however, she has forgotten she ever used the burner.I had hoped that something could be fitted to fix this - but was told not.  I really do think that Rangemaster could and should be able to provide advice to fix this even if they themselves can not."

So why not 5 stars? Two things: first- probably my fault for not reading the spec properly - but it has two fan ovens whereas my old one had one fan and one multi function oven. I didn't realise this didn't have the multi function option as I prefer non fan for baking but there you go I'll just have to deal with it. Second, the grill is small for such a large oven, although I do like the slide out bars it sits on so no more having to hold the grill pan with one hand whilst turning food over with the other. Overall I am really pleased I chose this model."

          "Contenu": "We purchased a new black 110 Esprit Rangemaster this Summer and installed it in the Autumn following the completion of our renovation. It's a super model, we found the product details, delivery and service great. The cooker grill and ovens are super efficient. Happy with our choice.We discovered once it was installed, one of the lights didn't work on the oven dials. Covered under warranty, someone came to inspect it within 48hrs of reporting it. We are now waiting for the item to come into stock so it can be replaced - to note the oven itself does work, just not the light.The gas hob rings get marked super easily and we've been advised it isn't particularly easy to get the burn marks off (without using a scourer or similar which will mark them), which is pretty disappointing in light of the cost the cooker."

          "Contenu": "Purchased a Rangemaster 110 induction in March 2022. Duly registered with Rangemaster and received our warranty from their appointed rep Homeserve for a 2 year '24/7 365 day' call number. Today our Rangemaster suddenly went \"bang\" and tripped the circuit breaker whilst using one oven and 1 ring of the induction hob to cook Mothering Sunday meal. Rang the number on the Homeserve warranty, got directed to a premium rate number, used 'just say no' to get normal call rate. Rep said no one could help as all offices closed until 9am Monday but gave a number to 'try'. Recorded message from rangemaster/aga to try again in normal office hours. Totally useless and false representation. Shame on Rangemaster and Homeserve.UPDATE - after a very poor start, Rangemaster pulled out all the stops to remedy the problem. They sent a local Rangemaster approved electrician who quickly diagnosed that the installation by AO was incorrect. The wires were crossed over and over time had burned through the wire casing which had tripped the consumer unit. He was able to repair the wiring so that we could safely use the appliance and ordered a new electrical board from Rangemaster. Unfortunately the first board was an incorrect part but the right one did arrive a week later and was fitted by the electrician. although the fault was by the AO installation, Rangemaster paid the bill and ensured that we did not have to chase AO for recompense. Thank you Rangemaster and Grange Electrical, Birkenhead"

I have now received the replacement sink thanks to Eugenie's intervention and feel that I should update my review to reflect the good customer service I have received.I purchased a Rangemaster Double Belfast ceramic sink from Tap Warehouse in November 2021.  I was attracted to this product owing to the Aga Rangemaster brand which I viewed as premium and because the sink came with a 10 year warranty.  The sink developed some pock marks after a year or so, so I contacted Rangemaster and sent some photographs.  Rangemaster acknowledged that the sink was faulty and offered to replace it.  When I said that I had installed the sink in my French holiday home they refused to honour the warranty as I had \"exported\" the sink.  Nowhere on the Tap Warehouse website nor Rangemaster's was it stipulated that the warranty would not be valid if the sink were \"exported\".  I have asked several times where this information can be found and have yet to be told.  Frankly, I am disgusted with this service and would suggest that it may be indicative of potential difficulties with other warranty claims."

After a lot of research we purchased a Professional + FX 100 back in March 2022 as a replacement for our 9 year old John Lewis (Smeg) which was taking 45 mins to reach 220 deg. and then had the fan running for another 40 minutes after being switched off. We chose the FX for the well sized smaller oven which we use most of the time, and in preference to the 4 door arrangements which would require too much bending down. Overall, it is a vast improvement with better, more accurate temperature control, quicker oven heat-up and cools down without running the fan.  The pan supports are very solid and heavy (2kg - 4+kg).  There are a few niggles, though.  The oven control knobs are hard to read, with very light symbols and an angled face which picks up reflections. The large and useful drawer has no handle so one has to reach  below to open it.  The wok burner is over the smaller oven and would be better in the middle, with two conventional burners either side.  This would allow more room for everyday use (unless one uses the wok every day)."

          "Contenu": "A beautiful cooker that has many great features. I bought it about four months ago and use it every day. I just wanted experience as many of its features as possible before writing a review.ProsExcellent main fan oven.Baking tray attached to the main oven door is convenient to use.All five burners with different power outputs. Burners are well spaced and have solid pan supports. The wok burners is great for stir fry and cooking in large pots.Knobs are well marked, particularly the oven knobs have temperatures written on the knob and the fascia panel.Good grill but need to keep an eye on it while it is being used as it could overcook quickly.ConsNo quick start guide provided.The instruction manual is written for three different models in one manual. Did not mentioned anywhere that the cooker needs be connected to 32A electrical supply.No light in the tall oven or in the grill.Minute minder beeper sound is disappointingly too low even when set to its maximum. It is difficult to hear when it beeps from a few metres away from the cooker.  My old 1990's Leisure gas cooker beeper was audible from several metres away. No griddle supplied for Kitchener.Dust and small pieces of plastic/metal were inside the oven when bought it as new."

          "Contenu": "My Rangemaster Professional Plus was installed on Oct 14th and within 30minutes of the installers leaving I had to call my retailer to schedule a maintenance appointment. The door on the main oven was catching on the side panel making it difficult to open and close the door and making the most awful noise, and I also didn't know what additional damage I might be doing if I continued to open and close the door, so I did not use the main oven.  Rangemaster were prompt, I had the requested call within a week and the diagnosis was a new side panel had to be fitted.  This apparently is not an uncommon occurrence.  Within two weeks from installation I had a new panel fitted and the oven is now great.  I very much like the range over my old Smeg, and have swapped from gas to induction which is a bit of a learning curve but no regrets.  I feel that Rangemaster QC processes at the manufacturing facility should have caught the issue before the range left the factory."

When it became clear that the appliance couldn\u2019t be repaired, she tried really hard to find a replacement that could be delivered prior to Christmas. Sharon then put me through to Sam in sales who was equally helpful in helping me to find a new cooker. She clearly spent a great deal of time analysing the range of appliances then sent a personal email with a selection appropriate to my requirements. Both Sharon and Sam were so professional, understanding and friendly. Rangemaster should be proud of their excellent customer service. I only wish I could say the same about other companies. it is also worth mentioning that my cooker turned out to be 22 years old so has given me a very good service indeed. I have no hesitation whatsoever in buying another Rangemaster and recommend the brand and service at the highest level."

A very professional chap came quickly, identified the fault and ordered the spare part. I then called up on the 5th of December to chase what was going on. I used the online chat service and Matt Boyle will be chasing this up and getting back to me by phone to let me know repair updates and dates for the technician to return.

And stress free. When a company acts quickly for their customers that\u2019s when it counts."
