Garbage website, garbage service!Suspend the account first then tell you that you engage in restricted behavior, no refunds at all after that, and if clicking on a shopping site is restricted behavior, then you guys don't want to be agents. I purchased 200 proxies and they won't let me click on shopping sites?First you suspend my account, then you ask me to verify, why didn't you prompt me when I paid you? Fraudulent site, and I need to explain my behavior? Your agent has an extremely high fraud score of 90% and is not working at all, not fixing the problem and asking me to explain my behavior, are you living in a dream world?"

          "Contenu": "I've been using Webshare for a few months. Their standard proxies perform decently.However, I recently tried their Google Proxies, which are marketed as guaranteed to work with Google Search. These proxies cost ten times more than their regular plans.Unfortunately, since purchasing, I've faced numerous issues. I consistently received blocks from Google. It's been days, and the support team has yet to offer a solution or even a meaningful response.Considering that Oxylabs acquired Webshare last year, this experience paints both companies in an unprofessional light.I'd advise against relying on their Google Proxies, despite the claims that they work seamlessly. In my experience, they simply don't.Update as of September 21st: They have now been in touch with me, and a long email exchange has ensued. They have subsequently offered to credit my money back.Update October 3th:Proxy replacement was activated. However, they only replace proxies every four hours. This wasn\u2019t what I anticipated when I purchased proxies guaranteed to work with Google.Webshare continues to bombard me with numerous emails and refuses to honor my request to stop contacting me.I\u2019ll continue using them for regular proxies. But for Google proxies, this product is not viable."

They refuse to return the money and refuse to resume using the proxy and compensation for unused days. DO NOT RECOMMEND! VERY PROBLEMATIC PROXY PROVIDER!"

Meaning you can buy a month and then when you want to cancel the sub so you don't get charged next month they IMMEDIATELY cancel the subscription you PAID FOR.Deceptive slimy practices avoid this company. I hope the people who work at this company are proud to accept the money and work for such a scam."

          "Contenu": "I admit proxies are good. However, there is no way you can use them for long. I was suspended for no reason (logging in often to openai) after a month of using their proxies. You sell plans for 100s of proxies for what? For personal anonymous browsing of internet or watching videos? Why you need so much proxies for that. If you do literally anything that requires a lot of proxies, they will suspend your account. And after i was suspended, they keep charging me money. Got charged $35 twice before i noticed. Sure there was no refund or anything, my message about that was ignored (got automated message saying i will have a reply in 1-2 days, but its been a week and there was no response).Edit: they said they have contacted me but got no reply. It was the opposite. I contacted them, my email was \"Please cancel my subsription and refund me. I was suspended, how on earth it is possible that you still charge me money, even twice\"They indeed replied, their response was: Thank you for contacting us, we will reply you in 1-2 days. (That was 10 days ago). And thats it.As of them contacting me, they sent me a email asked what i use proxies for. I answered i use them to login to openai. Then they asked to upload my documents. The verification link they sent was not working, i asked to resend it it was the same. That doesnt matter anyway, i dont want to upload any documents to them and explain my proxy use since i was not doing anything illegal using their proxy. And no i dont want to email you again to wait 1-2 days for no reply, you !have my email and account! just refund me these 2 charges and thats itSo to sum it up: you can use their proxies they are good, just keep in mind that when they will suspend you (which would probably happen) close your subsription asap, otherwise they will keep charging  you money and will not refund anything."

          "Contenu": "I was using webshare.io for some time with GSA SER. One day they contacted me asking for the purposes I am using their service.I clearly answered - for GSA. The answer - thanks, everything is OK. Two weeks later I extended my subscription for another month and a couple of days later proxies stopped working.No email message, nothing - on their dashboard - account suspended. After contacting support I got an answer that one of their proxies I used was blacklisted in spam databases, so they banned my account without any refund.Webshare sent me a link to complain - it seems one of their IP was reported by someone for spam.But it is the nature of any automated SEO tool.Let's look at what offers webshare.io exactly: - webshare . io/l/gsa-proxy-server- webshare . io/l/rankerx-proxy-server(remove spaces around . )They asked me to provide government ID verification to \"maybe\" unban the account.But I don't share my government issued documents left and right to unknown companies/individuals over the internet.So in conclusion webshare.io will ban your account and keep your money for a single IP report to any spam database.About the service in general:Almost all freshly bought IPs already are blacklisted and banned, the success ratio of SEO tools is very low due to this.EDIT: webshare.io - remove the links I have mentioned in my review above misleading people about what your service is suitable for GSA and RankerX; add a warning on your website that your service is FORBIDDEN to use with SEO tools."

The api provide full control over your proxies.The proxies generally work as expected. However I started experiencing early on minor annoyances. It started with multiple hour long api outages. One of my proxies where automatically replaced, however my app couldn\u2019t update it, since the api was down. These outages happened on a regular basis (Once every 1-2 months)They also seemingly made a breaking api change, which required the request url path to end with / for some reason.Worst of all was the recent proxy issues. Proxies randomly stopped working, but wasn\u2019t replaced as usual. The support answered once per day, but couldn\u2019t provide me what I paid for, while this issue was ongoing. This cost me a lot of time, annoyed my users and decreased my revenue. It took 1 month to solve that issue. They are lucky that I was that patient, since any other customer would switch to another service. Reasons for staying with webshare remain the price, since competitors are at least 2x that expensive. And webshare provided me for  about half a year everything I needed mostly flawlessly."

I paid the monthly price today and tried to change a proxy. After half an hour trying I gave up and decided to cancel the service, because I found a service cheaper somewhere else that matches my needs better, but of course I wanted to use the proxies until the end of the subscription and use the new service from next month.I looked in their help center, how to cancel the subscription. The only way is to switch to free plan, which will be done immediately, so I lost my proxies and my money.The dashboard is also complicated and unclear. If you want to change anything that is allegedly  included in your subscription, you will automatically pay and start a new subscription.UPDATE: I was contacted by the support and they were very nice and helpful and offered to reinstate my account, but I declined politely.Therefore I changed my rating from 2 to 3. They are apparently trying to make it right. If they make the system more flexible and more userfriendly, then I might even come back."

Most are in USA France and Netherlands.Hope they continue to get better, i really like their service."

AMAZING.We had a few issues navigating the process of authentication as we changed from IP whitelisting to API however Webshare admins have been INCREDIBLE!!!!We are just amazed at how they always answer quickly and with detail that we have never received from other providers. We began with a small package and regardless of the amount of money we spent each month, Customer Support has continuously engaged us quickly and efficiently. We cant say enough great things about them. After using several other well known providers of high quality rotating residential proxies, we have happily found a proxy company we will stay Loyal too.
