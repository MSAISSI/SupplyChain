Moral of the story AVOID their online store, and get your Redragon products on Amazon, were you will get it in 2 - 3 days with out any need of writing a bad review to get their attention and get them to make things right. Redragon needs a live chat on their website and need to do better about notifying customers that packaging may take a prolong amount of time, and the covid excuse isnt working on anyone anymore."

Although I had an issue with the first unit I bought, I'm almost sure it was because I had dropped the keyboard from a high surface.Right out of the box, the feel, build quality, and over all aesthetics just jump. It feels like a premium built $120+. The lighting effects, however, are very lacking. The model I bought only comes with a few pre programmed light modes, but hey for this price id happily give that up.I think I definitely would try their other products, if your looking for something nice and affordable consider this brand."

The cable could have been longer, but that's an easy problem to fix.The Horus is a great keyboard for a secondary PC or to connect to other devices you'd want to use a keyboard with. It's very lightweight and compact while still being a full keyboard with useful macros.While I was able to find replacement key switches on another site for the Horus, I'd appreciate it far more if they were sold directly on Redragon, or there was a link to them. I'd like to be able to switch them out.The charging light for when it's plugged in is a bit too bright as well for my tastes.However... these are the only real complaints I have, and all of them can be addressed.I'd recommend Redragon to anyone who's looking to get nice PC accessories at an entry level price without sacrificing quality or functionality."

          "Contenu": "Good products and customer service. I ordered the Invader Pro 719 wireless to replaced the wired invader mouse I currently have, and bought the Noctis K632 along with it because I wanted to try a 60% keyboard.The order was placed but I soon received an email telling me the Pro 719 was out of stock. I was offered to wait until it's in stock, cancel the mouse order, or exchange it for the Taipan Pro M810. I chose to exchange it. I had to pay the difference of $3.24 for the other mouse, which I thought was a little strange, because it's supposed to be an exchange, but whatever. The mouse arrived a little later than the keyboard because of the exchange.When I got the keyboard, I was a little confused because the box says Horus Mini Pro instead of Noctis 632, but the product is the same as the keyboard I ordered. It took me a minute to figure out how to switch between connection modes (you use the fn key and q-t) and how the fn2 key worked because there were no instructions. I also had to look up how the macro keys worked, and am disappointed that the G1-G4 keys can't be assigned macros from the keyboard software, but that wasn't the main reason I got the keyboard so it's not a dealbreaker. There's another button with a speaker/sun icon which I'm still not sure what it does, or what all of the fn2 keys do, but I'm very happy with how the keyboard feels and types.I haven't used the mouse a lot yet, but well, it's a mouse. There's not much to say. It works, I can adjust the DPI and lighting and set macros."

My first mouse that I received was broken from the start but got sent a new one by customer service immediately, but now this one broke too. Erin from customer service was once again incredibly helpful to figure my problem out, but once we came to the conclusion that it wasn't fixable, I was offered solutions to compensate for my broken item. So unfortunately I had two items that didn't work well/were broken, but in the end I was offered so many solutions and help that I am still a happy customer and will definitely return in the future if I'm ever in need of more items for my gaming setup. I have other items from them that do work incredibly well, so I might have just gotten some bad luck with my mice."

About 4 months later, one of the keys was faulty. I contacted customer service and was informed that the switch is hot-swappable.Carrie stepped in, offered me a replacement since it was still under warranty (different model since there was no stock of my model), and had it all done very swiftly. I was charged a bit for delivery, but for some reason I took no issue with that.Later on,  I tried to remove the key switches on the faulty keyboard for practice since it was meant to be discarded anyway. I ended up breaking the switch. There was no indication anywhere that the switches could be removed, and I subsequently found a thread on reddit suggesting that this was not possible.Anyway, long story short: I have a working keyboard now with no fuss and lots of good communication with Carrie."

          "Contenu": "Pretty good product. It has a nice quality finish, bright LEDs and many configurable options. Bluetooth and 2,4Ghz wireless works great with no noticeable lag. The low profile keyboard looks great as well. Battery life is decent. I haven't pinpointed the exact duration, but it seems to be at least 2 days with a few hours of work in each of those.It looses 1 star because of the following:Macro keys feels very mushy and low quality. They do have decent lighting though. Volume wheel works great when the keyboard is wired, but when used wirelessly, it requires too many turns to lower the volume just a bit. It just becomes faster to do it directly on screen with your mouse. I would like to be able to select the color of the LEDs. There are 9 options, but orange/amber isn't one of them. It may not be a big problem for most, but it's a bit disapointing when that's the color you are going for.Overall, good product with just a few minor flaws."

Had it previously. The problem was that the middle mouse button sometimes stopped working. Tried to open the mouse, was unsuccessful, so had to throw it out :D. Anyway, the previous mouse lasted for 3-4 years, so the performance/price ratio is extremely high. Would recommend this mouse to anyone, who wants a \"budget\" gaming mouse that, paradoxically, performs like the more expensive variants."

I ordered two sets of switches, one of which arrived promptly through Amazon shipping, while the other was delivered a bit later by USPS.Initially, there was a bit of confusion regarding the delivery, but I must commend the exceptional customer service team for their prompt and efficient assistance in resolving the issue. Their support played a significant role in making the overall experience a positive one. In fact, I was so impressed with their assistance that I went ahead and purchased a third set of switches.Onto the switches themselves. I'm thoroughly impressed with the quality. These switches offer a very smooth typing experience. Even the tactile/bump style switches provide a satisfying feel, striking a balance between a pronounced tactile response and a comfortable, non-stiff sensation. What particularly caught my attention was how well the silent switches perform. They manage to maintain their quiet operation without compromising on the keypress's tactile feedback, avoiding the typical 'mushy' sensation that can sometimes accompany silent switches.In summary, I can confidently say that the Red Dragon mechanical keyboard switches have exceeded my expectations both in terms of product quality and customer service. The combination of great products and excellent service is a winning formula, and I wouldn't hesitate to make a purchase from Red Dragon again in the future."

          "Contenu": "I just can't believe how amazing this company is. You can always expect something great for the right price without having to spend hundreds of dollars on other brands. I feel recently they have updated their switches at least the \"reds\" for the FIZZ 60% keyboard. They have this nice little grip to them that makes it feel comfortable to press. Some may like it while others may like a much faster feel. The older ones on my other Redragon K582RGB V2 board were like that. There's hits and misses with having a 60% keyboard but if you know that then you come to expect what you're getting. Macro's in most cases help make bindings better and it helps for the arrow keys which may come useful for some games and dos games. The RGB is utterly fantastic. I feel the lighting is much better on this keyboard then my previous as well. It's snappy small and just right for gaming. You just have to make sure you set your macro's right and deal with not having a Prtsc button. There's other software that will give you keybinding screenshots so Prtsc doesn't need to be the all out. Beautiful keyboard and lots more space to deal with now :)."
