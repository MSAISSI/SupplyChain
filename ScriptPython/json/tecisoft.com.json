On the fourth day, noticing the order had not shipped yet, I contacted the company to be told the item was on back order and would not be shipped for 2-3 weeks.  IMO that information should have been available during checkout or on the website like many other sites provide. At the very least, a courtesy email would have been appreciated.  It's a shame I had to find out about the delay the way I did.  I cancelled my order and will find a more reputable source."

I contacted them the same day and 3 days later they write me back and say it was my fault those items were not included. Instead of sending me the items that I paid for that they assured me came with it they wanted me to return and not honor their word. It\u2019s horrible communication after you purchase an item. They don\u2019t answer the phone, or call you back. I have screenshots of the entire conversation from Tecisoft to back up my review."

I placed an order with them on 9/21/2022 for a Kingston SD card and reader. The item expected to ship within 2 to 3 weeks. After 10 days, I hadn't seen any status updates and I had been charged for the item. I personally don't like when companies take payment weeks before an item is shipped. Tecisoft understood my concerns and reversed the charge and said they would still follow through with the order. On 10/17/2022, I finally received my order. This was slightly longer than the estimated shipping window, but I did get my order with the correct items. Tecisoft seems to be a reputable company that I would order from again."
