When they received it they sent another offer increasing what they wanted to pay because the condition was better than I thought. That, to me, is the definition of a company being honest and having integrity and stellar customer service and should be recognized! Great job Topcalcs!"

When it arrived, the screen had a permanent pixelation in the top right-hand corner. I followed the return process and emailed them Friday. Since Monday was a holiday they didn't respond till Tuesday and set me up with a Blue TI 83 Plus not the one I originally wanted but hey it works 100% and at a great price! With the help provided and the short turn around I gave this a five-star rating because not only did they honor their word on the warranty/return policy. They helped me out without any hassle or grief, exchange was simple and included a return shipping label. Thank you Topcalc for taking care of me! I will definitely recommend to my classmates!"
