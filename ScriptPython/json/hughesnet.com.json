Then every month we have to call because they over-charge us by $25 for a service we don't have but they say we do so it's a constant back and forth argument about what service we do have. Not worth the time or effort."

          "Contenu": "When I opted for Hughes Net Gen 5 service, the name on my account was recorded by a very poor English speaker representative as Douglass. I didn\u2019t know of the mistake until my statement arrived. That was three years ago!!!!! Apparently Hughes Net didn\u2019t seem to care that three years of monthly bills were actually being paid on a Visa Card, ending in 1555 by me , Dennis not Douglass!!!!! Over the years , when I talked to representatives, I tried to get my name corrected but without success.  So now I wish to terminate my contract and have been asked to \u201cprove\u201d there is no Douglass in my house by sending personal documents via E-FAX to a fax number 5854193727. I submitted my documents repeatedly to this number and received error messages. First it was denied, then it was accepted, then it was denied. After 3/4 calls to Hughes service centre, they were unable to verify the fax had arrived, they were unable to look at my visa name to verify that it was Dennis paying for the service for the last three years, they were unable to provide another fax number, in fact they were unable to suggest anyway of resolving this simple but stupid problem after several hours!!!!! My wife even called the fax number and was told \u201c the e-fax  did not go through because someone answered the call\u201d and that the number was a scam. So I called my ViSA company and put a block on my Hughes Net payment next month as a way of canceling this service on Jan 18th 2024.  I hope that Hughes will provide a box and shipping label so that I can send their equipment back next month. The Hughes Net service has been great, their service center in Rochester NY  has been appalling. Would not recommend them to anyone after this."

I bought the dish and related equipment and, when asked, i told people that Hughes was better than having no internet. I recently found a much less expensive hotspot service with unlimited highspeed and emailed ot cancel my Hughes service. I received a response by email informing me I must telephone to cancel servie. During that too long conversation i was informed there would be a $400 cancellation fee. Again, I purchased their equipment so they had no costs to disconnect my service. I asked repeatedly to speak with a supervisor and was not transferre.I was referred to the Hughes contract by text. There is a cancellation fee described in their legal docs."

          "Contenu": "I was a Hughesnet subscriber for a total of 11 years. I can honestly say this is the worst internet provider I have ever had. You purchase their service and it will be okay for 1 month. After you have gotten past your 30 day window then your service is degraded to the other subscribers level. When you call customer service you will be speaking to someone you can hardly understand reading from a script to \u201ctry\u201d to diagnose your problem. They will tell you everything looks good on their end and will ask how the weather is in your area. After this you may be issued a case number and be told they will turn it over to the engineering department and they will be back in touch with you. They will tell you that they are sorry and may either give you a little data or knock 10 dollars off your bill. Your speed may increase for a few days and then it will go right back to the way it was. If you decide you want to cancel your service they will send you to their \u201ccustomer retention\u201d department where you will speak to an American who will either say they will escalate your case and give you a rebate for a few months and some extra data if you will give them a chance to \u201cfix\u201d the problem. Hughesnet has oversold their service and there\u2019s only one way to \u201cfix\u201d the problem, find another internet provider. I HIGHLY recommend Starlink if it is available in your area. The upfront cost is about $600 dollars but it is well worth it, especially compared to Hughesnet. There is no comparison between the two. Starlink has times when your internet slows somewhat due to congestion but you still have usable internet. I\u2019m not saying Starlink is the best option but if you\u2019re having to use satellite internet it is definitely worth looking into. If I can only save one person the agony of dealing with Hughesnet my review will be worth while."

The service has not been that great, and the costs are high, but I stuck with it and paid my bills timely. Recently, my husband had to have any knee replacement and money has been very tight. I\u2019ve had to takeoff work to take care of him. I called Hughesnet and asked for an extension to pay my bill at a later date which was only a week and a half. As time drew closer to the extended date, I realized that I could only make a partial payment so I called on two separate occasions to try to make a partial payment and schedule the rest to be paid on another another date a week later. This is the first time I have ever been late in over 10 years, Mind you. When I called these two times, I was told back to call back on the date that I had promised to pay and make the partial payment. When I called that day, they told me that they sent it to my bank to be paid and the whole bill was extracted from my checking account and it was overdrawn. If I was not told by two separate people from the Hughesnet  company that I could call on that date and pay a partial payment, I wouldn\u2019t be so upset. When I called on the arranged date, they said it could not be done that my payment was already withdrawn and that basically they got their money and there\u2019s nothing I can do about it. When a company has no compassion for their customers, they have no business being a company. Needless to say, I will be canceling my Hughesnet service, and will be sure to spread the word what kind of company this really is."

On top of that, my data would only last five to seven days at the start of a billing cycle, that was with streaming Netflix three to four days a week,  maybe one to two hours, either way, fairly light internet use. Even when I did have data most streaming devices were pixelated and would not make it through an entire episode before freezing and disconnecting. I constantly had to unplug and reset the router. When I went to cancel my service I found out there was a $400 cancellation fee. You also have to return all the equipment yourself otherwise you will get charged and extra $300. I just switched to starlink and it works phenomenally for anything I want."

They tried to hold me to contracts that they blatantly stated were \"incorrect\", charged me over $300/month for a product that worked less than 70% of the time, provided \"support\" that could barely read let alone understand the script. I had to reset my entire network every morning and it would still take me more than an hour to have semi-functioning Internet, which would still drop periodically throughout the day. I had one tech explain to me \"space is really far away and it takes a long time for the signal to get there and back\" and tell me that the weather looked overcast in my area, while I was staring out the window at clear blue skies. It cost me $8000 to be able to use Starlink, and it was worth every cent to get away from HughesNet. The last week of dealing with them left me crying and shaking because it was so stressful and difficult. I will be setting that dish up with Tannerite, since it can't function for Internet anyway."

Long story short we decided to cancel our service and they can't even cancel it and send us a box to send their equipment back until the end of the billing cycle! How insane is that. We haven't had service since the middle of October and we can't get a box until the end of November. The inefficiency of this company is amazing.  I would not recommend them to anyone.  In fact before this I have always steered people away from them. If you live in the country and want great internet try T-mobile. It saved us $34 a month and no 15g metered internet limit!!!

I had to explain numerous times to start my new account, giving my account number again and again. I told the representative that the technician had installed a new modem and I needed to ensure that my husband's account was cancelled and I had a new account which needed to be activated. I was told my account had been done incorrectly with my husband's name on my account.  No one at Hughesnet could find my account number. I kept telling everyone the account number that was my husband's needed to be cancelled. That I couldn't put my name on his account, I had a new account and kept telling the representative my account number, which he couldn't find. That should have been an easy fix, delete my husband's account and start my new account. I was totally confused and asked to speak with a supervisor. Only when I spoke to a supervisor at the account management dept did I feel the issues of starting a new account was resolved. Now I get another email scheduling a techician on Nov 20 to install a new modem. On Nov 15 the technician had completed this work and I signed the agreement the work was finished.

On top of the ridiculously expensive disconnect fee, we were charged for 2 extra months of service, even after fully confirming that our service was canceled with confirmation that we WOULD NOT be charged for anything further. They were not helpful at all when trying to reach a resolution and I would suggest to anyone to steer clear of Hughes Net if they don't want to spend hundreds of extra dollars for a service they aren't even using."

I waited and called the next day and got connected to a lady, who spoke better English and know how to solve my prblem. After about 10-15 minutes she got me connected and so far so good."

I have emailed them and did not receive a response back. I called them and the agent (who was very difficult to understand) told me I should receive it by 11/05/23. I still have not received my 5 GB \u201cfree\u201d token. I\u2019ve used HN for a long time and have not had any trouble like this before. Thank you**Edit:  this matter has been resolved as I have now received my 5 GB token.  Change from 1 star to 5 stars. Thanks!"

I asked if I Can just cancel it and still stream and do what I needed and was told yes. When I called back again, they said I will continually have streaming issues (even video calls) because I cancelled the Fusion service and that was my issue, They DO NOT WANT TO FIX ANYTHING! They blame the customer for everything that goes wrong with the service and can not accept any accountability for what the customer reps tell the customers. I have been hung up on multiple times."

The technician basically said \" oh your devices still use data when you sleep\" even though the connected devices' numbers don't support 17 gb of usage , and its never used that much over night. I got a brick wall and a repetition of the same explanation without any questions actually being answered. It feels like their data usage evaluation is aa scam and in no way accurate.

I speak to a rep and I am told I am receiving a refund because she can see that what I am saying is accurate.  On 3/30 I still have not received my refund.  When I call in I am told that Michelle did not leave any notes.  Talked to several people and spent over 40 minutes trying to get this taken care of. The 'Acct Manager' kept putting me on hold just saying they are looking into this.  Then he tells me he can only credit me one month of service, and only credit my Hughesnet account not my credit card. I had to ask for a supervisor, wait another 10+ minutes, then got my refund on my card.  This is a very poor way to run a business.  The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because the 2nd person I spoke to today was very nice, thorough, and understanding.

The representative did tell me that it would cost me $150 for a service call if they sent someone out. Since we recently established HughesNet service and a representative came out multiple times to work on the system because of a problem HughesNet detected, and we still have an issue, that HughesNet would not charge for a service call."

No one told us how our next bill would be coming,so used our Debit card which we did not authorize and got a note that they cant use it. I was waiting for an invoice but no one TOLD us our monthly bill comes on line. So, now we need to pay $5.00 a month for an INVOICE, PLUS they charged us $25.00 for the pole. I gave them my MasterCard for that only but future payment will be by a check when I receive my monthly bill. I also want to be notified when my two year contract date is to expire. It does not cost $5.00 per mo to mail an invoice.  No one informed us about that extra $60/per yr from the beginning. Not sure if I want to continue this after the two year contract expires. Anymore surprises in the billing in future best NOT HAPPEN unless advance notices thru the mail. Elizabeth Herod"

          "Contenu": "Signed up for the new Fusion plan...supposed to be so much faster and more reliable.  When it works it usually is faster, (most of the time) but no more reliable.  It goes out for no apparent reason.  It may not stay out for long, but it does go out pretty often and it doesn't have to be storming. The main issue I have is the price.  When I signed up for the Fusion there was 2 options, 50G/Month & 100G/Month.  I wanted to start with the 50G/month to see if we would be able to stream movies, etc. and if not, they said I could change the plan.  They offered a discount on the 100/month plan for 6 months, so I opted to go that route; however, since we still can't stream movies I wanted to go back to the 50/Month plan...No Longer Offered!  Now the 100G/Month plan is their base plan for Fusion and the price is 196.00/month - ridiculous.  I appreciate the internet service because we live in an area where we don't have a lot to choose from and I work from home, but I wish I would not have changed at all.  As soon as my new contract is up I will be changing to a different provider."

The fella kept asking me questions, and then said I would have to call a 3 digit number then star. This didn't work. Talked to him further until I said I was done. He had the new number, I was too frustrated to talk any further.A week later a got a letter stating my service was soon to be discounted. I called again.This time I think it was resolved.

Another puzzling thing, is that my desktop can get to the Internet by Microsoft Edge but not by Google. When I try to get into Google, it says I do not have Internet. I\u2019m open to suggestions as to how to correct these two issues. Thank you."

Ironically, he wasn't afraid to ask me for a tip when he was finished installing. I mentioned about the exposed wire to a gal from Hughes. She said that Hughes would come do it at a cost. I think the buried cable should have been part of the original installation. Other than the exposed wire, I would have given Hughes five stars. Gerald Harpt N3231 River Drive 49893"
