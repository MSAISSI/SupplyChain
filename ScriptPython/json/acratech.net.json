          "Contenu": "I ordered a dji mini 2 on the 19th of March, I received tracking the same day however my address was not on the tracking and it also stated my drone was shipped on the 17th March. On the 24th March the tracking stated my drone had been delivered and signed for however I had not received anything. So I emailed arcatech drones to find out what the problem was. They responded pretty quickly and said the tracking was wrong and they would look into it for me and if needs be send another drone with the fastest shipping. Its now the 3rd April and I have sent 3 further emails and not had any response to any of them. It is obviously a scam company! I have contacted my credit card provider to let them know of the fraud. Worst of all it was for my sons birthday on the 1st April."

The lever clamp fully releases when opened.  It should only release so you can move the camera.  Not so the camera can fall out.Really badly designed product.  The LeoFoto I have is a much better designed product at less than half the cost.And throw in the customer service that doesn't respond."

There was a VAT to pay (perfectly normal) but delivery was not possible unless there was someone home. It would be easier to pay the VAT upon ordering so that the parcel can be delivered moreeasily. But it may not be possible for logistic resons."

It's 1.6 lbs. lighter than my old NPC ballhead and has more flexibility and nice  features I look forward to exploring.  I'm surprised Acratech does not recommend carrying a tripod and camera attached to the Acratech GP. Detaching the camera from the tripod ballhead  each time I change to a new nearby site doesn't seem practical.  My older Arca-Swiss plates appear to have edges that extend further into the receiving channel edges of the new GP. So I'll use the old release plates on the GP, continue to carry my camera on the tripod in the field and hope for the best. The much lighter Acratech now makes my camera rig a candidate for a weight loss ad. ."

          "Contenu": "Two weeks have passed since I received my GP Ball head with lever clamp andone week for 5\" lens plate.  With 5\" lens plate, I started o set up Nikon 70-200telephoto zoom and TC-17 EII teleconverter to take Landscape and several bird/s picture. Bird picture is new category for me with tis GP Ball head with gimbal feature.  During two weeks experimental practice, I have been workingfor routine setup and process. This is very important for trained efficiency . I dropped whole system from clamp system which broke lens food. I was lucky that I dropped it on floor carpet, not outdoor.  Damage to food was minor one,need bond repairing and D850 and telephoto lens are all OK.  I still need to work on Clamp lever, Main Control knob and Tension knob for best routine and tightness.  Need to confirm for each step as you work on it.  I also found someloose condition when you shake the system after I have tighten the system.  I also found that ball slide has some tendency on direction, but it might be a margnal and not a serious one.  A gimbal worked very well and easy to find to measure the balance center for free move with 5\" lens plate.  Only suggestion to report is to add scale dot or line to plate so that you can control the position on clamp system.  (I put several dot/s to the plate by marker for each lens to indicate the best weight balance)  I am enjoying it very much taking picture of bird/s visiting water fountain at backyard of my house.  After all these trial, I will go out to take outdoor scenery and wild life. This Ball Head is a big fun!"

Finally a solution for those long hikes where any and all weight is at a premium. Thank you Acratech! Jeff"

Set up w/ my leveling base is extremely accurate, This unit attached to a leveling base makes stitching pano's a breeze vs when I just used my ball-head.  Also, for all my other general landscapes images the pano head works flawlessly.  I opted to using the lever clamp vs the screw type for speed and preference.  I have a ball-head with a screw mount and that's is fine, but I personally prefer the lever clamp.  Lever clamp is super easy to adjust to your specific mount (mine is a RRS L bracket) and holds my DSLR perfectly.  With DSLR mounted I've had no slippage especially pointing camera either upward or downwards (very steady).  Again, extremely please with this product and looking forward to the many adventures that lay ahead."

Very solidly built and excellent controls.  My old Gitzo Rational 3 magnesium head weighed a ton.  The GXP ball head from Acratech weighs less than a pound.  Couple that with a 5 pound carbon fiber tripod, and the combo can't be beat.  Using an L-bracket on my Fujifilm GFX 50R, the quick release lever locks solidly and positively into place, reducing the time to move from horizontal to vertical shots by a huge factor.I'm very pleased."

You can even use different colors of tape so that if you have more than one camera/plate you can color code them.

Using the two together allows for precise and separate vertical and horizontal placement of the camera with a compact and lightweight set up.  So far, I have used the combination with a 5x7 and an 8x10 camera.  Once in place, I can use tilt, shift and other camera movements without camera displacement.  Also, the camera remains steady when inserting and removing film holders. And at some point I will try the panning movement actually to try some panoramic set ups. In the meantime, this is a great setup for backpack outdoor use with LF."

The beautiful, simple, well-executed design makes this pair ideal for my application. After using ball heads for many years, I have transitioned to panoramic and video heads for most of my general photography. The independent x- and y-axis movements makes framing and alignment so much easier compared to a ball head. The Leveling Base makes tripod setup painless by eliminating the hassle of adjusting legs to finesse a level pano platform. This unbelievably light-weight combo just screams \u201ctake me with you!\u201dA word of caution \u2014 there is ample drag adjustment, but these are not fluid-damped, or spring-loaded components. Set the drag properly, balance the load, and you are good to go. But for safety, keep a hand of the lens / camera rig as you loosen the vertical-axis clamp knob on the pano head. I lovin\u2019 the form, fit, and function of the Acratech products. Great mechanical engineering is an art in it\u2019s own right!"

This December I added a couple lens plates. The plates perfectly fit, as expected, but also, the service was exceptional, especially in this blame Covid for delays world we are living in. When a company readily communicates with their customers both through their website and more importantly by phone, and is able to process and ship within hours on even small orders, I believe they are a company worth supporting. The products are superior in quality and design and their customer service, at least in my contacts with them, have been what others should be. And supporting American manufacturing makes it even better."

You can accurately  adjust for single level panoramas or multi level panos. There are % adjustment markings for both horizontal and vertical adjustments. I have not yet had the opportunity to test this new system but I am sure it will help me get great results.When I compared Acratech to other systems, Acratech is much more compact but still has all of the functionality needed. In addition this head will support heavy long lenses, and accommodate normal photo shooting as well.A great all around solution and highly recommended."

I love the way my ball head was designed and how it handles my camera.  I photographed a SpaceX launch a couple of weeks ago and used my old head.  I was wondering why after just a few seconds exposure the stars were steaks. Then I realized the ball head was slowly dropping.  I received my new Acratech head and used it on the launch a couple of days ago.  I tightened the head but not too much force.  It held my heavy 400mm lens solid.  No slip, no movement.  I will never use another ball head except Acratech.  To me this next info makes a difference, they are made in good 'ol US of A!  As a Veteran, I love seeing high quality products made here at home.  I give them six stars."
