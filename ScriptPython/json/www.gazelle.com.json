They emailed me a shipping label which I printed of on Dec 12. On Dec 14th the device was mailed to them. I was provided with a tracking number showing my device was delivered to their warehouse in Processing Center 7213 Global Drive Zip 40258 in Louisville Ky. According to the post office they PICKED up my phone on Dec 16th 2023 at 2:55pm.  I waited to reach out by email on Dec 19th. They responded saying they have no record of my transaction. My transaction was cancelled after I mailed in my device. I provided imei number, talked to 2 people on different occasions to try to get my phone back. I provided them with all documentation of this transaction. No one has contacted me or really tried to help with located my device. This was an horrible experience and now I have no iPhone or no offer. Terribley disappointed."

          "Contenu": "I recently had an extremely disappointing experience with Gazelle. Their customer support felt completely scripted and unhelpful. Whenever I reached out with an issue, it seemed like they were more interested in persuading me to cancel my service rather than actually resolving the problem. This approach not only felt forceful but also left me with unresolved issues every time.Moreover, the pricing advertised by Gazelle was misleading. Initially, they lured me in with what appeared to be competitive prices. However, once I signed up, the reality was quite different. They even tried to entice me with a \"25% off if you cancel\" offer. But here's the catch: when I actually decided to cancel and use this offer, the final price I would of ended up paying was more than the original amount I was supposed to pay without the discount. This kind of bait-and-switch tactic is not only unethical but also a blatant disregard for honest business practices.In summary, my experience with Gazelle was far from satisfactory. Their customer support is ineffective and seems geared more towards getting rid of customers rather than helping them. The pricing strategy is deceptive, leading to higher costs than initially advertised. I would advise potential customers to be wary of their offers and customer service tactics."

          "Titre": "Horrible experience as a seller",
          "Contenu": "Similar to another poster I also had a horrible experience with them just now. Never ever try to sell to Gazelle.Despite reading several reviews over the internet, I still gave it a try because I had my 128GB iPhone11 in pristine condition. I thought they would appreciate the condition and will not lowball me. This device was originally bought with TMobile and eventually got it unlocked. As for the phone description on gazelle , I chose Unlocked and Flawless condition as it was always in an Otterbox case with screen protector. Other than battery down to 80%, there is nothing on this phone that would be different from a new iphone.That said, Gazelle initially offered $208 for the device which was already lower than about $275 it is going at Swappa, however I chose convenience so I took chances with Gazelle than selling privately. After the initial email of offer, I never got any emails. Neither when they received my device nor when they adjusted offer. I had to keep checking their website periodically to find out the status.Today upon checking the site I figured that they lowballed  the offer to $121 with a generic reason that \"We had adjusted the offer price because either this is not the same device you selected or it had too many scratches\".I took videos and pictures of the device before sending it in and I swear there is not even a single scratch on the device (not even a micro scratch if those are a thing).The device was perfectly unlocked as it was also used on AT&T and Verizon networks after initial TMobile network.Not sure what their real reason for lowballing is, but anyone who is on the fence like I was - wondering if they should send their device to Gazelle - Based on my own experience, I would strongly advise against it.You would be better off selling it yourself on other platforms or even donating it to someone, than getting such shameful offer from them for a pristine device that even I was truly surprised after I took the case off... it was in such mint condition.I declined the offer and asked for my device back.. Another mistake I made was to send the device in the original iPhone Box and now they are saying they will not be sending the box back as they recycled it.Such a big mistake I made.. but then they say.. you only learn from your mistakes.. what a waste of time and energy...more hassles that I wanted to save myself initially from selling privately.I only hope that they send the device in the condition that they received. Only time will tell."

It took them a week for inspection, and they claimed my phone was locked to a company and decreased the price by over $200. I purchased it through Google Fi and it is fully unlocked. The info can even be found on official Google website. So they are claiming that Google lies? Because Google doesn't! I was abroad and could use my phone with any other sim cards of different carriers! So I requested reinpsection, which took over a week. Management and claim department NEVER responded to my claim and explanation / proof that my phone is unlocked. After over a week they sent me the exact same inspection email like before. I declined the offer and am waiting for them to send it back and give me a tracking number. So far haven't heard anything! My phone has been held hostage for 3 weeks since it was delivered to them and is losing its value. Again, save yourself time and energy and don't deal with them. Customer service hasn't been helpful at all! They're doing shady business and there are many other more trustworthy companies that are much more customer friendly!!!"

On the screen I didn\u2019t see any noticeable scratches. From other reviews I have read this has been happening with many users of Gazelle. Previously, they had been a trusted company to do business with. I and my family have sold several items with good outcomes. However they seem to have done a bait and switch to many people. I wouldn\u2019t trust them to give you a fair price after telling you they would."

THUMBS DOWN FOR GAZELLE **ORIGINAL REVIEW**I ordered a device in \"Good\" condition and received a device with multiple scratches and dings and low battery health. I would rate the device received as \"fair\" condition but it was sold as \"Good Condition - B quality\". They refused to issue a partial refund of $90, which is the price difference between a device in \"Fair\" condition and \"Good\" condition as listed on their website."

          "Contenu": "I did a trade-in of an iPad Pro 12.9 256GB Gray Wi-Fi Only in near perfect condition. Thinking I was protecting myself on the rare chance there was a mishap, I took photos of the front and back prior to packaging and sending off to Gazelle. Gazelle received my device soon thereafter (Nov 15 2023), assessed my trade-in as scratched in excess and they downgraded my valuation from $469 to $216. If the iPad I traded in is indeed now scratched, it was done after receiving the device by Gazelle.I used Gazelles packaging and followed their instructions. After learning of the downgrade in validation, I called (on Nov 15) provided photo evidence and asked for an escalation to re-examine, hoping they made an honest mistake. 3 weeks later and after many phone calls and unfulfilled promises, I hear the same thing every time I call: We dont have a status update, we are sending an email to the warehouse, you will receive an update directly from the warehouse in 2-3 days. I dont know if this is fraud, incompetence, or theft but I am out $469 on a trade-in of a perfectly good device. I really wish I would have taken what Apple offered, $400. Yes, I am pissed! I really wish I would have researched what I thought was a company with a stellar history. With very little hope Gazelle will actually re-examine my device and value it fairly (in line with its condition on trade-in as documented by the included photos), I now am in a state of disgust and feel like I probably lost $469 that I really could have put to good use this Christmas season.Hey Gazelle \u2014 look at the email I sent with pictures taken just seconds before placing the iPad securely in the box you sent me!!! Don\u2019t even dare respond and say it had scratches. The pictures tell a different story!!!"

A legitimate company would own up to their mistake and immediately swap out for the correct product. They would not put a customer in limbo by requiring them to shell out hundreds of dollars extra to get the product they ordered.

The carrier told me it is \"essentially stolen,\" and that Gazelle should refund, which they refuse to do because it was discovered after the 30 day refund window (true--but there was no way to know about the problem until I wanted to change carriers). They say they \u201ccan\u2019t override\u201d the refund window, which of course is not true. I can't believe I have been unknowingly carrying around an illegal, unpaid-for phone. This was a fraudulent transaction, and Gazelle refuses to make it right. A dishonest company. BUYERS BEWARE."

The claims agent, who had no interest in acknowledging any of the many warehouse mistakes other agents has explained over the phone begrudgingly promised a $50 payment given the situation, despite multiple reasonable appeals. He said this was (more than two times the payment due for the graded value). This raises three major issues. 1. Gazzele takes zero responsibility for their own internal problems and disorganization. 2. if the device in question was graded to be worth ~$25 (half of $50 offered) why did the inspectors recycle the device with a $0 value (downgrades seem to be a common tactic) 3. this agent, Michael never kept his word in issuing the promised payout amount, and the company has ignored many follow emails I have sent since that (poor) resolution was offered."

I never got an offer from them via email.  So after a couple weeks, I called customer service and got a really snarky guy that sounded Indian who treated me like I was a moron because I couldn't find an email I never got.  He also treated me like a moron because I didn't have the PS number handy but he never said, hey it's buried on the shipping label (which fortunately I'd scanned) where you'd never notice unless you know to look there.  Maybe it was obvious on the email BUT they never sent the email.I did have to contact customer service yet again, but to their credit, they emailed me (oh I guess my email does work fine after all) the code so I at least got the reduced payment."

But the second person was great and expedited shipping of the new iphone.  But now with this iphone 12, the battery isn't good and I will need to return/exchange it which is a hassle.  The battery started at an 86% Maximum Capacity and now it's already dropped to 84% after just 2 weeks of light use so I have to carry a charger everywhere I go because it discharges quickly.  So that is not good and I hope Gazelle will resolve it.  Thank you, Kristin"

Except the phone we received was still carrier-locked, which resulted in a month-long journey to get it replaced. Not all of this was in Gazelle's control, like the time it took USPS to get the phone returned. But because Gazelle doesn't have the option to \"replace,\" only to \"refund and buy another one\", we ultimately paid an extra $50 (and a month of waiting) to end up with the same phone we started with, this time not carrier locked to Cricket.Customer support was varied - at some points quite helpful, at others not as much, and often took many days for a response.Fwiw, this was our first negative experience with Gazelle after getting phones from them for five years, all the previous purchases had no issues."

What frustrated me is that they marked my order as complete, and I had not received my phone yet.  Gazelle should not be marking any orders as complete until the phone is in the customers hand even if the delay has to do with the post office, it seemed lazy to me. Thankfully USPS has been corporative and assisted me with all of my questions and concerns and should be receiving my phone today."

Once this is finalized, then I get a credit within 5 days to start the process all over again, of which I was offered no guarantee this couldn\u2019t happen again nor assurance a comparable device would be available once this whole process is done.

          "Contenu": "Gazelle offers good quality items at a variety of price points.  I have had good experiences with them, until I made a mistake: I bought an AT&T network locked iphone.  Apparently, Gazelle does not screen to make sure that network locked phones are eligible for unlock, for example that they are paid off.  In my case, my iPhone worked fine on an AT&T MVNO, but I was not able to activate it on a different network.  AT&T won't unlock the phone because it was not paid off.   Also, AT&T states they will refuse service to a locked phone if it is used by a different account holder from the original.  So in effect, I bought a phone that could be shut down at any time by AT&T, and can't be used on any other network.I think Gazelle should be more transparent about locked phones; they should either screen them and only sell paid off items, or they should warn you that a locked phone could be \"blacklisted\" by the carrier if it was not paid off.For unlocked phones, and tablets etc., Gazelle is a great way to shop."

          "Contenu": "I first bought an iPhone X from gazelle some years ago and had a great experience. I synced my phone with my computer and took it to the store to activate in place of the old phone, brand new battery, new charger, it worked right away. This time, the phone did not have current software and it alerted me to needing a download for days before I could do anything. Due to some problems with what may have been my home internet, it took days to download and get it installed. I was finally able to sync to my computer yesterday which was nearly two weeks after the arrival of the device. This time, I don\u2019t think the battery has been changed since there is a notice of battery health on the sticker. I\u2019m not sure why they didn\u2019t change the battery since that\u2019s the number one reason a phone would age out of use. This is incredibly annoying since it will have a shorter life than the previous phone I bought. Disappointed. Otherwise the phone appears to be in good repair and I hope it works."

I called customer support and then was guided to an available alternate phone. I had to request and wait on hold for a long time for expedited shipping to be approved. My order is arriving 12/11. Not the greatest experience. Will see what the phone is like. In the past, quality and customer service has been excellent.

In the past, I've spoken with Gazelle's customer service and received professional responses from people who knew how to help me. This time, however, the customer service was AWFUL!! With this most recent purchase, we had a simple issue with a SIM card. We called and spoke with several different representatives (all of whom were in a different country). The only response any of the service reps could give us was to return the phone for a full refund. That was the only solution they could offer. It was like talking to a bot.There was nothing wrong with the phone and we didn't want to repeat the purchase process all over again. The reps said that they could not connect us with a technical dept, a manager or anyone who could troubleshoot our problem.Thankfully, we figured out the solution on our own, but dealing with representatives who all read only one rehearsed sentence from the same script--no matter what the customer needs--was super frustrating. Gazelle needs to replace whatever customer service contractor they're using with reps who can actually offer customer service."

I was hoping to get this done before my summer vacation later this month, in about a week's time, which is why I went with Gazelle - I thought there wouldn't be an issue with the phone. That is, if I went elsewhere (for slightly less), I may not be able to get any issues resolved. So, there's that as a saving grace. But still ...

          "Contenu": "Dec 5, 2023: I'm updating this review from 1-star to 3-stars after customer service reach out to me after I posted my below review. We came to a compromise that made me about 80% satisfied, so I went with it. They purchased the phone from me for $564, which is still less than the original, but to save from the hassle of trying to deal with buyers on FbMarketplace or eBay, I accepted their compromise. Original post: Gazelle has predatory practices. I had an offer for $641 for my iPhone 13 Pro, and before I mailed it to them, I took at least 10 picture of the phone from all angles so that there couldn\u2019t be any dispute about its condition \u2013 zero scratches/smudges.  When I bought the phone it went straight from the box and into a case and never left it. So I shipped them the phone, and they dropped their offer down to $396. That is an insane $245 drop! I immediately declined that laughable \u201coffer\u201d, and requested that they send my phone back, and it better be exactly in the same condition as it was when I sent it to them. I feel extremely preyed upon by this experience, and I will NEVER do business with them again or recommend them. The practice of getting a person to relinquish their phone, all for them to bait and switch dramatically on the price should put them out of business.  Let\u2019s just say for the sake of argument that they considered the phone slightly lower quality than I do, the next level down for offer was around $615.Even though the company replied, I wouldn't consider doing business with them at all. Even if there was a minor discrepancy based on differences of opinion, in no reality is a $245 deduction warranted. Like I said, I took man pics of my phone at all angles before shipping it. I'm sure you all get away with this with a lot of people, but I am not one of them. I don't appreciate having my time wasted."

I reached out to customer service in multiple ways, multiple times and never received any response. Eventually, I bought another phone, but not the one I really wanted. I purchase an iphone 11 Pro instead after deciding I would give Gazelle one more chance. Luckily this one was in perfect condition and I am happy as a result. Gazelle gets three stars though, for not carrying over the $20 sign up discount and not upgrading a 15% off sale to the 20% off of my original purchase. A few years back, I received excellent service from Gazelle but not this time."

Nowhere does it say that you have to have the same billing and shipping address. So I did as she said and when I went to enter the promo code it said it had already been used.  I called back to see what I needed to do to be able to use the code.  She said it looked ok on her end. I explained that I had tried over and over and it wasn't working.  She eventually transferred me to a supervisor who told me they couldn't do anything. I spent a total of 42 minutes on the phone for them to tell me there is nothing they can do."

          "Contenu": "Buying inexpensive can be expensive - I bought my husband an iphone SE 2nd generation in last half of Sept. He is a very \"light user\" by any estimate. However, by this January, his battery no longer held a charge and would deplete overnight. The battery health field in \"Settings\" shows that the battery has a maximum capacity of only 83%! I wish I had checked this when we received the phone and believe it was probably low then. I called Gazelle, which said tough luck because we are outside the 30 day return window. I called Apple, which advised that the battery should be replaced once maximum capacity falls to 82%.  So while we got a great price from Gazelle, we now have to pay for a new battery, making our inexpensive purchase expensive. I had recommended Gazelle to a friend but would no longer do so and would not use them again.UPDATE:  Gazelle contacted me with an offer to refund the phone even though the 30-day window has expired.  I thanked them but advised that we already had paid for a new battery (at a cost of roughly $80) after they refused to accept the return. I offered to send the receipt if they would consider reimbursement. So at least Gazelle deserves credit for their outreach.  Waiting for a reply."

The phone did have some very minor issues out of the box (speakers covered in lint, old iOS installed), but I found them easy to address myself. Gazelle put support info in the box in case I needed it.

There was a billing issue that I addressed via the Contact Us page of Gazelle. While the issue was cleared up relatively quickly, I did not receive any confirmation from Gazelle that A) my message was received and would be looked at, and B) that the issue was corrected ie charges reversed on my credit card. I was only aware that the problem was solved by self-monitoring my own bank account. I don\u2019t even know if Gazelle had anything to do with correcting the issue or if my bank noticed the irregularity and corrected the problem on their end."

Then when they did ship it (not too long after but still) they didn\u2019t upgrade shipping for it so I still actually haven\u2019t even gotten the item yet. I ordered it with the intent of it being a gift and haven\u2019t gotten it in time. As far as business days I think I will get it by day 7 but I think they could have done better. I don\u2019t know what shape the phone will be in when I get it but hopefully it is as good as advertised. Honestly though I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll order again.

After being told it was on the way, I got another message saying it was backordered. I was going to cancel my order, but it shipped two days later. All in all the turnaround was less than a week. So, speedy delivery, and the product looks great and seems to work flawlessly. The delivery came usps, signature required, and arrived a day earlier than promised, which meant a trip to the post office to pick it up, but better than leaving it out to potentially get stolen. Bottom line: I would definitely purchase from Gazelle again, and have already recommended it to a couple of friends. Thanks Gazelle, for giving us a more sustainable way to purchase electronics!"

The only downside was that my phone had literally no charge and I had to wait to charge it, and that was after a rough night of going without a phone because my old phone died on me (as in, no longer functioned) while I was waiting for the new one to come. Other than needing to charge my phone, everything was very user-friendly and the directions in the box are very clear on what to do to get your device set up. Great work!"

          "Contenu": "I chose to sell my iPhone 14 to Gazelle because they offered me the best price and because I'd experienced great customer service from them in the past. I accepted their offer and received notice from the USPS that a package was on its way to me but received no notification from Gazelle. 3 days after the offer I received a prepaid shipping box for my phone but no notification from Gazelle. I called customer service and they verified the offer and that I could send the phone to them in the box provided. I received no notification once they received my phone so I called them. They verified receipt of my phone and I was told someone would contact me once my phone had been evaluated. After waiting 5-7 business days and receiving no contact, I called once again and was told a check had been mailed to me. I asked the amount of the check and was given a figure $15 above the initial quoted price. Two days after my call I actually received the check which was as I was told, $15 above my accepted offer!Very, very poor communication but Gazelle exceeded my quoted/accepted initial offer. From accepted offer to receipt of my check was around 16 days."
