So, if you include some 4-letter word, say goodbye to your account."

At first the communication was great and the support was also fast and good.After having send 33 email using SMTP2GO, I noticed the mail wasn't send. SMTP2GO suspended my acount because of 'unusual activity or an unusually high number of bounces or spam complaints'. We already noticed that there was a bot filling out form on one of our sites and we took appropriate measures. Keep in mind that we only send 33 mails using SMTP2GO. SMTP2GO didn't inform us by mail that they suspended the account (would have been the right way).I tried contacting support by chat but received a default reply and when I asked more questions about 'why', I kept receiving the same reply (not from a bot, but a real person). I send an email yesterday asking about the problems but didn't even get a reply!I think it's fairly indecent to react like this! I understand that if there's an abuse issue, that SMTP2GO has to do something to protect their own system. But you can communicatie with a customer in a decent way."

          "Contenu": "Our long journey is still going on to find a service that works for us after disastrous issues with SendGrid, First we spoke yesterday with a worker called Jennifer via chat, and we asked her that we are looking for a service that is better than SendGrid, and we told her that we have several problems with sending with this service and we are looking for an alternative and what will motivate us to subscribe to their service instead of subscribing to their services Bigger like Amazon SES, MailJet and MailGun, so she started explaining things to me like the speed of sending, but we all know that there are services that are faster than this service in sending, and she told me the price and lied about me saying that they are the cheapest companies that offer these services, but when i answered her that Amazon Ses Saved Us 100,000$ for $10 she avoided answering this question. Secondly, she told us that we should try the service, but after the first 10 emails, we found that our emails reach spam in Yahoo. We did not hesitate and asked them,And another worker called Louise answered us, and she told me I should send them a link from Mail-Tester with the same message and the result was 9.5 which is very good and that's where the discrepancy started, she told me the problem was that we didn't Verify the last CNAME And it's Link Track because we felt it was unsafe on our domain, and then she said something to us that we felt was stupid and she justified the spam because of our unsubcribe link, which we've been using since we set up the store through Shopify, so we took Our amazon aws account and we tried the Amazon Ses smtp to the same mail, the same message, and the same Unsubscribe link , And we did a test and it arrived in the inbox ( Yahoo ) And she started evading the answer again, which made us unsatisfied.Edit ( 15 Dec ) :I am really surprised by your response, what is your matter if we create an account using a number from a company or our private number, something else about our domain I explained to the worker Jennifer that we don't trust your service frankly, and we will not add our private domains within your service because your service not safe  . One more thing. We only sent 10 emails and complained about the problems we saw. Let's imagine if we hit 100,000 per month, that would really be disgusting. Let's talk a little about your website. It's really disgusting and embarrassing , Your site lacks many things, the first is the theme  of your website that attracts our attention and it's rubbish in blue. How can you compare your service that is not recognized internationally, recognized only in New Zealand, with huge services such as SendGrid, Amazon Ses, SparkPost, and PostMark.I am just a customer like other customers who have to criticize the services and tell the truth, if you don't accept criticism I advise you to close your service or just close your account from TrustPilot, this will be better.Edit 2 : This is really strange, how did you know that we are not interested , if we were not interested, we would not have created an account, and if we were not interested, why would we send emails through your service. Secondly, I must clarify something about the phone number. You are only Email Marketing service. What is Your Business if we use a phone number, whether we bought it online or not, add to this that we will not use the phone number in sending, but we will use the email as a sender and we will not need a phone number, and This is just an argument you made to cover up your bad things. We are interested in SMTP2GO , but we want a good service for us, not blue trash (you know what I'm talking about )Edit 3 : You really embarrassed yourselves, I read your TOS twice and didn't find any paragraph that talks about using a free or paid cell phone , or you hide some terms from your customers. I am waiting for your answer so that you blame this time on my name or my family's name because you didn't like it, you really embarrassed yourselves.really disgusting !"

I paid extra money (not a lot, but a few dollars) per month FOR YEARS before figuring it out. Now, is this my fault too? You bet.

I found SMTP2GO solved that issue, but it actually had so much more to offer, with statistics, bounce and spam reports. Plus, less messages were being blocked to legitimate addresses by the other email systems. My only wish is that SMTP2GO should have a complete email and webmail system, we would probably switch over in a heartbeat.  Only 4 stars, as user creation is time consuming for large numbers of addresses. And I wish the rates were only per message, and not with set blocks, as our sent emails fluctuate month to month with no consistency.Overall, I would recommend their product."

It is also priced very reasonably. Multiple accounts can be setup under your service to provide separate analytics for each device as well. All around, this is the best SMTP service I have seen out there. I give it a definite thumbs up."
