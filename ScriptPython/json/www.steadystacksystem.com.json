When most NFT projects were about profile pictures, Steady Stack offered utility as soon as the Discord group opened before anyone even minted.  Post-mint, the funds were used to invest back into the project and add a wide array of new value and utility for its members.To put it concisely, Steady Stack provides the education and resources to elevate your trading, investment, business, and life in general.  Perhaps the best way to convey the value of Steady Stack is through its community members' loyalty:The tokens that grant membership to this community have a market value of over $8000 (and some of them would probably sell for MUCH more than that).  Over 70% of these tokens are hard staked.  That means their owners could not sell them -- even if they wanted to -- until the end of the staking period. Many of these tokens are staked for ***3 YEARS.***  Most of that staking happened within a few hours after it became available. Some members of the community were asking for EVEN LONGER staking periods!If you are looking for a community that will help you level up, you have found it."

Other than the master class, weekly calls with amazing people like Beau and Zan you get a whole community that is interested in trading and willing to help. Alright after mint we started getting dope WL spots for other projects like TTOO and tykes and a few others.. they added dope tools for free to help titans like pocket universe for our safety and alpha sharks to help us too.All that I mentioned above and I still didn\u2019t cover everything because it would take a few pages to really say everything they did and are still doing. My point is, this is the best project in the space today."

I'm a third of the way through Zan's trading master class and it's continuous helping me become a better trader. I listen to all of Beau's weekly classes, follow the morning watch lists, day to day updates, and calls. There's so much utility in just the trading division not too mention all the other areas SS focuses on. Just started following crypto/nft calls from some of the other callers. There's so much to choose from, there's something for everyone. The community is so responsive and helpful, whenever I've had any questions in the past, the SS community is always happy to help out. Honestly Steady Stack is building something special and they have a holder in me forever."

Admittedly, I don't make use of a lot of the utility (e.g. around stock trading) but I have used some of the NFT calls with about 70% making a profit and the remaining 30% breaking even. i.e. I am yet to make a loss on any NFT calls.I was also looking at ways to prepare for the next bull market by learning better ways to research projects.

I believed in the vision they set out to create and they\u2019re accomplishing it and then some. I wanted to join because I felt lost on how to progress further in this space, and I wanted a killer group to run with. Everyone in this community serves each other. When I had questions about leverage trading and being brand new, 3-4 members immediately responded with help and info on dos and don\u2019ts. They walked me through the whole process. The outreach team is a beast, they put in so much work for us. Due to them, I\u2019ve been able to secure WLs to some of the best upcoming mints. The combination of teaching from Xan, Beau, Rippy, etc has been eye opening on what\u2019s possible with trading. But there really is something for anyone, whether it\u2019s real estate, mental fortitude, web3, content creation, etc. I really think Steady Stack is the best place anyone can be, bull or bear market. I\u2019m very grateful for the leaders and everyone in the community."

          "Contenu": "The sheer amount of education with these guys is worth the buy-in. The high hit rate of the swing-trade calls (generating over $1M in profits for holders) are worth the buy-in. The insane collab and WL giveaways are worth the buy-in.Noticing a trend here?This company truly sets itself apart from the other noise on the space. Out of 50+ projects I vetted, Steady Stack is one of two that has made it through the bear and the only one that has had a massive increase in floor price from mint(currently floating between 25-30x). I have been given more upward mobility opportunities(exclusive communities & job opps)within the space through Steady Stack than any other projects I'm involved with.Beyond the financial and professional aspect, I truly believe the lessons imparted by the Masterclasses have really changed how I view my limitations in my everyday life as well as the power I have over them and myself. I feel like multiple ball-and-chains have been removed from my hands and feet, and I can feel my strength(belief in myself) growing with each step I take. This is probably the most valuable piece I have taken away from Steady Stack to date.With current announcements leading into major growth catalysts, it's only a matter of time before this project becomes out of reach for the average investor. Get in NOW!"

          "Contenu": "Steady Stack is the real deal!I'm usually cautious with reviews but this first sentence is absolutely accurate and I fully stand behind this brand and their team.Whether you are a trader, investor or builder. Steady Stack gives you access to the best resources.I come from the web3 side of their business as I'm a holder of their NFT collection called \"Steady Stack Titans\".For people not familiar with NFTs the best I can describe it is that it's a verifiable digital collectible that grants you lifetime access to the Steady Stack ecosystem. And this is a huge deal.I paid 1k\u20ac in the past for a one-year subscription for a so-called \"Hot Stock Report\" where some stocks were analyzed and that was it. Now by holding a Steady Stack NFT, I have access to this and so much more. For Life!Web3 is all about community and building together.Zan, Hassan, Beau and all of the executive team have truly built the best community of all of web3 over the last 12 months.We are all like brothers and sisters constantly trying to improve and help each other and level up in life.I honestly have never experienced a more motivating digital environment than the Steady Stack ecosystem.As a beginner trader, I started to follow along with our goated trader Beau and made some great returns on stock picks. Now that I'm more advanced I want to follow his option calls where he's constantly dropping bangers. All transparently written down in a trading diary.This brings me to my next point.It's not only about trading but learning. E.g. Zan developed a trading masterclass that brings me up to speed so I can actually follow along with Beau.Titans get access to AI, Real Estate and many more masterclasses on a constant basis.And this is what makes the Titan NFT so valuable. The constant growth.I know it may sound completely crazy to you to buy an NFT. Or maybe you think it's a rug. And that's fine.But I hope I was able to give a little bit of an insight into why Steady Stack is different. And this accounts not only for the NFT but the entire company/ecosystem.If you come from the traditional web2 side you have the ability to get a taste of what Steady Stack is like by purchasing one of their courses.But if you are a growth-minded individual that wants to get far ahead in many aspects of your life I recommend starting to learn more about web3 and our community and ultimately becoming a part of it.I can promise you won't regret it!"
