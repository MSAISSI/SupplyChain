I just called tech support and got message that no one was available and I was out of luck.  They seem to have moved to wanting only online email support communications, but when I tried that, I got email back saying it didn't seem to them that I was olocked out of my program (which I am) and no way to discuss this.  I am now looking for another platform and recommend that you do not sign up for Therapy Notes.  Its a shame.  They were pretty good in the past."

There is no way to track denial claims to resubmit. It marks them as rejected and written off. As you may know you don't just write claims off when they are denied. Can't change anything on the note from an administrative perspective. ERA's are hit and miss they sometimes come via EHR and sometimes they don't. You can't communicate directly with change healthcare when you have EDI issues. If you are looking for a great software. Keep looking. TherapyNotes is not it."

Asking a counselor to redo 30 notes is not a solution. 6 months with TherapyNotes and no updates recommended have been implemented. The longer you are in TherapyNotes the more you realize it is a product for a very small operation. This product does not support any big practices without having extensive work arounds and having to manage spreadsheets outside of the system. In theory, the EMR system should help with this, but it does not. They promise great support, but don't provide any solutions."

I am an out-of-network provider, so I cannot speak for those in the network with insurance companies. My experience has been an exhausting one. Secondary insurer payments will not mark accounts as paid when Medicare is the primary; causing tedious, redundant, and time wasted constantly correcting numbers, write-offs, and entering patient copays.  It's been 5 months and Therapy Notes has cost me paying more overtime to billers than the fee itself.  I am looking for software with much more automation. I would advise you to wait 3-4 months to leave a review...the honeymoon phase is indeed wonderful; however, I found the basic accounting and billing functions inadequate and limited at best."

Almost a year later I found out that TherapyNotes had, in fact, never cancelled my account and had been charging me for a continued subscription for over a year! I contacted customer service and got the runaround about a refund but I decided to just cancel the service (again) to be done with it. I cancelled my account again with the help of customer service. A few months later I was alerted AGAIN that I had a past-due bill on my somehow still active account! After I closed my account twice! Once again I reached out to customer service and once again I was told lies (they told me I had submitted claims more than 18 months after I stopped using their system and I had to prove using their own activity logs that was a lie) and STILL have been unable to get a refund or cancel my account after months of back and forth with customer service. I would not recommend this software and would be very wary of even signing up to try it out because you may not be able to cancel!"

It has nothing about being pleased. If a company follows through with what they say they will do, and provide quality customer service, then they have no need to worry about negative reviews. Because of the service I received, I ended up going to another EHR. There were several reasons. There was no options for when text reminders could be sent out. Therapy notes claimed text reminders are sent out 28hrs before clients appt. My clients always received text reminders less than 24hrs before their appts. There was a discrepancy in my credit card bill which was always higher for services used than the actual bill I received. Fees for client's card used were never billed to the end of the billing period which was always shocking. I canceled with therapy notes and was still charged by the card service company for services that were not used. I tried calling the card company to cancel services, and the card service company told me I had to call therapy notes to get the service canceled. When I tried getting billing discrepancies resolved, the rep yelled at me. When I asked if there could be changes when the text reminders went out, I was told my business was small and insignificant. I was also told things were in the works to be changed, but I never saw any changes."

          "Contenu": "I am a Nurse Practitioner in a behavioral health clinic that is predominantly therapists. I am the only individual that prescribes medications. I really wish I could tweak templates for the psychiatry notes as I see fit--design my own so to speak. Have certain phrases and things built into every note, etc. Physicians/NPs/PAs notes are centered around a SOAP format, which TN does not follow at all. There are numerous areas for subjective content (ROS, symptom description) and then objective content would be the MSE, physical content, and objective content. Why is this all over the place? Assessment and plan generally go together, for instance:ASSESSMENT & PLAN:Major depressive disorder--Continue blah blah--Follow up in blah blahOur assessment is not better or worse than last visit. Our assessment is our diagnosis. There are so many random boxes to put in information--it is very clunky.Also please have it calculate the age at the top rather than just showing the birthday. Every other EMR shows DOB and the age such as \"2/2/18 6yo F\", etc. It is much quicker to see the age, especially with pediatrics where FDA indications of meds vary on age. Yes, I can do math, but when I have a patient every 20 minutes not doing mental math saves me a ton of time. Also we use A LOT more screening tools than the PHQ and GAD (at least I do). It would be amazing to have more of these included and also to be able to pull these into the note rather than having to type out PHQ 9 Score: X. Can we please get an auto-save feature?!? It is so annoying to have to scroll all the way down to the bottom to save. Again, when you are a very busy provider all of these extra scrolls, clicks, etc. which add time to your workflow and these getting rid of these little things helps so much!I have many more suggestions.I would love to work with TN and have them consult me to spruce up the psychiatry notes and make them more user friendly for the work that we do. Let me know who to contact to make this happen! :)"

I appreciate that they are trying to make the superbill function work the way it worked for years. However, if you read my comment above, I did call to get the workaround and it is NOT easy.

          "Contenu": "Our practice started using TherapyNotes in order to streamline our scheduling process - allowing clients to schedule their appointments online.  Although this is an improvement over back and forth emails for scheduling purposes, some very basic elements are missing.  When a client requests an appointment, it shows as pending for the clinician, but it doesn\u2019t send an email to that effect to the client.  Therefore, the client doesn\u2019t have a record of when they had requested an appointment, and they typically assume that the request submission guarantees that appointment time.  The clinician has the opportunity to accept or decline appointment requests, but clients are only notified about the accepted appointments.  When they are declined, the client is not notified. Clients can cancel appointments through the portal, which then notifies the clinician, but if a clinician cancels an appointment, again no notification is sent out to the client.  Unfortunately, TherapyNotes is set up to appear as if these processes  would be happening automatically, so many clinicians might not be aware of the lack of communication with clients.TherapyNotes Customer Support has been timely in replies to concerns, but has not been helpful.  Despite the relatively quick and straightforward programming adjustment necessary, each Customer Support response has dismissed my needs, saying that it may get looked at in the future."

While I won\u2019t speak for the agency as a whole, my observation is that the staff considers the application to be adequate but less than hoped for. My experience with TherapyNotes has been a bit more negative. Briefly, my disappointment is reflected in the following: First, it does not support couples or family counseling. This requires the clinician to document their couples/families and related sessions as if they are individuals. This works okay, but it\u2019s really quite limited in terms of writing notes about these clients. Second, it forces a workflow that may not reflect the clinician\u2019s preferred practice. In particular, a treatment plan with diagnosis is required before even the first progress note is written. It doesn\u2019t support well the initial assessment phase of therapy. In fact, TherapyNotes has no explicit way of identify what phase of therapy is taking place. It imports the diagnosis into progress notes (a practice that some clinicians and supervisors have found to be unnecessary). At this time, the diagnosis must be manually re-entered for termination notes (why?) . Finally, the folks at TherapyNote have very little interest in soliciting feedback from customers. To my knowledge, they have not requested input / feedback from our agency, and when I have given them feedback, it typically dismissed or ignored by their support staff. \r There are better products in the market place."

          "Contenu": "There are some major issues that business owners should be aware of. While the program itself is sleek, user friendly, intuitive, and encompassing. Some major issues include accounting inaccuracies. The most costly one for business owners is that any refund issued to a client, or a redacted payment by insurance, is only reflected on the actual date of service. So if you have already paid your therapist months ago for that session, and pull an income report for this current payperiod, in which you issued the refund, you will not find it. It gets deducted, on paper, from the therapists income at the date of service, not the date it was issued. So you can't easily deduct the refund back from the therapists pay using their accounting features. Another major issue is diffulty navigating the calendar if you are scheduling for many therapists at once. We have 12 therapist and there is no way for the system to identify regular openings on a therapists scheduled without looking at them one by one on a week view of multiple therapists on a day view but you still must scroll through week to week to make sure it is a consistent opening if you like to schedule that way. Our previous system would allow us to search slots by selecting AM, Afternoon, PM and Morning, Day, Evening and it would present all the options available like  \"12 upcoming slots on wed. at 9AM with Sam, for example. This one is extremely cumbersome when locating slots. We made several attempts at working with TN to resolve these issues but after over a year they are still not even in the queue. They roll out lots of little stuff but the big things don't seem to ever make the list. If you are a serious business owner consider that these things may cost you considerable time and money in the long run."

          "Contenu": "10/23/2020 Original 1 Star review.  We have had some really good experiences with TherapyNotes and some awful experiences as well.  From outages to technical issues to getting the runaround from support.  Customer Support's very typical reply is that a feature is in the works and that they can move our request up to development.  NONE of our requests have been met with any kind of new feature in years and some of this stuff is pretty simple.  For example, STOP HAVING THE DEFAULT AT PAYMENT BE THAT THE CREDIT CARD IS SAVED!  The default should be nothing so that the receptionist doesn't accidentally save information the client does not want saved.  I understand larger issues, like fillable intake forms that the clinician can tailor to the clinician's practice, are more difficult and in-depth.  Truly that's more than I could work out, but we've been in a pandemic for the last 9 months and I just got totally blown off by support about streamlining the intake process.  His response was, \"I don't know how to respond to that.\" and \"There is no way to put you in contact with the development team.\"  We have been with TN since March of '17 and I'm shopping for new practice management software for the rest of the day.10/24/2020 Amended to 2 stars.  Yesterday the above gentleman's supervisor called me and we discussed the issues I am having.  Firstly, the folks at TherapyNotes are very nice people and there is nothing personal that has been offensive.  Also, not all customers can be made happy.  They have offered to give us two free months of service.  That's nice but there are still issues that we would like addressed and the feedback is typically a, \"We'll push this along to the development team.\"  With that said, TN is working on paperless, online intakes.  That's awesome, also super late to the game.  There is a workaround, which I have not investigated yet.  My opinion is, stop it with the workarounds and integrate solutions directly into the platform.  TherapyNotes is great for a lot of practices.  Ours is unique.  If the issues above can be addressed, we'll stay.  If not, I'm still shopping.  Finally, it is super disappointing that it took a one-star review to actually get TN's attention and motivate them to reach out to a long-standing customer."

I lost information many times on complex multifaceted treatment plans, intakes and notes, because I did not remember every time to save everything, no matter what, or I will lose every bit of work I've done on that document.

Individual clinicians cannot see the entire payment record and must get a administrator to print the payment file. There appears to be no plans to make this available. 2. For practices that pay their clinicians as a percentage of gross a significant problem exist. If a client pays in advance each payment must be reworked during each pay period until the prepayment is completed. If this is not done the revenue generated does not show up in the revenue report which is necessary for the clinician to be adequately paid. The system necessary to manage this is prone to error on the part of the person doing the recalculations as they are done manually.3. Individual clinicians cannot run a revenue report for the income that they generate. This prevents them from checking accuracy of postings for the pay period. 4. The revenue report does not clearly identify the amount posted for that pay period. Each line item needs to be researched to identify the amount posted. 5. There is no total listed on the revenue report."

I was very happy with TherapyNotes up to that point and would not have switched before the need to provide telehealth services.So why only 3 stars? The reason is that TherapyNotes, when informed that we were moving, had no method to easily allow me to copy or download my files en-masse. You can download records, but only for one client at a time. A very slow and unnecessary process when you have many clients on their system. So far I have not been able to finish this process in 9 months. That is on me. I could choose to spend hours and hours and likely days doing it. My schedule has not made this easy, or reasonable.My new provider has a very simple feature that allows you to download all of your data via their website. No need to contact anyone. [UPDATE: Therapynotes called me the day after I posted this review. They informed me that they have a storage service that decreases the cost of having your data on their servers to $9 dollars a month. This is better, but still not enough. I was told they are working on a way to download data all at once which would be greatly appreciated. Therapynotes has great customer service. You can always get support on the phone. If the download issue is not a concern for you, Therapynotes is a great company and their system is simple and complete.]"

          "Contenu": "My group has been using TherapyNotes for over 4 years. For the first 3 years we were very pleased with the service. However, for the past year there have been significant reliability problems with their system. We went nearly a week last year when the entire system was down. Since then there have been too many outages to count. On a regular basis the system will be down for periods of time that make it impossible to use when you have clients, need to schedule, need to bill, etc. Anytime inquiries are made regarding details on these repeated problems the canned response is simply that they are aware of the problem and appreciate our patience. They are poor at giving information about outages, timelines, and plans to ensure they stop. We have run out of patience and are moving to another system. While I am sure I don't understand what it takes to make their system work seamlessly, its reliability problems have created such significant issues for us that we just can't rely on it anymore. Maybe the other reviewers can live with this, but, we have a large group and rely on consistent access - which this doesn't provide.The TherapyNotes CEO reached out to me directly which was good customer service. He promised things will be much better. They have been for the past few weeks. I am waiting a few more months before we decide if we will move - but the system has to be more reliable and needs major improvements with the patient portal onboarding. For now my review stands as is - but - may improve if things improve."

          "Contenu": "When I first signed up, I had to pay for an extra account simply to have my supervisor sign my notes, even though he does not use TherapyNotes for any of his own documentation purposes. I was offered a discount but I still thought it was silly that I had to pay for a subscription that was being used only for signing purposes. After writing this review, I was given a free subscription for my supervisor, which is greatly appreciated. If you are a resident or need your notes signed, be sure to contact TherapyNotes directly to inquire about pricing for your individual needs. \r TherapyNotes is also lacking in some basic features that would be nice, like a to do list that is not associated with appointments, a way to control who shows up on your active client list, and a session counter. Also, I once selected a setting to not automatically cancel appointments when a vacation is scheduled and now I can't find a way to change this. [Update: TherapyNotes's reply helped me address that]. Additionally, as a psychologist resident it would be awesome if there was a way to look at summaries of my scheduled hours doing various tasks. I also wish that they didn't require you to use the gender binary for patient information. Additionally, I find it annoying that if you start a note, but don't finish it, it shows up twice on your to do list. I've run into some difficulty with entering payments where if I don't do it just so, it will assign the person credits instead of taking it off the balance. This seems to happen when I enter the payment via the scheduled appointment box versus going into patient billing. Generally, I'd like to see more options for customization and to have them take things up a notch in terms of reducing glitches and improving features."

They answer in polite manner and resolve most issues satisfactorily. There are however, i in the past, where I have called and been waiting extensively on hold. No idea when someone will pick up. When someone picks up, as I said prior, the issue is generally resolved satisfactorily. However, I have inquired multiple times over the 12 months and the excuse is too often indicating they hire people and their training takes several weeks. That may be true, but then perhaps more individuals need to be hired to avoid these extensive hold times for customer service."

Sure they have improvements to make but so does everyone and you can't beat great customer service with REAL people. They are always so helpful but today Captain Nicole lead my private practice to victory in resolving claims, insurance payments, and client balances. She was patient, kind, she laughed with us, and helped us solve our problems with efficiency and skill. Thank you so much Nicole...I know a leader when I encounter one and you my dear are a BORN LEADER!!!  Hence the name I crowned you...Captain Nicole! Blessings to you and TN for hiring great talent to support small private practice clinicians like myself."

I highly recommend if you need a mental health MNR as customer service responded within 45 minutes and provided thorough instructions."

That's too many steps.  They should be able to create an account and upload the paperwork on their own.  It doesn't need to be any more complicated than a Gmail account.  This would especially be helpful for a solo practitioner like me.  I want to spend more time doing therapy, not emailing back and forth about paperwork.  I don't even use the portal feature because of this.  The biggest plus is the instant insurance verification.  That saves me a ton of time not having to call the insurance companies to verify benefits."

It would be so helpful if the provided client information form included a place for insurance information and that transferred automatically to the client billing settings. Also, while the telehealth platform is very convenient and works well, I cannot then access client information or paperwork during the session.  It would be helpful, especially with the new screen sharing option, to be able to show clients how to upload forms or use the client portal and such.

I also appreciate being able to decline appointments.  There could be room for improvement there as they don't alert the client that the appointment was declined, you have to do that yourself but it's also easy to miss the message that lets you know that.Also setting up billing can be a tad bit confusing and a bit of a nuance but once it's done its all good.  There has been a big delay in receiving payment, but I believe that is on part of the insurance company.Video is pretty good and pretty easy to get to.  I have found though that the video will lag on occasion and act up.  It also appears to always say that internet connection is poor for both parties; I am not sure what that is about.  All in all I can say I do like the platform.  They have even made some small changes in the short period of time I've been on.Once thing I can say is stellar is the amount of support, they give you.  There are videos and helpful blogs everywhere, but they are also always reaching out to see if you need assistance with anything.  They call, email, and just reach out if they feel you need anything.  I think the platform is awesome and I am pleased with my decision."

          "Contenu": "I have been using TherapyNotes since 2016. It is an amazing tool and has greatly automated my practice.  Things I love:-Insurance Billing is a SNAP!  Two clicks and  the claim is filed! I love the fact that the claim only gets filed when the note is complete.  This can be a life saver if I am ever audited. -Customer Support is THE BEST!  And it is live by phone if you choose.-Treatment planning templates are clear and concise. It takes me 3 minutes to do a simplified treatment plan when I use Practice Planners.-The automatic to-do list is fantastic. It is all in one place and keeps me organized. Things that are needed:- A dedicated scheduling app that has direct access to the scheduling calendar.  Other EMR software packages have this.- The ability to create online forms that can be filled out directly from the patient portal. The signature application is good but I want to be able to use my therapy contract and intake. Right now I email, print, and scan.- An attached HIPPA compliant email system that opens when the client email is clicked. You could partner with someone for this and add the subscription price as an extra. -Online therapy portal that is HIPPA compliant.  I use another application for this and it is working great but it would be nice to have it all in one place."

          "Contenu": "I have been really satisfied with TherapyNotes. I am a single practice provider so I wanted something which was easy to use for myself and my patients. With the big key items of wanting the software to be reliable, not regularly having connection issues on me, and user friendly. That has been met. I have used other complex EHR systems and it does not help with efficiency.Connection and Access Issues: Minimal to none. I have to think hard to remember a time I had problems. I do remember when there were issues it was resolved quickly in no longer than 60 minutes. Access to Support: Amazing! This is one of TherapyNotes greatest assets. They have real time support and you get someone quickly. Meaning 5-10 minutes quickly! For those in private practice this is like gold for your time. Additionally that are great for getting things resolved with the support. Clinician Features: You can do documentation, scheduling, billing, and tracking of tasks all in one. The system is not complex which I like. If you want very detailed options for intake, treatment plans, and client notes this may not be for you. If you like the set up of SOAP note format you will be happy with the notes template. I do not use the billing system to submit to third party payers so I can not give feedback on it. My one compliant is I wish I could get more of my own personal documents to upload to the client portal for clients to fill out for their intake. Additionally I like to give patients questionnaires to fill out. Being totally electronic with COVID-19 did not allow this. Patient Features: They are able to obtain portal access and the set up is easy from what I hear. The portal is nice since clients can request appointments, view and e sign documents."

          "Contenu": "\"Our practices would prefer to manage the relationship with their clients.\"This client would prefer to manage her own financial information on your site herself and does not care what a practice may prefer!  I don't understand why this is so hard for you to understand.  Your site stores the financial information.  You are responsible for it.  I highly doubt you are able to secure the data given the recent SolarWinds breech.  I doubt you even know if your site is hosted by a compromised cloud provider.\"We do have some ideas to add a feature allowing patients to enter one-off payments on the portal that doesn't require a card to be stored for future charges. But there is no way for you to push cash into a digital portal that I can think of. We are considering adding eChecks features in the future.\"This is a great idea!  I understand you cannot take cash.Per TrustPilots website, \"Trustpilot is here to help you shape and improve the world. We do it by giving you a powerful, open-to-all review platform where you can share and discover experiences, and connect with businesses to help them improve.\"  Note TrustPilot states open-to-all.I'm sorry you feel the review is unfair.  I believe that not giving any support or consideration to the ultimate consumer of your product, the consumer who pays your bills, is also unfair.  Your phone agents will not support patients leaving me no choice but to get your attention via a public forum.I am a patient but that does not change my concern.  I have since found out that a patient has no control over their own credit card (cannot change or delete) information once entered.  The only was to change or delete is to ask the clinician to allow it.  Legitimate medical portals do allow the patient to control their information.Let me know how to reach out to you directly per your response to my original review and I will be happy to discuss with you.  TherapyNotes should provide a way for clients to pay with check or cash as well as authorize all credit card transactions individually.  Holding a client credit card with an agreement that the therapist can charge with no notice invites abuse.  Not allowing payment by cash or check is a discriminatory practice which is becoming outlawed in some states."

          "Titre": "I'm very satisfied",
          "Contenu": "I am in solo private practice and I wanted to go paperless.  I looked pretty carefully at several different software options (made a spreadsheet to compare, did free trials) and even though TN was at the top of my budget I decided it was the best value for the things that were important to me.  Here's why I chose TN:\r--I wanted a reputable company that was well-established and trustworthy\r--I wanted one program for all of the following: scheduling appointments, writing client notes, uploading client documents, keeping a credit card on file, keeping track of payments, filing insurance claims with BCBS, and automatic appointment reminders sent to clients by email and text.\rTN was recommended to me by a friend and I've been using for 6 months now.  Here are some reasons I have grown to love it:\r--Calendar - syncs with my iphone and gmail calendar but only uses client initials, so onlookers can't see patient names\r--Notes - Intake note, progress notes, contact notes, treatment plan are all structured in a way that matches really well with the information I collect and how I like to write it up.  Check boxes for interventions make it easy to document what you did in treatment.  Everything is linked to the client's treatment plan and it prompts you to update the plan if the client completes goals or if the diagnosis is changed.   \r--To Do list tells me which notes still need to be done.  You can add reminders to yourself within each client record, and I recently asked TN to add a feature so I can put overall To Do items on my list and they said yes, it's coming.\r--Insurance claims - after trying to file paper claims and being rejected a million times I was shocked (with delight) the first time I filed an electronic claim with TN and it went through without a problem.  I've now filed claims for 4 different clients with different BCBS plans and they get paid the first time around.  This is probably the most valuable thing to me right now!  It's also really easy to track what is submitted and then enter payment when the check arrives.  There is no separate Clearinghouse - it is all integrated.\r--Customer support - Any time I have a question or need help with something, the TN support staff are prompt and friendly.  I've gotten things resolved very quickly.\r--Credit Cards - This is huge.  I was using the Square but it meant I had to keep a copy of the credit card number on file.  With the new CC feature I enter the card and it gets encoded and is kept secure and then I just click to charge it.  I love that it is integrated into the software.  Also, you don't need a card reader.  I was deterred at first because I didn't want to spend $60 on a card swiper but I realized you can just enter the number the first time and then it is saved and you don't do anything else.  Seems like the most secure option I could find.\r--Revenue reports - I am not a financial/Excel person and I find the reports on TN to be very easy to understand, and helpful to see how much money I am making. \r--Uploading documents - One you have uploaded documents you can open them and they appear in a new tab without being downloaded.  This is nice because then you don't have to go back and clear downloads from your browser or delete from your download folder and then empty trash.  Keeps confidential info off your actual computer.    \rThe only cons for me are:\r--Price - Value or not, it's a lot of money over the course of a year.\r--Contact note revisions - For email exchanges with clients I like to create a contact note for the first email I send, and then it would be nice to be able to add to that same note the way you would see a 'thread' on a message board.  The way it is now you can't group the different contacts together.  If you revise the note you can't tell the differents dates of each contact unless you add them into the text or go through the revision history.\r--Couples - There is not a great way to handle records for couples clients.  I use one partner as the primary client and then add the other partner as a contact, but then I am not able to add a separate intake for each partner.  If you make them two separate clients you can't scehdule them both for an appointment together.  If you see a lot of couples this is something you should evaluate carefully."

The wait time is incredibly long and the people who answer are rude or unable to help.  Today, I had occasion to need help with Therapynotes and as has been my experience in the past, I did not have a long wait time, they were knowledeable, patient and eager to help.  I don't dread calling support at TherapyNotes!  You guys are awsome!!!!"

She has been incredibly patient and kind as she helped me resolve some billing issues. She is extremely knowledgeable and in no time had my questions answered and issues resolved. I am new to running my own practice, and Irina and the rest of their support team has honestly been my lifeline while I learn this process. Without fail, I get a friendly helpful voice ANYTIME I need immediate assistance. (And I\u2019ve called too many times) They make it so easy, and walk me through everything step by step. They have even been patient when I ask a zillion questions! I would without a doubt be completely lost without their support! Way to go Therapy Notes!"

Therapy Notes and all their staff you Rock!!! I always recommend your services to my friends on this field."
