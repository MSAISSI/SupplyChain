They take a very long time to respond to messages. As a result, the loss of several hours of time and nerve cells. The phone is not topped up. I return to the proven service ding.com. Although there are slightly higher rates, it works without failures, topping up is instant.PS I don't know what your payment gateway requires, I haven't received any messages. Your answer in Trust Pilot looks nonsensical. I repeat: how can you demand information from a client without telling him what information you are interested in? Do not make a fool of the client. And don't write stupid and useless replies. You write that you are ready to help me. How? Can you top up my phone by refunding instead? What is your help? This is your useless reply."

NOTHING!!!Then emailed for more help they asked for another 160 euro. This is a ponzi. They will keep asking for more and more money. They take forever and not refunding. Complete scam to suck you dry of money.UPDATE: Refunded finally both parts. They should really pay attention to orders and not require customers to follow up. In my case i searched ATT official unlock and that worked in 5 minutes for FREE. This service just seems like its trying to make a buck off of unexpecting people."

You pay all this money upfront ($120). Then you go days without service due to carrier issues. For $120, I'd hope for a bit more \"instaneousness\", if you will. However, this is the process and DoctorSIM is no different then any other of these companies.I'll wait to see what happens.

I don't know if the additional 120 (or 145 for the service) would work but slapping on a 480% increase is dishonest and I don't trust them and would never have signed up if I knew this up front. I WAS able to get a refund, thus the 3 stars rather than one. THEY NEED TO BE UPFRONT WITH THE REAL COST.P.S.  love these hack corporate responses... I dare anyone to find the $145 fee to unlock your phone on the website. Went back in today to make sure I wasn't missing it and the only fee says \"From $2.95\" .. this is not too hard... just have a fee page and don't hide your pricing!"

For what I paid doctorSIM for just information, an unlocking SIM chip unlocked the phone, reporting it as AT&T, so not sure who to believe and what does it matter as long as the phone got unlocked, which was my main objective, so maybe save your money and just buy a SIM unlock chip instead if unlocking the phone is your main objective."

Great customer service.DoctorSIM responded to all of my emails within a day and also provided a refund in a timely manner (I had changed my mind the first time I was going to try them out and chickened out at the last minute to go with someone else...who ended up not coming even close to the services they suggested (OfficialiPhoneUnlock.co.uk)).It didn\u2019t work at first and then they gave me more detailed instructions that involved entering an emergency calling code to access the unlocking menu! Viola!! Only bummer was when we reset the phone it quit working again."

I have amended my star rating to show it wasn\u2019t all smooth sailing.I would like to recommend them but be aware communication is a little lacking and can lead to feeling of you not knowing how your order is getting along, also there is no contact number or direct link to get in touch with them to raise an concerns. On a positive note they responded to my original review quickly with a personalised email with the info I needed, why this couldn\u2019t of been done sooner I\u2019ll not sure.In short they get the job done but need to work on there communication."

After reading the terms and conditions, I begrudgingly decided to roll the dice as by this point I felt my only other option would be to buy a new phone. During the wait, I received several emails from them to say that my unlocking was in progress. The average wait time had passed and then on the 10th business day, within the guaranteed delivery time, they informed me that my phone had been unlocked via Apple's server. Fortunately, this meant that I didn't need to enter any unlocking codes, merely to restart my phone with a previously unaccepted sim. While this all worked out and I've had no problems since, I can't help but feel that it never should have taken as long as it did and that I didn't receive my unlocking earlier simply because I paid for their regular service. Nonetheless, in an industry rife with complete scammers, at least this company delivered."

Surprisingly, no unlocking code was required, as the unlocking procedure was completed directly through the Apple system. Furthermore, the team at DoctorSIM was commendably prompt in its responses to my email inquiries.However, my appraisal of their service must be tempered with a slight reservation. While the 5 business days duration was upheld, it still proved to be a somewhat protracted interval, especially when one is in dire need of their mobile device. Consequently, I would regrettably be compelled to bestow a rating of 4 stars, as opposed to the perfect rating of 5 stars."
