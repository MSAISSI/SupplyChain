I requested in the special request section of the order that they would make sure that the battery I was ordering was a direct fit replacement for the unit\u2018s. I received  two 12V 11AH batteries. The batteries inside the power packs were 12V 26AH. A huge difference! When I contacted customer service, I was told that I could return the batteries, but I would have to pay for shipping. The return shipping would cost me over 1/3 of the value of the entire order. They also stated that they did not have a battery that was a direct fit replacement. Which is what I asked for! What a scam! I will never order from this dishonest company again. Be careful. Don\u2019t risk losing money with Raion. Apparently, they have no idea what they\u2019re doing, can\u2019t follow simple instructions, and accept no responsibility for their incorrect actions. That\u2019s just bad business! There are far too many companies selling batteries to risk getting it wrong with Raion."

After waiting a week I decided to just contact PayPal to get a refund. After an entire extra week I finally got a response to my original message asking that I send the battery back. They seemed to respond quickly enough at this point so I thought things were ok, but the moment I shipped the battery they stopped responding to me again.At the very least, PayPal ruled in my favor with my dispute, and I'm glad they did because it sure seems like Raion Group would've made off with my money if they hadn't. Thanks PayPal.---Update: In response to Raion Group's response, I will give a full timeline of the events on my side.July 3: I contacted Raion Group about the problem with my order through their own channels.July 11: Having heard no response from them, I initiated a dispute with PayPal.July 16: I receive a response from Raion Group through PayPal, but due to technical issues with PayPal, I am unable to view the response. I spend the next couple of days working with PayPal to resolve this, but to no avail.July 18: A PayPal support agent escalates the case without asking me - I recorded evidence and supplied this to PayPal, and through them, Raion Group. In addition to the escalation, the PayPal support agent told me to wait on confirmation from PayPal before working with Raion Group on any sort of refund involving me returning the battery.July 19: I receive my first direct email response from Raion Group. Their email is directly in response to my original message to them on July 3. In this, they ask me to return the battery.July 25: PayPal asks me to work with Raion Group to try and resolve the issue, so I respond to their email from the 19th. We send several emails back and forth between the 25th and the 27th.July 27: I contact PayPal to let them know that I had reached an agreement with Raion Group where they said they would refund me if I returned the battery. I send over the email record of this and ship the battery out. Curiously, Raion Group does not follow up with me after I ship the package.July 31: Raion Group receives the battery at 3:34pm. They do not contact me to let me know or otherwise follow up on the situation.August 1: I follow up with Raion Group to ask about the situation, but receive no response.August 2: PayPal closes the dispute in my favor, giving me my refund. At that point I have still heard nothing back from Raion Group so I leave my review here. Less than 30 minutes after my review goes up, I receive an email response from them referencing my review, and then shortly thereafter they respond to my review directly on here.And now here I am, giving the exact timeline of events that I have in front of me."

Customers complains are just being ignored. They did that with other people, too, on ebay. Read the negative reviews on ebay. I am not the only one having trouble with these batteries and this company."

          "Contenu": "I bought 2 sets of batteries.  The first set arrived postage due, $53 -- almost as much as the batteries.  I refused per their advice, and ordered a 2nd set, as I needed them quickly.  When they got the first set back, they failed to refund me the price for about a week, and only refunded me after reminding them I hadn't received it yet.  But worse....The second set of batteries on my production UPS didn't even last a month.  Thank goodness completely failed on day 30.  Luckily, I was still in the 30 day return window.  Complete waste of time, worthless.  Put my network and data at risk.  You get what you pay for.  Looking for a better, more reliable battery option -- this isn't it.In response to the comment below: I have provided the order number to Raion, and I submitted proof to Trust Pilot after Raion challenged the authenticity of the review.  After providing the proof, they reinstated the original review.  After reinstatement, I have edited to add additional information, which is why it isn't showing as verified at the moment.Raion Group has an ebay store.  Look for \"RaionGroup\".  I did contact Raion Group's ebay customer service for resolution, and provided that info above.  It's the same company, same logo, same city, same battery, same customer service.The vendor they drop ship for is Raion Group, whom I purchased from.  I don't have issue with their service, I have issue with the quality of your battery provided by the Raion Group ebay store.  Check the ebay store.  Check their website.  Their response here is simply \"that's not us\" even though it's the same logo/city/website for both.  Step up, take ownership, stop dodging things via technicalities, which is now \"well, go complain on ebay.\"  I love when a company says \"Is there any way we can make this right/better\"?  Never received that once.  Taking ownership always impresses."
