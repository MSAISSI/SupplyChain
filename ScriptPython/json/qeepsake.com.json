I would rate this product 5 stars...My problem is, I can't order my book! Every time I try to order a book, their website crashes. I've tried multiple computers and browsers (safari, chrome, edge) without any luck. Communication is terrible! I can't get ahold of anyone! I've tried calling the only phone number I can find multiple times and left a voicemail message. I've submitted a help request more than once and no one has returned my calls or emails. I wonder if they are still in business? It is so frustrating!"

The pictures are very dark compared to the originals and are grainy. My originals are bright , vibrant, and clear. The ones in my $150 photo book are dark and fuzzy. Not vibrant at all. I'm no newbie to photo books. I have about 20 photo books created by mixbooks. They are beautiful and bright. There is also way too much white space on the pages of these books. Love the idea but you've got to work on your printing quality."

The books are a bit pricey and Shutterfly has better layouts. Also, it's terrible that you can't order a book with ALL your kids memories (you can mark every memory for every kid, but that seems to lose the point); I guess it's made for only children..."

I don't know if it's trying to avoid repeat questions from the first two pregnancies but this is a new pregnancy so there are new answers to those same questions. Like \"How did you find out your pregnant?\" or \"Are you going to find out the gender of the baby?\" or \"Will the new baby have any older siblings?\" I haven't gotten any of those. I'm thinking I'll just start writing journal entries with my own prompts because I don't like the questions it's giving me. Otherwise I like the app and the books it creates.

Often the words are large, but the pictures are small making it hard to see the details in the pictures. Where the words could be much smaller and still easily readable. I don\u2019t need a font 18/20 in order to read it. A font 11/12 is just fine. That is what is typical of most forms, etc\u2026. If this one things was fixed I would be 100% happy with the product."

(C) Editing/creating the book is a very difficult process and not user friendly.  (D) The recap email limits to only 10x posts within the email, regardless if there were more entries for that week.

I liked that I could go back easily to edit typos and content. It was easy to see during the editing process what the book was going to look like. The quality of the binding on the hardcover is excellent. The quality of the paper and clarity of the photos were excellent!The only thing keeping me from giving it a 5 star review is that I didn't have much control over the layout of the book. There were a couple of pages that printed with just a single question on it, and I would have preferred a better use of space for that page. I would also have preferred some options on cover color. I don't like that it's a white cover.I wish this product had been available when my kids were babies! I love it, and I'm very happy I can so easily record memories!"

What I do now is edit out full memories and I feel like that goes against all the hard work put in to writing the memory to begin with. Also, I know I can do a year in two books, volume 1 and volume 2, but that seems like too many books to keep up with if I stop when my kids are 18\u202636 books seems like a lot. 2. I would like to control when the Qeepsake recap email goes out. Sometimes I haven\u2019t entered any memories and then my family doesn\u2019t get any recap at all for a week."

They responded immediately, and with such compassion, it blew me away! They not only gave me access to her account, they gave me a free two week membership so that I could do a vinal edit and place the order (her membership had expired since her death), and they gave me a code to order two free books, one for her son and one for myself. I can't say enough positive things about Qeepsake, and Freddy Munoz, the rep I communicated with. The quality of both the hard cover and soft cover books is just beautiful and we will treasure these memories forever. Thank you Qeepsake!"

It\u2019s fun to see him enjoy and appreciate it with me. I can reduce the number of questions when I\u2019m behind or catch up on the app or website when I have more time. Now when people tell me \u201cyou should really write these things down\u201d I can say, I do!"

We love Qeepsake because our children wouldn\u2019t have any memory books with it out (or they wouldn\u2019t get made for another 20 years and by that time the little memories would have been forgotten). Every Sunday night, we do our Qeepsake entries for the week, mostly so the grandparents have something to see in the Monday morning email. We order one hard copy memory book a year. Although they are pricey, it\u2019s definitely worth having minimal time into the boom creation. Two things I wished: that it would save the old book orders for easy reordering and that there were a few more options for layouts that would fill out more of the page. We do a lot of collages. I like to create one entry that\u2019s like \u201cPhrases of the week\u201d now that we are talking a lot, there are a lot of funny phrases and questions that are fun to look back on."
