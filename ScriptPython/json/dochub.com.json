Using DocHub to write the answers to each question makes me feel like bashing my head through a wall, as every other line I try to draw disappears so DocHub can save every 0.2 picoseconds, just to have my drawing reappear as a tangled mess.   The fact that you have a \"Go Premium\" paid mode for a software that is created as horribly as this shows how little you actually care about your service compared to money. I'm surprised that Google recommends a service as horrible as this to edit PDF files, and I hope Google removes DocHub from their suggestions.   Also, to all of these reviews that are practically screaming, you're in the right place, but you're doing it wrong."

To open your file, you must grant DocHub unreasonable permissions to your Google files, which DocHub may share with anyone. Isn't ransoming data a crime?  How do they get away with this?  Conclusion: DON'T USE DOCHUB. If you ever use more than five DocHub files, you must pay. So in the long run, they extract money from you for the use of your own files. DocHub may offer some signing and drawing features but you can get those elsewhere for free without having your documnet held captive forever.  It's a scam."

The text boxes are so difficult to place in the spot where you want it, and will often just bug out and stop working all together, forcing me to finish writing with the pen tool, which is equally as frustrating as the text when it tends to disappear, reappear, and cause you to write things more than you should. The eraser only works half of the time, which is awful because the only other way to undo mistakes made by the pen or highlighter is by using the undo button, which ends up getting rid of half of your work. I've spent HOURS on assignments that should've only taken 10, maybe 15 minutes. I've screamed at my screen more in the past 3 months than I have in my life at this horrible excuse for a piece of software. Hair has been pulled out. Nails have been dug into skin.

Doc Hub keeps my clients information safe while allowing me to customize my documents as needed. Love the doc signing function. DocHub is a great investment. Oh, did I mention that I stopped bringing my laptop, or tablet to work. I only use my cell phone. I can do EVERYTHING from my cell phone. As a consultant and educator, DocHub is \"that tool\" we are all looking for. Thank you DocHub for supporting my passion."
