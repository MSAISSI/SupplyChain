I was not able to use my minutes that I'd paid for. A representative told me that a supervisor was going to call me back. I never received that call. I attempted to pay for the second month and the website would not take my PayPal payment. I called PayPal who said the company 800.com's website appeared to be caught in a loop of some sort and I should try a different browser. I tried a different browser and it still wouldn't work. I keep trying to pay it and the 800.com website won't accept my payment. Right now, when clients call my 800 number they get a busy signal."

Because these numbers are recycled, when dialing out from your line ensure the caller ID states your business number. Our number shows up as a random 10 letters and digits. The only way to rectify it is to call all phone providers (Rogers, Bell, Telus, etc.) and update your name. It's very time consuming."

Thank you, Anthony for your excellent customer service. What I appreciated most was that this representative listened to my concerns and was able to immediately identify with what we needed - this was a time sensitive issue, to help our business improve our customer service. Knowing the product and service inside out was key in addressing my concerns to quickly find a resolve too. The representative made a few recommendations after assessing the problem and then worked with me to do a test run of the all the changes. Like the ongoing support throughout the entire call and a willingness to help- \"let me try something else, let me look into something, is there anything else I can do for you, I want to make sure it works while I have you on the phone\". Appreciate the interaction, answered my questions/concerns and found the right product/service to resolve the problems as quickly as possible. This will help to increase call rates and conversion as we are starting our sales and marketing campaign.Thank you, for your customer support.Warmly,Sherryl Cole Griffiths, FounderPICKLE ME GREENCommercial and Residential Property Services"
