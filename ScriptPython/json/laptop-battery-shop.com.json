However, some significant issues: the battery was slightly too big, so putting all the screws in caused it to buckle, meaning I couldn't get the laptop shell back on, so I removed one screw. I also feel like it wasn't clear on purchase that the battery would be off-brand. Also, they've just asked me to write a good review for them with a link a different site, and offered to refund money if I do, so don't trust the ratings. Clearly an overseas outfit making knock-offs and playing fast and loose with rules/service, but you might get lucky."

I even paid the extra $15 shipping to get it here quicker.I received my package, only to find instead of a battery it was an exit sign in roughly the same dimensions written in Chinese.  I have written back twice to Laptop Battery Shop without hearing back from them.This has become a huge bottleneck for me, as my entire build has been put on hold until I can find a replacement battery.  Not sure how to move forward from here.  I just really need the battery.ordered:   Gigabyte 961TA002F, GMS-C60 11.1V 5440mAh  batteryOrder# 10032720Update:     I finally received a message after a week explaining that it was a week long holiday in China, and that they apologized for taking so long to respond to my inquiry.  They had also explained that they placed the battery inside the exit sign to help \"protect\" it from damage during shipping.     I did indeed find the battery inside, and once I installed it in my laptop it went from 15-20 minutes of battery life to 2-4 hours!  It was something I needed dearly, and worked just fine.     I was also asked several times to delete this post, that it was affecting their \"sales\" and was even offered a bribe to take it down.  I will do no such thing.  This is what is, and they will just have to acknowledge that this was a missed chance at communicating an important piece of information.  This has profoundly delayed my build by over a month, as timing is crucial for a busy professional as myself.  I did improve the rating to 3 stars, as the battery performed as expected."

The company does refund you $2 to write a positive review, so feel free to be wary of that. Other than that, a good company."

Couldn\u2019t log in and check order status. Various pages still have sample text from some sort of website template. Not very professional. I had to use a different card because the purchase came through as international. It would be nice if payments were processed in the country of purchase."

          "Contenu": "The overall experience was a mixed bag, which maybe expected from a Chinese company dealing with shipping sensitive (LiPo) batteries during this pandemic.My laptop battery had bulged, and the vendor was unable to ship the bare batteries to me and pointed me to site and the exact batteries to get.Site staff was very helpful by answering pre-sales questions about shipping and confirming the exact battery ordered before processing the order.I understand the pandemic has everything up in knots but it was still an odd just over 5days before they shipped my order out and provided me with like 3 different tracking numbers via 3 different shipping companies - the actual one was not named and a generic tracking site provided.The batteries arrived just around the estimated maximum of 15 (working) days, with tracking not making sense and not timely.When the batteries finally did arrive (it seems there's no local delivery anymore, had to contract anther local courier to finish the last mile, or go to pick it up) they were the exact batteries stickers and all :DThe batteries behaved exactly as the original ones did."

Their customer service is average, they respond usually within a 48-hour time frame, though it does sometimes take longer. Their tracking information is good but often late or lags behind their response email. Their products are great, both batteries work as they should and I haven't had any problems as of yet!

I definitely didn't mind how long shipping took, was a bit disappointed they didn't have an option for faster shipping but that's most likely due to the restrictions on batteries on flights."

So, they wrote back and suggested another battery with a lightly different model number, though it was identical to the one specified. I ordered it and within 2 weeks it arrived to my home in California. This battery was perfect and the people who e-mailed me were very kind and helpful.I am a very satisfied customer and now my laptop is back in working order with a brand new battery.The people from Laptop Battery Shop really came through."

I ordered a battery for my son's Huawei laptop that we bought for him about 3 years ago, and paid to have it expedited. Was I surprised when I received an email from Amy, one of their representatives, letting me know that the carrier they use to expedite their orders,was unstable and said that it would take longer to get to me. In her email she said that they would refund the expedited shipping cost I paid if I was willing to wait, or they would refund the entire cost of what I paid. I went with waiting, and the battery came within the time frame they stated. Their communication was COMPLETELY AMAZING! I would totally order from them again. Thanks Amy, for being such a nice person to deal with."

I found the 90 watt hour battery with the correct connector for my laptop on this website and it lasts much longer.w The price was reasonable and the shipping wasn't too bad I think it took about a week to come in. The folks that run this company are also very knowledgeable when it comes to batteries. They are also very kind and respectful. When I had an issue with a battery I bought they corrected it for me no questions asked. I would highly recommend using this site to order a battery if you need one or your friends or family need a replacement.
