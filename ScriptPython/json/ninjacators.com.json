As for Robot Lab I would not use this unless you are willing to loss your original purchase capitol and whatever cash you lose trading. They say they offer a money back guarantee but only if you trade with live cash for 90 days. Trading in Sim Mode does not count. So you will will need to risk losing money for 90 days before you can get your money back. Pretty shady. They only have bots that shoot for the moon with huge stops also. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Some of us call that luck. They have been saying they would be releasing new updated and additional bots next week. The problem is they have been saying that for several week now.Updating this as of 4/12/23I see they are now offering a new guarantee. 120 days of running in simulation mode now qualifies. This is good but unfortunately this is because of the uproar that is taking place with so many asking for their money back."

          "Titre": "Beware of the Support that You Get, or Don\u2019t Get, After You Purchase Indicators from Ninjacators",
          "Contenu": "I did not have a good customer support experience with Ninjacators when I had problems with one of their indicators.  It all started with them taking several days to just verify that I had purchased the product and was entitled to customer support.  Which was only resolved when I sent them a copy of my purchase receipt.  Next, I spent a few more days demonstrating that I had followed all of their instructions and installed the product correctly, (i.e., removing their ninjascript indicator, reinstalled it, etc\u2026) and still their product would not properly appear on my charts.  Then, it took a few more days for them to come up with a solution that I should just try uninstalling NinjaTrader 8 and reinstall it adding their indicator first to see if it would work.  Of course, that meant reinstalling every other indicator that I have and re-configuring all of my charts and settings, which would take me a few days to do correctly.  When I objected to doing that before exhausting every other support option, then I was offered the solution of having them look at my computer via remotely logging into it and trying to get their indicator to work.  The first available time slot for that was many more days away.  Finally, before I was able to have the remote help session, I received an email stating that they were closing the help ticket, because they \u201chadn\u2019t heard back yet\u201d from me.  Despite my many emails back and forth about the issue requesting customer support.  Somehow, they decided that helping me get their indicator to work on my computer was not going to happen, and they were through trying to support their product.  Moreover, many companies sell indicators for NinjaTrader 8, and what separates them is both the effectiveness of their products and the support that you receive when and if they do not work as described.  In this case, Ninjacators customer support failed to be effective, reliable, or helpful after purchasing their product.  As well, I was told that I can neither return or exchange it.  At this point, I just want to forget dealing with this company, and encourage you to carefully consider who you spend your hard earned money with, and what support that you may or may not get if anything goes wrong with their products."

          "Titre": "Unprofitable EMINI Predictive Trader",
          "Contenu": "I purchased the EMINI Predictive Trader offer on February 4, 2023 for $247.They stated repeatedly in the marketing that it was a great way to earn an extra $5000/month, and my logic was that I should at least be able to get a couple of decent trades out of it during testing to make back the purchase price.All the trades taken in the marketing promo were profitable.After I received access to the product I commenced back testing, only to discover that it produced just one single profitable trade in over a month...and that trade was only for a couple of ticks, or about $10 on a micro account, and you had to be fast to grab it.I tested it on multiple time frames and tick charts with the same results: loss after loss after loss.I also viewed the four so-called \"live\" trading videos provided in the training area.  During the first two videos not a single trade is taken, just a review of past potential trades. If you are an experienced trader, you know that such discussions taken with 20-20 hindsight are utterly useless In the next two videos a couple trades are taken, but one is taken after the fact without a proper signal (it had only two boxes as opposed to the three they state in the strategy), and the other one magically appears after a pause in the video.  It's for two lots, with the first one making a small profit and the second lot wiping it out with a bigger loss, which the presenter tries to gloss over by shutting things down quickly.So even their own training videos for the indicator are not profitable.It became obvious to me that, in my opinion, I had been scammed, so I asked for a refund.  They told me their policy is to exchange the indicator for one of equal or lesser value within 30 days.Customer Service Ninja Brent also told me to \"have a nice day,\" after taking a firm stance that no refunds would be given.Bottom Line:  This indicator is the worst one I have ever purchased.  In fact, it is so bad I am thinking of fading its signals to see if that can earn back my purchase price.As for the company, they seem perfectly happy to have a very dissatisfied customer sharing his experience with the world.You might want to ask yourself if that's the kind of company you want to purchase from.Hope this helps.Update: Feb 20, 2023I traded my indicator for the Power Micro Trader.  at first it looked like a vast improvement, with a very profitable trade on my sim account the first day (I wasn't ready to use real money on a new indicator).But the next day, every signal it gave was the exact opposite of profitable.  In other words, had I been attempting to lose money I would have maximized my losses by taking these signals.As much as I had high hopes for this company, it appears that their indicators simply do not work.  In fact, it can't be coincidence that both of the indicators I tried are not only NOT profitable, but will actually maximize losses on most trades.  This suggests indicators that rely on counter trend extremes...a very dangerous strategy for traders."

          "Titre": "Buyer Beware",
          "Contenu": "Buyer Beware Initial sales support is excellent. However, forget about meaningful timely support after the sale. Support after purchasing their products, even if your purchase is over $2000, comes long after you needed help. If you plan on buying their products, loading, watching the videos and start practicing and trading forget it for some of their products. You will always have something that is missing or not working 100%. It's been about 60 days since I purchased over $2K of Ninjacator products, and I'm still unsure if they are working properly.Also, pending which products purchased you sometimes use your order ID, while others you use a license, all of which is very difficult to obtain at first. You would think both would be on the purchase receipt or welcoming email, not in my case. It took 3 days and several emails to get them, and finally after the one and only one phone call I received after emailing I was going to call my Credit Card Company to ask for a refund.I'm day trader for 25 years making nearly 7 figures annually, professionally trained by retired 30+ year Floor Trader. I have spent nearly 6 figures over 3 decades on trading systems and indicators. Ninjacators rank in the bottom 20% due to weak customer service. The saddest part of this review is that I had planned to buy all of their products, but that seems highly unlikely at this point.They will eventually send you an email that usually gives common / standard IT support advise or questions. E.g. Like what version of Ninja Trader are you running. In one email \"after\" the $2000+ purchase I made, they made it clear that they usually do not provide installation support or technical phone support. So, be prepared to solve installation and technical issues through several emails or when your not trading. They generally take 24 to 48 hours to respond, but they will respond with questions that leads to questions and more questions, which could have been solved in a 3 minute phone conversation many times. However, if your response is not within 48 hours they close your support ticket saying that your problem has been fixed when it's not.  As I'm writing this review, I lowered the rating from 2 stars to 1 star.  Date of experiences has been weekly since February 2023 to present in trying to completely stan-up all the products I purchased. On a positive note, their Training Videos on how to use their products are great!  Some of the best I used.Their products have value and are useful, but are over sold / valued like 90% of most trading product vendors, so they are no different in that respect.Their products have no trading revelations, but have merits. Some products can be purchased at other vendors that have better support in my opinion. One final recommendation... Over the decades I have seen a pattern with Trading Vendors. If they do not offer a \"cash refund\" / moneyback guarantee after their trial period, there is good reason why... usually it\u2019s because something in their products or service does not add up. Ninjacators offers 30 days to try their products and if you don't like it, they will switch you to another unsupported or poorly supported product, but no refund, and if you're lucky to get the product stood up and running your 30 days most likely will have expired, so no switching to another product. Seem to be good people with good intentions, but grossly fall short for good paying customers. However, like I noted above, if a Vendor has great products and service they usually will have money-back refund policy. This is not the case. I have found reasonable use for a few of their products, while others are almost identical to standard indicators found in many charting services."

My experience with STL gets worse with each new version. There are numerous problems, which make the software almost unusable. I say almost, because you can still put it on a chart, but if you change things like time, or close it, the settings will be gone. It removes accounts from NT8 Control Box, to mention a few.This is only one of Ninjacators software programs, of which there are many other more good ones. Perhaps STL was released a little prematurely, and that needs addressing. What makes me uncomfortable, is the fact that this is still being promoted and sold to the public, when these issues are known, hence the 2 stars.This is not what I expected from Ninjacators, when I joined as a Lifetime member."

I recently purchased one after a long break, pulled in by the marketing. Not only was it a challenge to get two of the components working (first time that happened), but I couldn't reach anyone over email nor phone to help for over a day. Which is an eternity when you're trading, working, and a busy parent. And there are no returns, only exchanges. I ended up not using it in lieu of native indicators. Update:Thank you for your response. I appreciate it. I sent my original issue Friday morning at approximately 10 am CST, and called approximately 2 hours later. I definitely didn't expect anyone to reply over the weekend. I did get a response this morning and an exchange, which I very much appreciated. I've reverted back to native indicators, but will keep the new indicator on hand with the others for potential future use. Thank you again, and I appreciate your help."

I  bought an Elliott Wave Indicator for NinjaTrader from a other company, and paid $3000 for it. Then  I saw a special deal from Ninjacators, offering their Elliott wave Indicators for $497. I bought it. And I'm not surprised; Ninjacators Elliott Wave Indicator is sooooooo much bettter compared to the Elliott Wave Indicator I bought for 6 times the price elsewhere. I m a Ninjacators fan for life and can only recommend Ninjacators to anybody who is using the NinjaTrader platform."
