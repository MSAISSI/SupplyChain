Oh and day after I signed up, I was emailed the next day, I replied asking for assistance and never heard anything back. Don't waste your time, these \"positive\" reviews are fake as far as I am concerned the software is broken and their service is a shamblesEdit: No I will not be forced to waste my time any further because you simply don't like my review.

They assured me their service would work with my existing hardware and checked that my number was portable. They even offered me an excellent discount to purchase. I signed up for an annual plan and ported my number. During porting, I had to contact them because they emailed to say that the port failed. Then they said it hadn't and it was a mistake. The number seems to work, but I'm concerned. Then, I attempted to connect my phone. I followed all the steps in their process and got an error. I tried it several times. The onscreen instructions say to send your device's MAC address to support, so I did this and explained the problem. They sent me a copy/paste of the help document and process I'd just done 3 times.I wrote back to explain that I'd done this and was still getting an error. I received back a copy/paste of the help doc and the process I'd already followed. I called in, and they were going to escalate it to their technical team and respond via email. Guess what? I got a copy/paste of the help doc. Stay away from this company. They may be inexpensive, but if you ever need help with your service, you won't get it. Now, I'm trying to get my number ported back and hoping for a refund, but I expect it to be a fight."

Did you purposely ignore my request to cancel?

Then, when you contact the automated chatbot, nothing goes through there either. Good luck canceling! WOW! Chargeback city, baby. Switched to google voice and never, ever ever going back. I'm actually extremely disappointed because I'm one of the people that worked on the partnership with Google and I thought this product was better. They sold it for better than what it actually was. Google should sever ties, IMO. Would never have signed off on this partnership if I knew this was how the service actually was here."

I had to pay up just to be able to log into work. I wouldn't have minded so much if the page advertising the free trial had bothered mentioning the limits to the trial. But there was no mention of a daily minute limit. The only limit mentioned on the trial page is a 14 day limit for the trial period. I even looked in the terms of service and found no mention of a specific daily minute limit. They do reserve the right to cancel an account for any reason without warning, which they did to me when they noticed I was reaching an arbitrary limit that had not been disclosed to me at any point.

I had a positive experience with customer service for the most part and call quality was not really an issue, but the software they built, functionality, versality, flexibility, ingenuity is HORRIBLE. They should be embarrassed. There are basic features and functions that you would think they would have released in an early beta and yet their software has been around for quite awhile now and still lack these features. It's no wonder they're based out of California. Just like their state gov't they charge you more than anyone else and yet can't even deliver basic amenities or quality of life."

I've escalated this and no one will help. Clearly struggling with churn so they just make it impossible for you. We weren't even looking at moving away, we just wanted our account to be accurate to the seats and not overpay by double.

So I emailed support and typed out an explanation why I'm discontinuing their services (i.e. no longer invested in sales calls industry).Month 3 comes and I was charged again! So I went from forgetting to cancel my free trial to getting charged for 3 months (in addition to the time cost of sending 2 email requests to cancel.)Instead of emailing Dialpad a third time to request a cancellation, I saved time by contacting my bank to block future charges from Dialpad. This action would have saved me time and money after charge #1.Perhaps Dialpad intentionally makes it difficult to cancel subscription requests as part of their business strategy? It's much easier to unsubscribe from spam text messages with a simple reply such as: Stop"

A misunderstanding! Everything has to be some kind of insane conversation with these people. Then when u expose it, its just a misunderstanding!

The presence of hidden fees adds to the complications, making it financially burdensome. Communicating with their customer service is nothing short of a mockery. I endured a 30-minute wait on hold, only to be neglected by the agent, who failed to check in with me even once. When attempting to cancel our services, we were merely transferred to an answering machine, further exemplifying their lack of commitment to customer satisfaction.Their software proves to be plagued with significant issues, particularly for medium-sized contact centers. Multiple contacts with the same number can be created, resulting in chaotic and disorganized records. Merging these contacts is not an option, and there is no functionality to add a number to a Do Not Call (DNC) list. Furthermore, managing multiple contact centers becomes an arduous task due to the absence of a consolidated view, forcing users to navigate between multiple screens to access queues. Timekeeping for agents is also disorganized, with a messy system that requires additional upsells to another company, incurring an extra charge of $30 per seat. Real-time statistics per agent are inaccessible, as generating a report necessitates a 24-hour wait. The software's numerous flaws, such as these, contribute to daily frustrations and difficulties. It is evident that the software is being developed by individuals lacking firsthand experience in call center management."

          "Contenu": "Stay away if honesty matters to you! Their product is good which makes this writing this difficult but they are internal practices are highly questionable.Here\u2019s what happened to me. I had called inquiring about pricing as I was had questions and needed exact pricing. I had been burn in the past where online you see one price but when you sign up and get your invoice, it\u2019s substantially larger.In my case, they offer me an excellent price for a one user phone plan. I explained to the sales rep on the phone I was in the business start up phase and needed to account for all expenses. All I needed was basic phone features , couldn\u2019t care about the extras. I was very specific and asked what the total amount would be. I provided him my zip code for him to give me a total price to include taxes and fees. He quoted me $129 for the year which was a fantastic price and was slightly better than some other competitors I had been researching. That would of came out to about $11 monthly average for signing up for the yearly payment option.I said it sounds good, he even sent me the invoice on the spot for roughly $129 and I paid for it on my cell phone right then and there. After getting off the call, I noticed a charge for $227 a few hours later and was wondering if I had been double billed in error. Thinking it would resolve itself over night or even may be a temporary hold. Nope, I finally had to call. I called and they apologized, the lady said the extra amount, which came close to $100 was for fees.Fees? I specifically asked for a total that included fees and taxes. So I asked to cancel on the spot. They said that I should hear back soon. A week went by and nothing yet. Had to call again, this time the new rep was nice enough to actually cancel my account on the call. Not sure why you have to call twice to cancel an account. In my eyes, If a company can\u2019t be transparent upfront about pricing, it makes you wonder what else they would lie to you about.Anyways, after the headache from dialpad, I went with Zoom VOIP which advertised $15 monthly, no year up front required. Their monthly price with taxes and fees is $16.24Now that\u2019s the part that really gets me. How is Dailpad cheaper per month at around $11 but with their fees/taxes they average $18.92 ($227 / 12 months = 18.92)Where zoom is $15 and comes out to $16.24 Makes no sense as both are VOIP providers.All I got to say is shady practices, I would never recommend Dial pad to anyone I know.My recommendation to the company is that it\u2019s a shame they use these practices. The product is fantastic but the whole experience matters. Be transparent, honest, and fourth coming. That means more to me than anything else when I put an element of my business in your hands."

          "Titre": "worst experience dealing with an online service in 25 years",
          "Contenu": "I have been using Dialpad for ~ 15 months & although most of the support agents have been kind, responsive & helpful, both the service & their policies are not up to par, especially the service reps that handle unsatisfied customers. It appears I'm not alone, many others here agree.First, the service dropped my calls often (from the desktop app), normally about 3-4 times a month. Sometimes I could not call a number at all with no ringing after making a call or no ability to use an auto attendant (press any keys during the call). I had reported most all of those incidents to support & after 15 months, nothing was getting better or resolved. The iPhone app often would not allow me to place a call from my contact list, only if you hit the 'phone' icon in a specific area of the app (not on the contact's page) would the call initiate. The iPhone app would also lag in response, turning on or off the speaker, initiating the call or ending the call, all were delayed so often you would have to hit the icon/link several times to get it to work (or not work). The desktop app was also not stable even though I kept it updated. The VM transcriptions were wildly off.Then a few months ago I inquired about the charges and policies related to the new SMS/MMS registry. The rates on my service went up about $80 per year unannounced & the answer was 'taxes'. I spoke to customer service several times and we could never get a bottom line number of why the cost of the service went up that much without an explanation. They said it was 'taxes' & nothing could be done about that. I researched my online account, the help desk and my billing details & found nothing related to the 'taxes' and the increase & I mentioned to customer serivce that I wasn't satisfied. The first suggestion was 'did I want to cancel my service' which I found odd. I said I'd like to speak to someone before cancelling & was told I'd be contacted in a few days. I really wanted to understand why the rates went up without any notice or explanation.A week later, I was contacted by a rep named 'Julian' who emailed me and asked if I wanted to continue to cancel. He did not attempt to provide reasons why I should stay with Dialpad or even discuss my concerns. I asked to speak to someone before cancelling and he avoided the entire topic & followed up with me a few days later asking if I wanted to continue to cancel.I asked for a refund if I were to cancel because I had just renewed 2 months earlier & paid for a full year. He replied that wasn't their policy & wouldn't be possible. Only after I explained my dissatisfaction and that it was basically theft to collect for an entire year & not provide the service, he said he could request an approval for the refund.After I found an alternative service that I was happy with, I told him it would take about a week to port my numbers over and then I would reach out to him again. He emailed and asked 'would you like to cancel your service now?' and within 3 minutes of receiving that email, my service was disconnected. I never even had a chance to reply.After calling customer service and getting help from a very nice rep, she was as confused as I was why my service was disconnected without my consent. She attempted to contact 'Julian' but he would not respond to her. We stayed on the call together for a while and then she said she would follow up with me once she was able to restore my service.Please note I run a business and for this 3 hour time frame that it took to restore the service, my clients and prospects were getting a 'disconnected' message which not only refects poorly on my company (and reputation) but also cost me business.After about 3 hours my service was restored.I then contacted 'Julian' again and kindly asked him to wait on the request until the numbers were ported and then we could continue the cancellation.About 5 days later the numbers were ported and I again contacted 'Julian' to continue with the refund request authorization and cancellation. He replied and said that I was no longer qualified to request a refund. I replied to ask to speak to a manager or someone about this. I replied again, no answer. 4 days later, today, my service was canceled without any communication.Probably the worst experience dealing with a company since I've been working online, and that is 25 years now. And I don't leave negative reviews, only a handful in that time frame.Still to this day, NO ONE from Dialpad has reached out to me, asked if I would reconsider, asked what the issue was or anything relating to my service. Nothing. Even after I requested more than 4 times to be able to speak to someone about this. I did not receive a refund for the prorated service I didn't get now that my service is cancelled & paid through next March (2024). Disappointed is an understatement in this case & am considering my options at this time."

          "Contenu": "Subpar customer supportDialpad's tech and marketing talk a big game, and the tech delivers about 95% of the time. But support is awful. The customer success associates are not well informed, slow to answer, and are generally answering questions based on scripts that are haphazardly written. You will get the impression that customer support either:1. Did not read your question/email in it's entirety2. Does not understand Dialpad's processes3. Has never been in a customer support role ahead of this one4. Might not have a grasp on the English language, and may just be copying and pasting 90% of their responses to you5. They are absolutely overloaded and just can't devote more than 20 seconds to your email. We were super excited to work with Dialpad, but the customer support experience is killing that excitement quite thoroughly. We're a new customer (less than 3 months here) - this should be the honeymoon phase of the relationship, but after nearly 100 emails back and forth between my team and customer support, we're pretty much done."

          "Contenu": "We have been using dialpad for around a year now. The software itself is clunky but generally gets the job done, albeit after significant time tweaking everything. We have four desk phones that mostly work, but most features you would expect in a desk phone don't work with Dialpad. We have remote workers, though, which makes dialpads decentralized system a fairly good for for us.What really makes the software unusable is the support behind it. We applied to their latest \"startup\" offering and got accepted. After a week of back and forth, their general counsel wrote up our license agreement, and we both signed. The day after the contract was executed we got a random email saying they would not honor it and that the multiple employees who dealt with us were not properly trained to extend such an offer. We complained that we already had a contract signed by their general counsel, but they don't seem to care. Our costs will be around $350 more a month than under the contract they are breaking.Now we are in the process of moving to a different provider after having spent many hours configuring everything to their system. Worse, the IP phones Dialpad supports don't seem to be easily configurable to other similar companies.I would recommend against Dialpad. The software is a great idea with terrible implementation and misleading 'support'."

          "Contenu": "I run a law firm and all of our advice is given online, with a team that all works remotely. I chose dialpad based on the reviews but have to say my own experience of them didn't match what I had read and ended up cancelling after a few months.Call quality in the UK is not consistent. Ranges from really good to really poor in any given moment. This is not what you need for a business grade system. They also have very poor integrations with CRM's, particularly Zoho CRM. Lastly we use an 0800 number and their pricing is VERY expensive and all minutes rounded up. So even if you spend 1 second trying to connect, you get charged for a minute. I notified them of our intention to cancel the service and we moved to Ringcentral. Whilst waiting for the number to port, despite not using the service, they \"topped up\" our 0800 calling credit with \u00a3100. I did realise this into it was raised by our accounts department. I cancelled our service once the number had ported and then asked them for the \u00a3100 credit to be returned as we were not able to use it and nor did we ask for them to top our credit up. They outright refused, stating some small print in their terms and conditions that means you forfeit any outstanding credit when cancelling.That might well be the case, but it highlights their poor customer service where a team of people in Malaysia or some other low cost call center country are unable to apply any discretion or goodwill in order to maintain positive relationships with their clients.If you are in the UK and looking for a reliable provider with good customer service and connections, as well as an excellent integration for Zoho and other CRMs, then I recommend Ringcentral."

They are rude at the highest levels of that company.I paid for two lines at the annual rate and decided to find a different company after being disrespected repeatedly for asking simple questions about their poorly designed software. Since paying for the year in advance, one might expect a refund for the cancelled months, right? From a reputable company, yes. From Dialpad? That would be a no!When you ignore this review and buy the service anyway, don't expect a refund when you've had enough of the snarky remarks and passive aggressive comments from the children manning the phones over at Dialpad. This is because company policy only allows refunds to be given to those purchasing the month-to-month plans. However, they will do you a solid and escalate your refund request to a supervisor who will never get back to you with a definitive no. You'll figure it out when nothing happens.So, unless you enjoy being treated like a nuisance for not waking up the day after your purchase and having all the knowledge necessary to get the most from their service, DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY! Trust me, spend your money elsewhere."

Recently, the desktop app was not ringing in properly and I was missing calls. After my poor experience with several technicians and my last issue I took the time to figure out the problem myself which took several days and many lost calls. When the product works well it's a dream! When it doesn't it's a nightmare and for a small business like mine major issues has financial consequences especially when this is a paid service that doesn't consistently work. The only reason I will renew the contract with dialpad is because it's the only company, that I have found, that is HIPPA compliant. And I have been offered an incentive to leave this review."

As a pro customer you are not important and your business means nothing to them .You will have one point of call ( a lady called Charlene who is usually busy in meetings and I get the impression she is the only point of call for the entire uk customer base). She may refer you to customer support if she feels there is a need but this is the only way you will get referred to customer support- if you are lucky enough to get through to her. BASICALLY YOU DO NOT HAVE CUSTOMER SUPPORT !7.6.23. Thank you very much for taking the time to reply . I did what you said and you are right there is a number. However, it has taken me over a month and a somewhat a negative review via trustpilot to get this number and I should not have needed to go to such lengths to get this number. I won\u2019t name her but the sales person who sold me Dialpad and who remained my first and only point of contact up to this point is very incompetent because she was very clear time and time again that there is no customer support for all customers except for the enterprise customers. I am now wondering what else she has misinformed me on. On trialing Dialpad I was given a particular price for the addition of sms and an additional line and a few weeks back when I reached out to add those services they suddenly multiplied by an factor of 3 and I\u2019m now wondering whether these were correctly quoted. I would be grateful if you can either make contact or provide me with contact details so I can call you and double check a few points."

It was disjointed / unprofessional and the account manager delivering the pitch really did not even know their own product. They couldn't answer many of our relatively basic questions which wasn't at all reassuring. Our stakeholders receiving the demo would have disregarded them as a provider immediately however, luckily for them, our head of IT had used Dialpad at a couple of previous companies and rated it extremely highly. He delivered separate demonstrations to our own internal teams after Dialpad themselves had butchered their presentation. He should have been on commission because he was the only reason we decided to go for it in the end.The product is in fact pretty good whilst at times can be a bit buggy. The transcription service which was the main thing they actually made a real effort to show us doesn't work at all, so we have just disabled it.We've had a few queries / requests after using Dialpad for a period of time - every time we've reached out to our account manager (same person as original pitch) we have just been ignored, or had to chase to finally get an answer weeks later.All the positive reviews on here seem to be outside UK so maybe it's just the UK operation that is poor, as the product is okay. If you want a decent telephony system Dialpad does the job, but if service means anything to you, then I would avoid."

They made some strong concessions in an attempt to honor our original agreement from last year when we upgraded our contract.We are continuing to work with them and I have no complaints about the product itself. It is awesome. However I would still warn others to read their contracts closely before signing up.---------------------------------------Watch out for the bait and switch and read your contracts closely. We have been happy with our experience with them up until this year. Have over 30 users on their platform and spend thousands with them. Never have I ever worked with a tech platform that will allow you to upgrade a users seat type BUT refuse to allow you to remove their old license. Forcing you to pay for 2 licenses for the same users even AFTER their sales rep sold us on the ability to add seat types to lock in lower pricing but NEVER mentioned we would not be allowed to remove the old seat type. CRAZY, they are going down hill fast, stay away!!!!"

Headsets do not work on the server sessions, we have to use the app on a desktop and open another window to access our information on the server session.  We have figured the solution on our own but find that we cannot always answer the phone when it rings without having to refresh the app - missing inbound calls..  Using Dialpad on my cell phone is not  easy.  I am lucky if I successfully answer 1 in 10 of the calls forwarded there.  Most of the time, the outbound calls are just fine and once we get into our work, we have adjusted to the way we have to use our server session and the dialpad desktop app."

I suggested that feature to your company last year when. I consider it a basic phone feature you should included in version 1. Why do we have to contact you to move licenses from 1 site to another. That is just stupid and antiquated way of thinking. Your product idea is great but it needs a lot of improvement. I find your GUI complicated and kind of cumbersome. Some listed options don't even work as an average person would expect. Another good example is that the app is not keeping user settings after updating.The address book is another thing. I hate about the app. 1st it doesn't respect Call as XXX settings when calling(out) to people. 2nd One contact is duplicate 2, 3 or more times for some users.Your applications GUI, call dropping etc is why some people in our company are actually opting to keep their desk phone."

Call Quality is always amazing. My major complaint is with the Windows desktop app. when we call out it activates the headset linked to our PC, Sometimes when we call out the app will start to dial out, stop then dial out again within a 1 second period of time. this happens so quickly it triggers the headset to turn on, turn off and doesn't get the turn-on signal again. Customer service always seems like they are out on errands most of the time too or not to concerned with the issue. they have never completelypushed me aside and always came through for me however they always seem like they got better things to do. Moble app honestly has never failed me. Pretty much always realible. Very modern look which i like alot. This product is very appealing to business/ proffesionals of any trade with its look. All in all with all things considered I Would Recommend this product to anyone needing a cloud phone based system however it could use some bug fixes and attention to the desktop app."

In theory, I love the concept of VOIP for my business with everything handled online, and I think I chose them also because they support integration with my Obi device that allows me to use a traditional phone/headset with a VOIP service.In practice, it's just been ok. Lots of bugs, in my opinion, and I really haven't seen much progress with them. For example, I don't get most missed call notifications from the Mac desktop app so I have to open the app to check all the time. The organization across \"departments\" (i.e. different call menu options) is not intuitive. Sometimes the landline doesn't ring. And now for almost a week my texting did not work and I didn't even know the first couple of days as there was no error message, so I probably just missed some business / frustrated some potential customers. And then their customer support was slow and not that helpful.I hope they get new management to really nail this product for small online businesses like ours, or otherwise I will search for a better service."

          "Contenu": "I've been using UberConference for several years for a weekly professional telecon involving 30-40 people. In general, it works well. The recording option is excellent, and high quality. The phone line connections are almost always very good. That being said, a few months ago they did a big changeroo, in which control is now with a local app rather than an online web page. They did that with no warning. Just *poof!* you gotta be using this app! The new app works, but is less capable than the original implementation. One thing REALLY pisses me off. The original Uberconference used to have, in one corner of the page, an indicator of who is talking now, and who was last talking. That is now gone. The indicator of who is talking now is where the participant icon is highlighted. Now, these icons are big, and there are only eight or so on a page. So if you have a telecon with 40 people, and you want to know who is talking, you have to quickly scroll through all the icons to look for the one that is highlighted! But even worse is noise management. With forty people on the line, someone always has background talking, a barking dog, or something. You want to mute them. The indicator of who was last talking (or, interrupting, as it might be) was a great way to do this identification. That indicator is now GONE. So now, while the noisemaker is occasionally making noise, you have to quickly scroll through all the icons to see which one gets briefly highlighted when the noise is happening. This is AWFUL for noise management! I have complained about this to UC, and they say \"thanks, we'll think about it!\". Crapola. I'll probably be looking for a service that does things the way UC used to responsibly do it."

However, nothing can be perfect, and the system does have its ups and down, like only having a minimum of 4 digit extensions, only able to do blind transfers, room phones are kinda annoying to set up and use, and finally, for whatever reason, whenever i finish setting up a desk phone, I'm unable to every access the phones IP Config Utility again.While the service is great, after talking to them for various things, their support team is honestly just reading what's on the help center verbatim.Another very frustrating thing is that there is no way to directly contact the porting team. This has caused completely avoidable issues many times."

My company uses DialPad in its basic capabilities, but I can see there are options for receiving calls, receiving voicemail, call transcripts, call summaries, and more. My only feedback for improvement is that sometimes loading the software, and the connectivity for some calls, isn't as clear or as fast as I would prefer, but that also may be due to my Internet service. Overall, I'd give the software an A-."

We still find value utilizing this system, even at the steep-ish price we pay yearly. I'm glad of the route we went, if we ever go to self hosted or have or own PBX, we'll know what kind of features we want versus what we need.The features we use are great like group calling / ringing groups (departments), auto recording for said departments, call transferring (hard transfer only), auto attendant, open/closed hours, hold music, set holidays and more. The integrations are great as well, especially the HubSpot integration so that the team sees that call historical data of a contact so that we are on the same page. The analytic reports are nice so you can see trends (I can see when we typically see more or less calls depending on the day, month, year and now compare years). There isn't much to complain about except for the price. Maybe if they had a self hosted option that would be cool at a lower rate. Something to where the company has more control over it's data. Also their voice transcription sucks, it's funny to read them sometimes because they are so off. Overall it's probably the best soft-phone SaaS out there, but make sure to explore the options."

It took quite a while, I imagine due to complexity with the communication between providers. I wish this was able to be resolved more easily and quickly, since it ended up taking several weeks to port the numbers.Miguel stayed on my support ticket the whole way through. He was extraordinarily helpful and ultimately made sure the issue was resolved 100%. Thank you Miguel!"

There are a lot of settings and options on the user end, and it's not always clear what they do.

Instead of getting bounced around to someone new each time, you get one person assigned to you, who really understands the problems you're trying to solve. Also, no slick sales people offering you the world and then you find when it comes to induction that they don't offer that thing you wanted after all. Everything they said the app could do, the app could do. Thanks so much Charlene for all your help - hugely appreciated."

When I explained what I wanted to accomplish, he explained that I needed to purchase 2 \"AI\" lines to replace the 2 \"additional\" lines that I had purchased.  As I purchased the 2 \"AI\" lines, he put in the request to credit my account for 2 \"additional\" lines mistaken purchase.  Then Rey helped me obtain 4 sequential phone numbers for my company.  This is a service that only tech support can provide -- it isn't listed in the HELP section.  Rey made the process fast and easy.  Rey is a knowledgeable and customer-focused tech support rep.  The problem/solution situation I described is a shining example of why it's so important to allow customers to have direct access to tech support is vitally important.  (NOTE: I had to call the sales office in order to get connected to tech support.  Prior to this, I had carefully read all info pertaining to my set up needs and no where did it explain the difference between purchasing another \"AI\" line vs. an additional line.  It's really a shame that I had to waste so much time watching the DialPad set up youtube and re-reading the HELP section which didn't address my needs.

I love how economical it is for my purpose, and yet how scalable it seems to be for when the business expands. IMO the killer piece of functionality is the transcription of every call. So great to have a record I can go back to, and saves me taking copious notes. Even better is that it does this in real-time, so if the line is not perfect or if I switch focus for a second, I can still see what the other person said."

I had spent an entire week checking with all of the phone number sources before finally arriving at a few exciting numbers that would be important to our marketing and image.  I was given a number of status names such as: cooling, reserved, available.  These names meant nothing.  I responded with questions as to what these meant relative to the numbers I wanted.  The response was that they were now unavailable...they could not hold for very long.  I was furious.  These were numbers I would never be able to get again.  I was able to reach Marie de La Pena in support.  She was patient and listened carefully.  She took action, pressed the issue to the appropriate departments, and got the same numbers that I was told were no longer available.   How she did this I do not know.  But she saved the day.  I want to thank her from the bottom of my heart.  She is a credit to her company, especially in present times where service means little.   We were thinking very seriously of canceling our business with Dial Pad because of this ineptitude. Now we plan to stay.  Thank you again Marie."
