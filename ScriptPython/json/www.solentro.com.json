They cannot find the package.I spoke with an agent at FedEx on Thursday, Dec. 7th and they specified that Solentro was to email them with a picture of the package and description of the contents, (3 photo books).  I relayed that info to info@Solentro that same day and I have heard nothing back.  I resent the FedEx request particulars again yesterday and still have not heard back.  Please assist to bring this delivery challenge to a close.Angie DeMarco"

          "Contenu": "I was pretty disappointed by the customer service this time around. I placed the order in late December (23rd), and had minimal communication leading up to the Jan 7 delivery. I had to email the staff twice to actually find out. One, I never got a follow up email explaining my order was being tended two. Two, I never got an email explaining my order had been shipped/showing me a tracking #. Finally, it took over 2-weeks start to finish, and I feel last year it didn't take that long. I also felt the packaging was too loose. The books seriously moved around and incurred slight bending on the edges, despite the plastic packaging. Just pretty disappointed compared to last year's order. This is especially true when I'm paying an arm and a leg for shipping. It's frustrating when shipping is 25% of the order cost, and the delivery is poor/not communicated well."

Having to buy 10 made us just buy 20 as we would only pay shipping once. When we got it and started reading it, it was filled with errors that had not come up on your editing screen.  I put the copy in Google doc and it caught over 50 changes in both spelling and editing.  We switched to another medium and ordered one and caught another 50 mistakes. We had spent $200 on books that at first glance looked amazing, but we\u2019re riddled with errors.  You should have a disclaimer that states your editing program is weak.  Also in allowing us to purchase one copy we could have seen the finished product, fixed it and then ordered the number we required. It would have resulted in a much happier customer."

I found the entry of information a bit awkward as I had to go the the revew each time I wanted to see how it actually laid out on the page, which was time consuming, as it did not display the same way when entering it.

It was produced in the normal timeframe. There is no visibility online regarding production progress, ship date or ship method (thus no way to calculate arrival date), but, thankfully, they did provide tracking information upon request.

The book itself is quite thin, a little over a centimeter in thickness with the hardcover included.I experienced some technical issues whilst making the book in that pictures would randomly shift onto different pages or be removed entirely, even after having saved them to pages in particular, which meant I had to go through every page after each time I'd adjusted the pictures.The site could have some more default background images provided.I would have liked for there to have been a text background option to increase readability within the text on a colored background.Pros:The colors are vibrant and beautiful.I did have to contact customer support and received an answer very shortly after that helped me resolve some issues I was having in creating the book.The book was safely packaged in tight plastic wrap and then packaged in a sturdy box.Overall:I like the book as it is. It's a 60th birthday present for my mother and I'm glad I was able to customize it as I did and it gave it that much more meaning. The process of building the book itself was a bit tedious and did become an annoyance at times, but there's great customer support. The quality of the pages themselves are not what I expected, and the book is overpriced, in my opinion. If I were to have the need to order another book I would be hesitant about ordering through Solentro again. The quality is good and the colors are vibrant, it's just... Not what I expected."

I actually took a story that my husband wrote when he was in grade school and turned it into a children\u2019s book. It turned out very well and is great quality and their customer service was great and they were quick to respond to my emails. The only reason I didn\u2019t give five stars was it did not get here in time for Christmas. I think it was more FedEx\u2018s fault than Solentro\u2018s. Solentro sent it out in plenty of time but it was super delayed from FedEx.  That part was disappointing, but I will definitely use Solentro in the future to make any kind of book as the process was very simple and the quality was great"

          "Contenu": "Used Solentro to design a custom book for the 50th birthday of a friend. The entire user experience was very pleasant. Overall, the process was intuitive and simple. It might help to have the structure of the book preset before beginning the actual layout in the template, as editing at times is cumbersome and requires repeating some steps. By far, the most versatile platform for this kind of project. The weakest link is delivery time. Getting the book took forever even though I ordered it 3 weeks in advance and it was shipped via Fedex. Regrettably, the gift didn't make it in time; when my friend did finally get it, she loved the execution. I was tracking the shipment and noticed that it was stuck in a warehouse in Belgium for 8 days. Unacceptable. So if you are going to use this service for a specific event, design your book way in advance. I would use the service again and would recommend it to others as there are different format options and price points to meet different people's needs."

          "Contenu": "I used Solentro to create a hardcover book for my daughter chronicling an imaginary world we created over three years as part of a bedtime routine.  Solentro let me pull in photos and illustrations, lay out text in various ways, and use color.  The interface does have a few limitations, which is why I've rated Solentro four stars instead of five.  One is that layouts are modified and applied independently of where they are filled in, so it's tricky to make small changes to a layout to correct problems in spacing you see as you're filling it.  You need to go back to the layout screen; create a new, derivative layout; make the changes; apply that layout to the book, which in turn adds a page and pushes everything forward; drag each content element from the old page to the new one; and finally delete the old page.  I went through this numerous times.  I also wish page numbers were easier to add and customize, that there was an assisted function to create an index, and that multi-page images were more predictable in terms of center binding.Despite these limitations, I enjoyed the way that Solentro helped me bring my vision into reality.  The finished book came out quite well, and my daughter and I were both delighted with the quality of the printing.  I did encounter some glue breaking between the very first page and cover and again with the very last page and cover.  I fixed these by running a strip from a Crafter's Tape gluerunner down the inner edge of both pages.  I found no other issues.A note of caution: Solentro is a way to print something special, not to make something for sale.  The book I made was an 8x6 hardcover spanning about 50 pages in full color, and the price was a little over $100.  For a special gift, this was just fine. It wouldn't be viable to use this system to create books at a saleable price."

It came out so great! I was really impressed. Ship when they said it would arrive. My only complaint was it was not user friendly. When you change font size kept adding pages.

One is a better HELP function with questions and answers. Sometimes I had to read a whole page through before I figured out what I needed to do. Also, (and I don't know how you'd fix this), I ended up using a larger font and therefore editing text (sometimes pretty severely) because I couldn't figure out how the font size would translate to the printed page.

          "Contenu": "Yes, I would definitely use Solentro again as the final product was just as I'd hoped! However, I will say I didn't find the website overly intuitive. I wish they would post instructional videos on how to use the site, as I felt instruction was lacking (or else I didn't know where to look!). I think the biggest complaint I had was there is no 'word' or 'character' count when typing text. One has no idea when you've run out of space in a particular text box until you're finished typing and go to view the page and see you've run out of space. But it doesn't tell you at what point that happened. So with much trial and error, I finally figured out a system that worked for me. Once I got it down, then it went much smoother. I will say though, for every question I fired at them through email, they were very prompt in responding!  I wish they'd set up live chat sessions however. Many times I was working on the book and I'd have a question, and I'd have to wait until they responded via email as to how to solve the problem. More real time assistance would be wonderful! That said, the final product is exactly what I'd hoped it would be and will definitely use Solentro again!"

No worries about losing anything if not saved. \rIt was pretty easy to figure out the basics of how to create the book.\rThe template I used did not offer any option to be creative with using angled placement of text or photos, which would have really added to the final product. Not sure if there are other templates where this could be done. On the plus side, custom templates for pages were pretty easy to make. \rI was surprised when I placed the order and had both of my credit cards rejected without explanation. I eventually realized that, being a European company, a chip card was required. It would have been nice to know up front, or at least to have an explanation when my cards were rejected. The USA is unfortunately WAY behind Europe in using this technology, and many people don't yet have chip cards. I ended up having my brother pay, and coincidentally, 2 weeks later my new chip card arrived in the mail. \rOne final little issue is that the book covers (I ordered 10 copies) are all warping a bit unless they have weight on top of them. \rOverall though, it was a great website to use. I'd recommend it to others, but would love to see these little issues addressed."

          "Contenu": "The book turned out great.  I made a journal of when my son was born premature and in the NICU for 107 days.  The book was a good mix of text that I had written previously interlaced with images as he progressed in the hospital.  I knew I had a lot of text to copy and past into the book and Solentro met my needs.  The final quality of the gloss hardback book was great.4 Stars because:1)  The word/image template layouts are limited.  It's great you can customize your own, but some guides to placement would help.  Also would like a good choice of page layout/backgrounds as well as including stickers/captions/labels and free-text options2)  Some images will not be the right resolution in which case it get's a \"warning\" triangle.  The preview available for such types of images won't show you what you actually will get if you read the Solentro disclaimer.  Luckily my images turned out as expected but this feature made me nervous3) Previewing a page is tedious.  You have to open up the text and then select preview.  Otherwise you have to preview starting from page 1 and selecting the page number you want to go to.  There should be a button on the book preview where you can select a page and preview right from there4) Being a U.S. customer, I didn't realize this was a company in Sweden until I was ready to place an order hoping to get it in time for Mother's day.  I was hoping for more transparent shipping details, like estimate time for arrival upon placing my order.  Not until I received a fedEx tracking number did I know I'd be getting the book 2 weeks later"

Because it lets you design templates as you desire, YOU are in complete charge of each page's design. It never failed me. I don't know how long they store these creations, but I hope it is for a long time so that I can order more of the books and also make changes as I desire. All in all, this was a five-out-of-five-star experience."

And shipping, once the book was completed, arrived in less than two weeks via FedEx.I struggled a bit using the design templates but that was due to lack of familiarity.  After a couple weeks, I had no problems and truly found the design experience to be fun.  Print and paper quality was excellent. The final product arrived and it looked spectacular.  Exactly the way I viewed the book online in \"preview\" mode.  Pricing was very fair and reasonable.  Overall, I couldn't be happier with the final product and do not hesitate to recommend Solentro to anybody."

So I simply took a screen-shot on my MAC computer of each page, then uploaded each imaged (JPG) page into the template.  Thus, I simply uploaded 12 images, which consisted of my pre-populated text and images!  Bingo!  it worked perfect:  crystal clear images and clear, readable font.  Solentro should inform the user that this is an option, or Solentro should have a simple PDF upload ability that can be converted to the draft for submittal.  But my attempted as described worked soo perfect.  The paper quality is also very nice.  I went with the glossy cover which is great.  the inside pages are also of high quality, heavier stock, mat finish.  Lastly, I submitted my order on 1/8/22 and got my product on 1/24/22, here in Seattle!  I cannot be happier!  And prices are nice."

          "Contenu": "I created a poetry book for my uncle for Christmas this year, probably one of the most heartfelt gifts I have ever made for anyone. I ordered my books about a little over a week ago and received them today (I live in the US). They were ABSOLUTELY PERFECT, they were more beautiful than I had even imagined and I could not be happier. I was so worried I had ordered them too late and because of holiday shipping delays they wouldn\u2019t get here by Christmas, but they got here so fast I was amazed. This book is so special to me I almost hugged the FedEx guy who delivered them. Thank you Solentro and FedEx for all your hard work, you are going to make this a very special Christmas for my family. I will 10000% be using this company again and I absolutely recommend it everyone. It is absolutely worth the money. THANK YOU!!!"

Always order a back up on my singles, yet found one of them to be a little darker on the photos then the other.  I edit my pictures for brightness, contrast, exposure, saturation, blackpoint, etc.  Some did not seem to come back to me the way I put them in.  Not sure if I need to change from glossy to matte, or what is best for picture books.  Still very satisfied with overall product.  I will be changing from jpeg to raw, and will be able to do a much better editing job for the next book.  Fred"

There were two mistakes in the book, my doing, not Solentro's, two poems were  published back to back. And a mistprint in one of the poems. But with that being said. The book is awesome.
