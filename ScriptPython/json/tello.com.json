Not just a little bad, horrible.  I could compare it to other wifi in coffee shops, et cetera, and it still sucked.  Away from a little town--almost nothing.  I had continually tried to impress upon any Tello representative that wi fi hot spot was my priority.  Always heartfelt promise of not just good or acceptable service, but rather the best!!!!   Not true.  Any and all promises now from Tello are subject to the most stringent scrutiny.  They have all drunk the kool-aid.  More BS from yet another rip off phone company."

          "Contenu": "Poor interaction. Representative asked for an order number, there wasn't one I could see. They didn't understand the issue and gave a standard response instead of an appropriate one. They then find the information later and no longer request the order number, then they ask for the error message after already having provided it to you multiple times. Then throughout describing the issues I was having they kept answering the same unhelpful answer, showing they didn't actually listen to the questions/info I was asking about. They then kept asking the same question instead of actually reading the response. Then at the end it was frustrating to ask for this survey multiple times, and instead being told to call in about the issue, then was told I asked about the order number ('Order' was the first word of the error message, but never anything about an order number) when the transcript shows I never did.Just please, for the love of god read the responses, and answer. Especially when I'm already doing what you ask. But if I have to explain the same thing to you multiple times because you can't get it the first 2-3 times... not even using different words, just copy/pasting the exact same error message. It's frustrating and makes me feel like you do not care about the customer in the least. You're putting zero effort into the interaction. The whole point of contacting Tello was because the other carrier said Tello was denying the request, there was nothing more they could do. Understand that I'm just trying to get to the bottom of it.EDIT: \"We noticed that you were able to port your number successfully, the rejections were due to the incorrect port information provided on the request itself\" - INCORRECT. The port request was successful because I altered my Tello address multiple times with false/different addresses in order to finally get the porting to go through. It wasn't that I needed to correct the address in there, it was that the address in there wasn't working, as I tried telling your representative multiple times. Even copying and pasting and ensuring no errant spaces/characters were present. I had to put in bogus addresses until one worked."

Would do nothing for me, the adult, on the phone, who pays for everything. I spoke to a customer service representative. Did not catch his name, spanish accent. Worst people skills I have ever encountered. Thank god they showed how bad they sucked before I ported the other 3 lines. Too bad cause the price is right but this guy was borderline slow at best, more likely the type of lazy that kills the companies bottom line.  DONT TRY ITThey replied to the review with a decent response. Unfortunately none of that happened. I verified everything...for a half hour  and the rude guy said his supervisor was more comfortable texting a security code to a sixth grader. So that wasn't the case for me...you're right. The case for me was I verified everything and the unnamed supervisor felt the integrity of the account was better off in the hands of a child.My pin was not changed by me. They would not help me despite my number, name and email on the account they insist on texting a code to my minor children's line. Nonsensical and In no way secure.  The response is not only stretching the truth but outright fabrication in part.  If you want a cheap line for your kids. Don't set it up with your info because they will want to text the kids line a code despite 47 minutes of verifying it's you. Not to mention the catch 22 that if you start the account with your info and buy their phones you don't know the numbers yet. How the heck can this system work? All your set up info is worthless? Now you're childs number controls the account. Not you with your actual account info.Thanks for the reply. Try hiring or training people with logic, reasoning or even compassion. What a strange apology Tello. I get where the csr developed the bad attitude. Top down."

It was not approved so I left it here for others to be aware of what to expect. Actual 2g speeds are indeed usable. However, the recent testing done on the tello network of the throttled data once 4g data was exceeded left me completely dissatisfied.2g provides data transfer speeds between 64kbps and 256kbps with good reception. Using the tello network speeds were observed to be maxed out at 30kbps (0.03mbps) when the signal strength was the strongest. The testing was conducted over the course of 7 days in multiple areas with signal strength reading between -63dBm and -99dBm at testing.My observation is tello throttles data much below the standard 2g network, making their service very much unusable once data cap is reached."

          "Contenu": "In determining if we should switch our service to Tello, we first checked to see if our phones were compatible with their network.  We used THEIR IMEI system checker on their web page, (home page linked to \"bring your own phone\"), for all of our phones.  It indicated all our phones would work, (both Apple phones and my wife's Android Galaxy A12), but...not so much.  First, it took a full week to get the SIM card for the A12.  the iPhones were eSim eligible).  Once we ported over to the Tello network, we had difficulties making calls, receiving calls and sending/receiving texts so finally we called Tello.  They informed us that our Samsung Galaxy A12 wouldn't work on their network even though their web page says it does.  Their response from customer service was to hold on to the phone and wait for an update from Samsung, and that many customers who have the A11, A12 and A13 are having problems with the Samsung updates making the phones work with Tello. Really! And what am I supposed to do until then?  The Tello agent also agreed that their site should say that the Samsung Galaxy A-12 is not compatible.  Now that we have ported over all our phones from our previous service provider, which worked fine with our phones to one that only supports 2 of our three phones is very disappointing. We switched over to save money, but is it worth it? Time will tell, but now I have low confidence level in Tello.  I feel it is a poor and deceitful business practice on Tello's part, especially the flippant attitude of \"oh well, wait for an update or buy a new phone\"."

          "Contenu": "Deceptive marketing.  Company advertises plans named for their amount of high-speed data, in all cases but one.  So, there's a 500 MB plan, 1 GB plan a 5 GB plan, 10 GB and \"Unlimited.\"  They even promote it as \"Unlimited EVERYTHING --For Real...\".  However it has a limit of 25 GB of high-speed data.  So, if they were honest, they would call it the 25 GB plan, consistent with all their other plan names.  They are not honest.  The limit on the \"Unlimited\" plan is disclosed only in smaller print at the bottom of an interior page of their website.   Shame on them! \"Unlimited Everything\" is a lie.They have s sleazy tactic for clouding the issue:  You get unlimited 2G data.  But 2G data and high speed data are two different things.  They do not give you unlimited high speed data, so \"unlimited everything\" is a lie.2G data will not get you access to the Lyft app for example.  All the other plans are identified by their amount of HIGH speed data. And then they call this plan \"unlimited\". And yet the fine print contradicts that by imposing a 25 GB limit on high-speed data. Very deceptive! And apparently intentionally so.I provided this phone to a refugee living in a shelter without Wi-Fi. She needs lots of data because she's having numerous Zoom calls with various aid agencies and she was given a credit for Lyft that she can only access by the Lyft app which uses high-speed data only. She has two small children with various medical needs. She hit the 25 GB limit which we didn't know about just when she needed to access the Lyft app in order to take one of her children for medical care. We couldn't figure out what was wrong.  Finally I called Tello and discovered that \"unlimited everything\" to them means 25 GB of high-speed and no more. After much argument they allowed half a gigabyte additional but would not honor the promise of \"unlimited everything\" They also would not let me talk to a supervisor.I'm done with Tello but would like to save others from being cheated in the same way so I am posting this on Trust Pilot and have filed a complaint with the attorney general.  A half truth is a whole lie and lying to consumers is against the law."

Same network, Mint sym.  Works. 3 months with Tello. Didn't. Also was unable to port in or out numbers from Tello, and again Tello pointed the finger at the other guys. And the reply says it all. Wow. I tried porting in and out, filled out the forms, and it failed in and out of tello. As to 5g and lte my mint card on same phone on same tmobile network works  fine, while tello to this day requires I put my phone in 3g mode to work. The reply below is finger pointing when all facts points inward and is exactly the response I got when I spoke to tello for 3 months. \"The fix is coming in a few weeks\" was the repeated month after month reply."

Before I made those 3 calls, I sent an email to Tello and they sent me the same steps to troubleshoot which I had already tried, and although I told them very clearly I had already tried the different steps over the phone, they still made me go over the steps over and over again wasting my time. This was such a bad experience for me that I decided to change my line to a new carrier. Tello should hire more people that actually have some knowledge about their lines and technology."

Went to Tello\u2019s website to take a screenshot and noticed that some minutes had\u00a0been used. Wanting to be sure that my phone number was still not working, I tried making a call again. To my surprise, it was now working. I want to thank Trustpilot as I believe they were instrumental in resolving this issue. Also want to thank Tello for finally getting my phone working again. To be fair, Tello provides unequaled service AND pricing. They have an awesome website to manage your account. For instance, it allows you to see the Number called, Date & Time of the call,  how long the call was, and the Cost of the call. However, the best part of their website enables you to customize the service plan you want such as the number of minutes and MB. Doing so gives you the lowest price possible. You can also choose not to have a plan and select Pay As You Go. Since I do not know which option is best for me, I have a customized plan for one line, and the Pay As Yo Go for the second line.END OF UPDATE #2UPDATEIn my review, I had 2 issues. 1) The first and most important one of all was that after adding 300 minutes by renewing, I was unable to make any calls or receive message as it showed \"Call Failed\". 2) The second issue was about eSIMs. Received Tello's reply that only addressed the second issue regarding eSIMs. They glossed over the first issue about the phone being unable t\u00f8 make or receive any calls. Tried calling using that line and it is still not working. If line isn't working in 2 days, I'll lodge a complaint with the CPUC. Additionally, will seek the advice of legal council to ascertain if this matter can be litigated for actual and punitive damages. I've had this number for 15 years and have missed many costly calls and messages.                       END UPDATERenewed a plan. However, when making a call now, it shows \"Call Failed\". Renewed my plan for another Tello number which worked fine. Have spoken with 4 argumentative representatives who were of no help whatsoever. One told me to shut down my iPhone and would call back in 5 minutes but never did, which is a common occurrence. Another representative said there was a problem with my phone. I\u2019ve spoken with this particular person many times in the past who ALWAYS says the problem is on my end no matter the issue. He refused to escalate this matter. I asked to speak with his supervisor and was transferred to an answering machine. Left a message but again, never received a call back. Another representative told me to take the phone to an Apple Store. Another representative put me on hold to research this\u00a0issue. He returned 10 minutes later stating 2 lines cannot be  on at the same time. It\u2019s been a week now and the number still doesn't work. There is another issue which has been unresolved for 2 weeks . . . it no longer supports 2 Active (ON) lines. Although I have 3 SIMs, all phones only have the capability to have 2 Active (ON) lines at the same time. With 2 Active (ON) lines, this allows a person to make or receive calls on either line. However when doing so, it puts the other Active line on Standby mode until the call is completed. This feature works with a 3rd party SIM card and an eSIM as well as using two eSIMs.I\u2019ve spoken with 5 representative regarding this issue. All adamantly state that my phone is incapable of having two Active (ON) lines even though I\u2019ve been able to do since day one using their service. This feature works with a 3rd party SIM card and an eSIM or two eSIMs.Spoke with Tello\u2019s main competitor Mint Mobile. They acknowledge that my phone is capable of having 2 Active (ON) lines simultaneously. The pricing for their plans is competitive. Unlimited calling/text with 5GB is $15. Tello has the same plan for $19. Since Mint Mobile has better pricing with knowledgable  good-natured customer support representatives, the choice for me is clear . . . No more Tello nightmares!!!"

For e.g., if the plan cost is $20 and you have $19 as Tello Dollars, you cannot use it towards your plan. Either you have to refer someone else and get more Tello Dollars or buys cheaper plan for which charges + taxes is less than or equal to Tello Dollars.3) Tello does not work at all in Canada and Mexico.

If I don't give more info, they will take my review down. Let's say now I think I understand why Tello has such a good overall rating and mostly positive reviews.Update2: Tello flagged my review. Lol. Initially I wrote quite polite that the reception was unstable. How did we get here, Tello? I will be leaving you because not only you have below average service (which is undoubtfully affordable though), but you are flagging your customers..I mean, really!? Do you have to take down every review that gives you less than 5 stars?"

I have reset my network setting so many times to no avail. I have used other networks and never got this before. Anyway that's me, I can't tell if this happens to others, but it's not a service I can always rely on. I read recently Tello still uses the Sprint network, don't k ow if it true but it's a shame."

On the rare occasion I need to travel, roaming between towns is almost non-existent. Get what you pay for I suppose. The other star it lost is for the hassle to get data to rollover. If you let the plan renew automatically, you lose the remaining unused gigabytes from the prior month. If you renew manually, the unused data rolls over, but you lose the remaining days on your plan. The only way to not lose days or data is to renew manually between midnight and whenever that morning the auto billing system runs your account. This is an enormous PITA! I never had any previous service providers pull this kind of BS. Again, you get what you pay for. Otherwise, the service has been fine. It's just the corners they cut are more than mere inconveniences."

Also, the coverage is not as good as what we had with Sprint. We find that about 30% of the time, the calls are dropped at our home. The pricing is great! One call to customer service was good."

I  put my wife\u2019s phone now on it  not to mention plans r cheaper than others. Well worth it. Just do it trust me."

For T-Mobile, I still feel like it's $3-5 dollars too much per month, and I wish the limited plans, i.e. no-very little data and unlimited calling were a bit cheaper.Another gripe is T-Mobile itself. They don't cover half of what others do and their data network \"goes down\" or \"malfunctions\" randomly every few days regardless of signal. It's a shame Tello's model doesn't scale to other carriers. With a triopoly dominating I'm sure this doesn't leave as many choices nor wiggle room, but it would be nice to see similar prices and choose other networks."

          "Contenu": "UPDATE: Tello technical support was helpful and easy to work with, and call quality after our support session is good, although mobile data speeds have stayed the same slow 1.4 Mbps download (half Tracfone in my area). The support technician guided me in adding a custom mobile network entry (APN wholesale, MMSC domain name wholesale.mmsmvno.com, ask Tello for the remaining settings).ORIGINAL REVIEW, BEFORE TELLO SUPPORT CALL:Tello is an excellent price, but with my 4G cell phone call quality is poor and data speed is slower than expected in my neighborhood (I get 1.4 Mbps download speed), making online shopping painfully slow. Tracfone is delivering double the data speed (2.7 Mbps download) and better service overall in my town. But the price of Tello is much lower than Tracfone, especially with its plan flexibility, and WiFi calling vastly improves call quality at home, so its functional for me. Also, the \"My Tello\" app is more reliable than the Tracfone \"My Account\" app for checking balance and changing the plan."

These aren't deal breakers by any means and I still highly recommend the service.First, the coverage can lack in some areas. By comparison a friend who has ATT won't lose service in more remote areas while I will.Second, if you buy one plan then decide to upgrade part way through, you have to buy the complete new plan not just pay the difference.For example, you buy a [1gb $10] plan but then decide to get [unlimited $30] plan a couple days later.Instead of charging you $20 to upgrade, you pay the full $30.Not a big issue and not something that effects the quality of service.Just wanted to say incase someone else was curious.TLDR: Great service, minor coverage issue (i.e. wooded/remote areas), let your gb balance run out before upgrading/downgrading."

Thanks to the support staff and technicians for getting my service restored.---Original Review---At the time of this review, it's been 6 days of not having service following my port into Tello mobile. I am literally not receiving calls or texts to my number.I've been contacting support everyday and just cannot get anything more than \"we sill send it to technical support.\" Six days and they have not figured out why my line is not working.I hate leaving bad reviews but after 6 days, I have to. The only thing I can do is hope someone is actually trying to resolve my issue. Being helpless and without my phone number is a gut blow.Hopefully at some point, I get my number working but now that this is approaching a week, I have little to no optimism.

          "Contenu": "I joined Tello around 03/06/23. I almost wish I had known more about Tello a while ago. I have always had a flip phone and that is still the type I carry with me. I also recently got my first and last smartphone (forced into it). I rarely ever turn it on or even look at it, but the problem was that I could not get a data plan for it through my previous carrier (T-Mobile). It wasn't that they did not offer it is that they only have one plan and it is far more than I need and unaffordable. The bigger offense was that they lied to me for two months making all kinds of promises that I later found out were completely false (not only customer reps, but supervisors as well)! I only needed 1 GB of data and though it would be nice to have both phones with one carrier, but I can't afford $65 per month for something I will never use.I was very skeptical of Tello, thinking it was a fly by night scam or something, but I needed to leave T-mobile (who no longer has good customer service) mostly for the lies. I decided to take a chance with Tello for both phones. (I now understand what Tello is better). I am not used to DIY for cell phones and was scared I would mess things up setting up service with Tello, but the customer service is amazing! From before service to setting up, I was able to get someone on the phone almost immediately and every question was answered. Not only did I get set up, but I even ported my number, which happened in record time (after I threatened T-mobile, who were being uncooperative, by citing chapter and verse of the law regulating mobile services). Once I got what I needed, Tello ported my number in less than an hour!I now have a custom plan (love that) and paying half what I was for my flip phone coverage and getting more than I had with T-mobile directly! I opted for one sim chip that I will switch back and forth between the two phones as needed, which won't be much. (I only need data for places without Wi-Fi and I'm rarely in that situation).  To date, the service has been fantastic! I think this is really the way to go."

Every time I have called, they have answered my questions thoroughly and even gone above and beyond with personally typed out emails providing instructions. Also, VERY VERY important is that they are not an off shore phone bank of foreigners parroting predetermined responses, but rather they have service reps that are native English speakers or if foreign born, their accents are not too heavy. Very reasonably priced plans as well that don't require a contract. Good job Tello!!!"

Consider that we rely on cell phones exclusively for communication... we dumped our landline years ago...we get more cellular data than we need, both lines together cost under $30 total, it's beyond me why anyone would voluntarily pay more! After all, a phone call is a phone call, a MB is a MB regardless of which carrier supplies it. It's the same!"

Because my budget does not justify investing in home internet service (I'm not even sure it's available where I live but, if it is, I'm sure it's not cheap), I depend on my Tello account for all communication with the outside world.  Not surprisingly, it is easy to use up the data. But Tello's increase of data and decrease on price really means a lot. As important, it also demonstrates that Tello appreciates our business and desires to cultivate loyal customers. We could be cynical and point out that there's stiff competition among providers and so chalk up Tello's business move to no more than an effort to remain solvent. But I think Tello should be commended for--and feel good about--the approach to solvency they have chosen. They already have very good pricing and very good customer service. They didn't have to make this move to keep my business.  I'm grateful."

She was able to correct the problem on the company level and IT WORKED! I was so excited. I'm sorry I forgot to fill this out. I called right away to tell her it was working and got Edgar Nunez who offered to mail me the review. THANK YOU, LUNA!"
