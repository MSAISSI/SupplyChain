          "Contenu": "To be my first ever boost, I am truly disappointed.Edited: No one complained about the games, but if I pay to get boosted to Gold IV in less than 3 days and ending at Silver II in 4 days, then there's something wrong.It's not the customer's fault that the webpage gives a price with a 20% discount offering you that \"everything's gonna be alright\" and \"not to worry about anything\".Not to talk about the lack of communication with the booster (Barely reply 7 hours after talking), asking multiple times to spectate the matches (Barely impossible, had no find my own way to see the replays), or with customer support, where I asked multiple times to switch the booster so I could communicate better and make everything easier for both parties, which of course was impossible (Even though on the chat one of them said he had - literally - too many orders.)Be aware? Yea."

However during the service it took them 25 games - the overall record of 15 wins 10 losses (60%wr) from a master or higher player. This also goes against a statement on their FAQ aswell as they say that the boost will be a minimum of 1 division per day below diamond 4. This silver 1 boost took them about 3 days. I had no issues with the website/communications with the booster just a bit disappointed in the results due to the simplicity of the order as I could of completed this quicker myself"

They did complete my effective request and they did it in a good final rush. Honda is always online for any concern and, after speaking to him, I'm sure they are trying to fill an immense load of requests. What went wrong: I can't go down to 3 starts because, in the end, I appreciate the work of this guys and I don't wanna be the nit picker of the situation, though must be said that the communication with my booster were practically absent and I got only random answers. To this day there are still a lot of things I don't know which would have been resolved with a quick confrontation. Indeed, I feel like more than one guy did climb using my profile and maybe it would be good to know that and to have some minor chit-chat with the new acquaintance. In the end you know that you will get what've paid for but, for me at least, not necessarily more than that. Which is quite good obviously, but could be improved just a little tiny bit of communication. In the end I will leave 4 star as you can see and wish all the best to the guys."

( Original post which I gave 1 star)I had then spoke with Honda the new Manager of the players and they assured me I would get what I was promised.

However the second booster was incredible and made up for it. Even threw in extra games to make up for the losses. He really redeemed what would of ultimately been a charge back. I'd highly suggest making sure your booster is at least GM/Challenger. As the more I see Diamond/M players they can't carry in high plat/low diamond. Its essentially just paying someone that knows what they're doing play on your team, but if everything goes bad by feeding/intnig/afk they're pretty much a sitting duck. If it was Silver/Bronze im sure it'd be fine."

They were also two hours later to begin than what they said, and also refused to stop for a rest when I asked which made me stay up very late. I would consider other options for boosting that offer more tailored experiences if you're trying to be discreet.Edit: I should note however, I had a 100% winrate and they did a great job at winning the games with no issue, I just really wanted to be discreet and was looking forward to seeing how a Challenger could boost me from support role, but then they brought in a random duo to carry the games instead(which if I wanted a duo boost, I would have paid for and played my account myself with that duo booster.I wasn't a fan of my booster personally, but the customer service was very nice. Hopefully they learn for next time so they can service us low-elo players better."

I can guarantee you the management reads every single review and communicates with its customers for improvement. That is what happened to me after I wrote my \"Mixed Feelings\". CSR informed me about booster side during the order and I appreciate it for that. After our little chat, they offered me a partial refund with a good discount for my next purchase.I straight up purchased my favorite booster \"stormii\" . Guy is super cool and I like him a lot. And he is a great Jungler / Mid player too.  Feedback 1#(3 Stars): I have used their service before and I loved it previously. However, this time I'm not so certain. Booster was a cool guy sending me clips during his boosting sessions but overall performance seems like a casual plat player smurfing on low elo. Heck he even had 1/11 Zed performance. Booster asked me if he can get a character which I allow him to do to make sure he is super comfortable. However, I cannot tell. Maybe it is just my bad luck or he had his thing in his life that could not allow him concentrate but 1/11 Zed from a booster that claimed \"Professional\" is not something I expect."

Important thing here is that not all the boosters will smash your ranks with 100% win rate, but they will also lose sometimes when they meet bad teammates, or they have on-going life issues. The latter case, it will let you to wait a little bit more time than your expectation. In this perspective, the most important part of this servicing is communication between customers and the service providers. The whole communication with Lol-eloboosting team was efficient and satisfying enough to wait for the delay and their communication skills to alternate and control the situation was fairly appropriate. Shortly, Lol-eloboosting service will do their best to satisfy their customers even though we, as customers, encounter unexpected situations. Finally, I will recommend this service if you want to have a good experience. Thanks."
