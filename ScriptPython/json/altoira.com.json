Our next step is to file a complaint with FINRA to get this resolved.4-4-23 update. The transfer has been completed.

Most of their problems seem be be due to flaws in their infrastructure, particularly in transfers into and out of Alto. I also never got a call back from any of their investment \"partners\"- which makes me wonder. Although they do have some friendly people in their customer support, the  accounting on their is cause for concern. I still have a small amount of remaining money in their accounts which I am trying to transfer from Lending Club to them, and then to a very large brokerage. It should have be seamless and simple, but instead the process has taken 3-4 weeks thus far -this time around. The customer service hotline is a fairly torturous phone queue. (the jazzy 4 measure one handed piano player jingle will drive you insane), but if you know the backdoor phone number and email  you may do better. ."

Any transfer out of alto was stalled, delayed or stopped altogether, unless you called every day\u2026 Literally every day hammering on them to complete the transaction.  Deposits, routinely lost.  transfers out\u2026 routinely went into the ether.  Over all the years I was a customer with them auto was never able to complete a single wire transfer successfully the first time in fact, they were never able to complete a wire transfer in Two tries.  Alto, in every case\u2026 And I mean in every case\u2026 Required three tries to complete any wire transfer in or out.I can\u2019t tell you how strongly I recommend against using Alto. avoid this company at all costs."

I have had to file a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau because of a 2+ month delay, and possible lost checks.  See: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Complaint Number 211019-7461102  My biggest complaint is that transfering money into and out of Alto IRA was never smooth, involved countless hours of calling various parties and leaving emails. They always respond with a generic email saying they are listening, but the responses and customer service are minimal and insincere.  Obviously they are a young company with lots of growing up to do. I wont be keeping my money there for much longer."

          "Contenu": "Go somewhere else with your business Part 2For clarification in my first review. I started the transfer process in June 2021 and was finally completed at ALTO in November 2021.ALTO was closed for two weeks for COVID at the end of October and beginning of November 2021. If you read my first review, it may have sounded like the  two week shutdown occurred earlier. Once again, I was never notified of the closure and left without any communication.ALTO, you responded to my Part 1 one star review  with: \u201c\u2026. We understand that there is definitely an urgency when it comes to exercising warrants and transferring shares to another custodian.\u201dMy response: My paperwork with my custodian to where the shares were being transferred into, from ALTO expired after 90 days. Since this process took nearly five months, I will have to refile another TOA(Transfer of Assett) form. Right, doesn\u2019t sound like a big deal and if it were the only delay or  miscommunication from ALTO, it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal. However, stack it on top of everything I\u2019ve already mentioned, it\u2019s just another area where ALTO created more work and frustration for me where if things were handled in a timely manner, I wouldn\u2019t be here giving ALTO another one star review.James"

They want you to email them and have to wait days until they decide to call back. If you miss their call, the process starts all over again. Even when you leave a VM or email addressed to a particular person someone else contacts you back.I made the HUGE mistake of filling out a partial application online and quit because I could not get Conner to call me back regarding a question I had. I have emailed and spoke to Tom, Conner and Robert saying I wanted nothing to do with this company and wanted to be taken off their contact list and my info erased. Then I was emailed that their website was hacked and I needed to reset my password! I am furious they did not remove my personal info...SS#, birthdate, name, address, etc. After about a dozen emails and 2 phone calls they refused to issue me free credit monitoring for 1 year. Please do not even talk to ALTO as you are wasting your time and setting yourself up for major problems. If their customer service is this poor before they get your money, I cannot imagine how bad it would be after they get your account and money. There are better people to deal with. Alto is the worst!"

I had the opportunity to choose my own custodian or do nothing and automatically move to Alto. My experience has not been good since. I decided to move from LC to Prosper for note investing, so I transferred some available funds into Alto. The transfer wasn't happening, but after contacting LC, they straightened out the problem and my funds showed up in my Alto account as cash balance. Then the real fun began...I initiated a custodian to custodian transfer from Alto to Millennium with both Alto and Millennium. Millennium made the transfer request to Alto over two weeks ago, and that's the last either I or Millennium have heard from Alto. Missing in action. They have not responded to communications from anyone. Alto still shows my transfer as 'pending initiation' and there it sits, even though Millennium initiated it over two weeks ago. So I'm left with my funds lost to Alto and no communication from them. The other companies have been very responsive and helpful, but Alto just outright sucks...not a nice thing I can say about them. So beware of dealing with Alto. I have a hard time believing the good reviews here are for real."

          "Contenu": "I have had an account with Alto IRA since March of 2020.  At the time I was putting money in, customer service was good.  There were a number of glitches in getting the account set up and the money in, but they were a new company, and they communicated well enough throughout the process, so that wasn't a big deal.  What has been has been the literally abysmal customer service since then.  It seems like as soon as they have your money they put no effort into timely customer service, and they take no responsibility for issues on their side.  I missed the chance for one investment (a partner firm) because the process did not work and I couldn't get timely support.  They've also raised fees since I signed up and yet conveniently didn't respond to any of my inquiries for the month leading up to the change so I couldn't make the investment I wanted before the change (which would make the same investment much more expensive).  I don't expect a new company to be perfect, but I do expect them to try to take care of their customers, and to make reasonable accommodations to their customers when failures on their side do occur.  To me this has seemed more like a money grab, where they get you in the door to make their numbers look good but then put no effort into providing anything close to the service that was promised.  To sum up, I've been paying for the service for almost 2 years and have not been able to make one investment.  Not one."

After asking for wire instructions....they don't wire the money...you find this out from the sponsor instead of Alto that it wasn't sent.... fortunately the company was very understanding and spent a lot of their own time trying to get Alto to perform and kept me informed. Alto refunded the wire charge, in some small effort to compensate for a week of unecessary agrivation and delay...but true to form, they went and charged me for it anyway a couple days later..after saying they would not....

Thought I was signing up for coin trading SEP IRA instead I managed to sigh up for just a SEP IRA.  This was a bit confusing considering I knew exactly what type of account I was after.  Since my transfer was coming from Fidelity, the right of recision had expired. At least that was in my favor.  Pretty much nothing else was.I had called the day after I initiated my transfer and spoke to Paul Hayslip, he informed that I had signed up for the wrong type of account.  Not to worry, it could be fixed on the back end within the next few hours.  I checked later that day and still no change.  I sent him an email with zero response.  I called, zero response, online help, zero response, so I let it go for the day.  The following day I checked back. Zero response, there was not a soul to be found! It took about a week before Paul responded (nobody else responded period to any of so called help or chat lines).  He claimed that there was an email sent out.  I can't imagine for the life of me why they could have a message displayed after logging in with this disclaimer.  I get it, they're a start up but when you're dealing with peoples money, accessibility is the key to success.  Plus being new, most emails could be considered spam or junk.  I don't think they did, I never received any notification, checked both junk and spam folders. Finally the account is coded correctly, the transfer is complete, lets get some money invested...  Nope,  you have to transfer from your account to the trading account.  This doesn't happen when you push the buttons, who knows what has to happen.  More sit and wait. Finally after several hours, the transfer is complete.  Don't get too excited, trades have to process as well.  They take 5 plus minutes per trade.  No API interface at this time either.  All in all, its a very slow process with terrible communication response time and you might as well cancel any communication if its a holiday, not just for the day, for the week!The one positive Alto offers, decent coin options based on Coinbase. Good luck, hopefully thing get better or other companies understand the importance or solid communication.  1 Star at best."

The issue throughout the entire ordeal was that Alto did not communicate at all with me. Every time I tried to email, I got an automated message back with no response from a service representative. Nobody at Alto has apologized or done anything to make the situation right. It's a real shame that the customer service is so poor, because the products Alto offers are good."

The FAQ they kept sending me did not relate to my question and had to do with rolling over an IRA but I was rolling over 401ks. 401k rollovers are pretty straightforward. The transfers team had no idea what they were talking about, and kept telling me I needed to fill out paperwork for them to submit to my 401k administrator. 401k administrators do not accept 3rd party paperwork. The customer experience is terrible. I sent at least 5 emails asking someone to call me. They wasted my time, and they wasted their time sending all these incorrect email responses when all they had to do was pick up the phone.  With how terrible the customer experience is, there has to be a directive from leadership to not use the phones. Problems of this size within a company always comes down to leadership. I'm sure the transfers team was trying their best. They clearly were under trained, under staffed, and not supported. I asked for a call multiple times from a manager or someone who actually knew what they were talking about. This isn't a magazine subscription service. This is people's life savings. The only reason I stuck w Alto is because of their relationship with Coinbase and the options that provides for crypto choices. Terrible company. Terrible user interface. Terrible use experience. But currently, if you want to be able to choose crypto outside of the top 10 for your IRA, Alto is the only option. Maybe they know that and maybe that is why they are indifferent to the terrible experience they provide"

Biggest among these is the ability to earn staking rewards.3. You also cannot move your crypto from your Coinbase account into your Alto IRA. You must first liquidate and pay taxes on the sale, then move it into the IRA. Which, if I'd known this up front, I would've set my Alto up as a Roth.I get that marketing materials are designed to get people to sign up, but things like this should definitely be clearer."

Also, you can\u2019t see what the market price is on the Algo website. You have to find another website to see what the current market price is so that you can set your limit orders.

Try reducing your magnification or accessing with different monitor/screens.This is an observation per Coinbase, not AltoIRA: The coin selection is from Coinbase and be aware it is ethereum-based.  (I noticed some exchanges favor the blockchain they're built on, such as Binance.US has more BNC/Bep20 coins). There's still 1% transaction fee. (pionex offers 0.05%, Binance.US offers 0.1%)This is an observation per CryptoIRA's in general: You will not be able to withdraw the coins for usage: eg. staking, lending, nor decentralized financing. This currently should be seen purely as a ROTH-protected trading platform with 1% trading fee."

I request Xxxx(name omitted per request of alto) multiple times to call me back, without follow through by phone most of the time. His colleague Jxxx, is very helpful though by calling me back later.  Very frustrating to have a deadline, without being able to find anyone to talk to. There was significant difference on the name of the subscriber when filling out paperwork. I feel like I\u2019m literally signing my money away to the trustee/alto which I had no experience  working with, e.g. I basically relinquished all the signing right (about nine permissions) to the CEO of alto. The bottom line is you have to trust a trustee that you have never worked with, by signing lots of document under deadline pressure. I wish I had more handholding and reassurance during this brand new process."

But, be aware they appear to be just getting their feet on the ground and patience is required.  Your deposits to your IRA must first wait to clear before they are available in AltoIRA and then there is another wait while the deposit clears in Coinbase. Also, your trades are not reported as executed in the timeframe you may be accustomed to when trading directly with Coinbase.  My last trade last night reported it was executed about 15-30 minutes after I submitted it.  Lastly, the dashboard does not show your profit/loss on any holdings.  I hope this enhancement to the dashboard is coming soon.I believe AltoIRA is a good crypto IRA product enabling investors to make profits in crypto without the worry of paying taxes on every gain.  AltoIRA is definitely worth 5 stars once they have further developed their product.  I'm very happy to have found them."

We spoke to one person who could not get us to the correct platform or simply did not understand the issue. We almost pulled all the money out of this platform and were ready to go somewhere else. However, we decided to try one last thing.We scheduled a call with another person from support. His name was Dallas and he was very helpful and fast. I had emailed him the problem the night before our call and in detail explained the issue and what I was seeing on my end. He realized what was wrong, the issue was resolved the even before our scheduled call. He also tried his best to make it so we were able to start investing in cryptoIRA that very night.Once you are correctly set up, the process for buying crypto is very easy and this part is user friendly."

The transfer of my funds into Coinbase was mysteriously cancelled on 7/22 and the funds remain unavailable. Repeated inquiries have resulted in polite, but unhelpful responses: \"I've opened a ticket\", \"We're trying to see what's going on\", etc. If I had wanted to just let my funds sit there, I could have stayed with Principal. I'm a day or two from just initiating a transfer out of AltoIRA and into any one of the many other options available out there.

Should have an option to waive that restriction. When I fund my ROTH IRA account at a brokerage firm and the funds clear in 24 hours, I can trade immediately. Also, need to have a better interface for trading cryptos. The delay in pricing information and in reporting an execution even though you are using Coinbase which replies instantly when trading directly seems unusual."

Afterwards it takes seven days before you can do anything, but then you can go and put buy orders in for what you want. I love the fact that they have so many different assets to choose from but I wish the trade fees were lower. I understand that this is supposedly a 1.5% trading fee that is charged by Coinbase, but I would think that a large firm like this could negotiate that fee down a good amount. But maybe that is how Alto makes their money on these accounts since there are no other fees. Overall I would give the service a 4 out of 5 and only say that I would like to see some lower fees. Everything else is great so far."

For market orders, fees are subtracted from the order amount which reduces the amount used to buy (I am not used to that). For limit orders, fees are not subtracted from the order amount which I like. Order history seems to keep only one line per order. Once the order is filled, the order placement history seems to be just overwritten. Most annoying is even when I am working, within short break I am timed out and have to login again. There does not seem to be any place to control that time. There is no way to see any charts. I hope more features will be added."

There were several screens to navigate and conditions to read and agree to, and the investment process took me probably about half an hour between going back and forth between the two platforms. By the next day I had conformation that the money had been sent for the investment I wanted to make. I am guessing that I will continue to pay the annual fee by credit card as long as I maintain this SDIRA. It worked for me and now I have a more diverse portfolio than I had before."
