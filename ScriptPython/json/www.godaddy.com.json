No comes the show (standard claims for renewals are refunds within 30 days, for 1-year renewals it is 45 days, but for 2 years it is 5 days) - so guess what renewal I got :P... I hoped that this wouldn't be a service where you try to milk out the customer with the fine print. And now they are not giving me back the refund due to the 3 days late (while I was even lucky to find an address on which I could make the claim). Personally opinion -  a really stupid way to break loyalty and acquire bad word of mouth."

It\u2019s absurd to me they can\u2019t tell me a date, the domain is registered to them. The domain is very bespoke and is not likely to be of interest to anyone. Just allow me to pay for it or renew it, or at least just tell me when it\u2019s back on the market. Shady business practices like this are really disappointing. Running a business is expensive enough without other business trying to extort money from you."

Today they have registered / parked the domain and want a ridiculously inflated fee for it.Any company operating this way should not be trusted with your online services or business.Wanting money for nothing...

I don't have time to wait around on hold to their call centre or wait for them to call me back.  Setting up a new email address, as a new customer, should take seconds, not over a month and two failed attempts at setting it up - which I had to do myself??  I've dealt with multiple website hosting providers in the past and nothing compares to these guys.  Absolutely useless."

          "Contenu": "As a loyal GoDaddy customer since 2007, I am deeply disheartened by the recent handling of my account. On December 15, 2023, at 7:55 PM CST, I was notified that three of my .io premium domains were removed from my account. These were part of a group of twelve domains that I have consistently bulk-renewed for the past three years. Strangely, this year, only four were auto-renewed individually, leaving the other eight, including the premium ones, unrenewed.To my dismay, two of these premium domains are now listed on GoDaddy\u2019s Afternic for substantial amounts ($5,988 and $7,880). Initially, GoDaddy attributed this issue to a billing error. However, upon consulting with PayPal, I confirmed that there were no unsuccessful payment attempts from GoDaddy. Furthermore, my PayPal account is set up with a backup payment method to ensure all charges are processed.Upon escalating this issue to GoDaddy's Level 2 support, I was informed of a \"glitch\" in their system that caused the failure in sending email notifications and another \"glitch\" preventing the billing of the eight domains. I am now being asked to repurchase my own domains at a premium price. This situation is unacceptable and has seriously eroded my trust in GoDaddy. I simply want my domains returned to me without the unfair burden of a premium price."

Can not connect Insta like I used to have it connected, can not post an update (after publishing a new article) on Facebook on google or again on instagram, and no one can find my website on Google search on images while I had hundreds of images (and being found is crucial / ex kidnap). I know GoDaddy was well intended and great in the past also, but is garbage now. I feel personally harassed bullied laughed at mocked and made to disappear from the internet at all !!! I am not even a business and they keep telling me to pay for extra things, that I never needed and don't need now. The site should just work. Thats what the site is for. I think they want to drive people to paying for free things by making sure all the free things don't work. The worst is the service, they simply hurt you till you feel it you know ? After time and time again trying I can vow, that after telling them again and again your customer number and pin and where you live and who you are, they only say \"oh I don't think you have a problem\". Time and time again. NO exceptions (oh and I was also told to not write in caps, like I was five and the teacher had a day of grandiose) Maybe some people cant read well ? I explained that but again nothing, They don't care about anything I tell you. Eve Arends"

Because my website continued to say, \"503 service error.\" Godaddy then said I needed to pay $80 for their techs to clean my site for good and I will not have any more problems with potential hacks or viruses. A few weeks later, here I am on back on the phone with godaddy, now they're saying that my included SSL Certificate does not keep my website safe from hackers and I need to purchase an additional firewall for $480 PER YEAR. That means I will pay an additional $1,440 over the next 3 years to continue my $467 package. That is the biggest bait and switch I have ever seen in my life! Literally 3 times the original agreement. Not to mention, what happened to the penny ad on their homepage??!! The supervisor then confirmed that the free SSL Certificate that was suppose to protecting the websites, were not on at least one of the websites. They would not give me a refund for my purchases and am needing a new server provider."

          "Contenu": "I do probono work with a highly reputable non-profit that was oversold services by GoDaddy when they built their site just over 3 years ago. To give some context, this small non-profit was sold a $600 3 year SSL plan (that is actually for up to 5 sites not just 1) that technically just renewed 3 days ago but she renewed it early more than 30 days ago. By paying for the renewal early, they say we are outside our window to actually move her to a smaller SSL plan that is for only 1 website. They also sold her on 2 other ala carte services and needless to say, it's just bad business. Now that I am helping her, I spent over an hour with support yesterday and then another hour today trying to find a way to fix this so she is getting the correct services long term and asked to shift her over to a managed Wordpress plan and then credit her for what she just renewed and apply it to that better plan. After going back and forth, they refuse to make this right. And for a non-profit that is all about improving mental health. It just makes me sick. I am now working on a plan to move all my clients and all my digital assets away from GoDaddy because of this. I asked them if it was worth losing a growing digital marketing agency over helping to fix this account and they just went back that it's their policy. Very very disappointed and disappointed that as a local Phoenix business (and they are based here) - that they are so cut and dry. I know policies are important but we weren't asking for money back but a credit to swap services. You'd think they see value in having a client long term with the right services for their business. But looks like they don't \"actually care about small businesses / non-profits\"."

While this might lead you to believe another customer snatched it up, Godaddy conveniently offers a broker service for $69 to secure the same domain for you.Upon purchasing this service, a twist unfolds. Godaddy returns with a surprising message, claiming they made extensive efforts but can only secure the domain for a whopping $500. It's easy to be deceived if you don't scrutinize the details carefully. Having declined this new offer, I discovered, just a few days later, a Godaddy advertisement in the exact domain I was seeking, now conveniently parked by Godaddy themselves.This experience reveals Godaddy's questionable tactics, engaging in a dubious double game and attempting to manipulate customers into paying $500 when the initial cost was meant to be a straightforward $11.99"

          "Contenu": "I have managed hosting package given to me after one of the employees messed up trying to make his commission of up-selling a product that wasn't what he said it was and causing me to lose out on a lot of money and launch of my business.i was given for the equivalent of the \u00a3600 i lost out on a package until 2026.... it was a resolution i had to bit my tongue with and accept because that was the best they could do, however it meant nothing in the end because i lost the launch of my business and things fell apart due to this. so i have taken up a new venture and tried to take advantage of the \"managed wordpress\" that i was given till 2026. but this more expensive option (because it has extra support and security than i do not need) which ultimately limits what i can do with the hosting to nearly nothing other than create a basic website with no functions such as business email, its just a package for inexperienced users to go for with extra payment walls for any other services, an its moe expensive than normal hosting on its own.I have simply asked them to swap this package for a cheaper package and they will not provide. probably because they know this more expensive option also limits certain features forcing you to pay extra monthly to godaddy...so to be clear they gave me a \"resolution\" after losing me thousands of pounds in contracts due to their mistake. and then their \"resolution\" i can't even make use of later on is worthless and they are keeping this on my account rather than swapping it out for the MUCH CHEAPER option on their side.Sounds like they are just being difficult for no reason, again when ringing customer service i have to ask them to calm down because they are once again getting rude and losing their cool and talking over me whilst i am speaking to them calm and collectively.5 months ago i rang and they said on the phone they could 100% make this change on the phone and was confirmed. i waited for a call back she said it was late and she was finishing work. i never got a call back. At least i knew for when  i needed it i could make this change and make use of what i have here. Now i fell like its just a gamble when i call up with who actually wants to help me or who is in a bad mood and can't be bothered to help."

You'd think they might try to help you but they see an opportunity to exploit.

We did not request this \"service\"! In fact, we jumped through your flaming hoops once already to remove this from our e-mail accounts\u2014at a considerable cost\u2014and as of this morning, this misbegotten would-be ransomware is baa-aaack!Imagine that someone stood in front of your home's mailbox 24 hours a day and mugged the mail carrier every time they tried to deliver your mail. \"Oh, no, you can't deliver that,\" the mugger rants.\"Pray tell why not?\" replies the mail carrier.\"Yes, do please answer that one,\" I chime in.\"Because\u2026because I said so! I don't care what's in that envelope or package. I say it's spam, so you can't have it!\"Never mind that some envelopes contain critical questions from customers who depend on me to guide them through a software onboarding process.Never mind that other envelopes contain equally important messages from colleagues.It's all spam\u2014because Proofpoint says it is.And if you want to get rid of Proofpoint? Be prepared to pay once again for all your company's e-mail addresses on the spot, and for anyone who manages their e-mail in Outlook to lose valuable messages. That charge to reconnect or reaffirm all those e-mail addresses is like paying ransom on top of all the other indignities involved.It took the head of our company HOURS on the phone with GoDaddy \"support\" to be told that we had to repurchase our entire roster of e-mail addresses\u2014and that's a completely unsatisfactory outcome. They could not fix the problem, only compound it. I don't care that someone above their pay grade refunded the charge the next day. We lost tens of thousands of dollars of worktime value to a useless, meaningless \"service\" that WE NEVER REQUESTED.If you value your time, your peace of mind, and your e-mail, DON'T USE GODADDY for your e-mail provider.And I can't even use my company e-mail address to submit this review because Proofpoint is blocking all my e-mail and Trustpilot needs a 2FA code they sent to that address.

Unfortunately, my encounter revealed a darker side to their operations \u2013 a blatant disregard for customer trust and outright theft.Despite the promises of transparency and fair dealings, GoDaddy has engaged in what can only be described as stealing from its users. I discovered unauthorized charges on my account, cleverly disguised under vague terms and hidden in the fine print. It's disheartening to see a company resorting to such underhanded tactics to bolster its profits.Customer service, or lack thereof, only compounded my frustration. Attempts to resolve the issue were met with indifference and a dismissive attitude. It's clear that GoDaddy prioritizes its bottom line over the well-being of its customers, leaving them feeling betrayed and taken advantage of.In an era where trust is paramount in online transactions, GoDaddy's actions are not only unethical but also damaging to its reputation. I strongly caution anyone considering their services to think twice before entrusting their business or personal endeavors to a company that resorts to stealing from its own users."

A small task such as setting up the website security SSL took over 4 months, and they were still unable to fix it. This was a product purchased directly from godaddy. They then later said it was seperate from the SSL certificate required to get HTTPS for your website. It wasnt. Just, poorly informed and poor technical staff, and potentially trying to get you to spend more money.Recently, my godaddy account experienced a security breach, whereby a random hacker was able to log in to my account, delete my primiary user name and change my password, all without notifying me at all. (i have done a full sweep of my security devices and no malware present). furthemore, this was right after we changed our password 2 days before.Attempting to recover the account was another nightmare. Horrible customer service who give very scripted replies, saying they understand, but really...they have no freaking clue! the account recovery team which was suppose to be available 24/7 only responded once at day. Despite the fact that I have made it blatantly clear this was a major security issues that would affect all 3 of my businesses. They really didnt give a damn.The last straw, i recieved a reply from the account recovery team, 6 hours after my last message providing verification documents (just 2 mins after recieving their email response). The told me the request to disable my two-factor verification is successful. Now why would someone who just had their account hack, be trying to remove their 2 factor verification. literally, the last method of protecting his account? Godaddy logic is guess. They ended off with it seems like you have gotten your account back. feel free to contact them for any further queries.Now this is despite multiple calls, whatsapp messages and emails requesting for them to disable the account preventing the hacker from taking any more action."

Disappointed that GD does not have a more modern system to allow me to at least get logged in (modern websites use a simple mechanism called a \"one time code\" to prevent this very issue) while they figure out the issue. I'm rating 1 star because I can't believe that the infrastructure is so bad that one day you can't log in and there is nothing meaningful they can do about it. The only benefit from this experience is that my boss finally gave me permission to move all of our domains to a more capable and responsive hosting company. Assuming I am even able to log in at some point in the next 24 to 72 hours. Very frustrating."

I contacted GoDaddy via their chat service and was shuttled from one agent to another. While they were helpful, the chat times were long, punctuated with repeated requests for account validation and numbers to call. One agent I spoke with on the phone (where I was put on long holds) informed me that the refund requests had been processed and that I would receive email confirmations within a few hours. By EOB I had not received any emails. The last time I contacted them I was yet again made to contact several agents where I finally received part of the refund, one of which was incorrectly made out to store credit. A final call put things right and I received the refund requests. When i spoke with a supervisor i was informed the reason for the delay might be due to the amount and that they did not know why they weren't originally processed. There was too much time wasted and a process that should have been efficient (within policy and confirmed repeatedly) need not have gone through so many iterations. I\u2019ve given the review 2 stars because the agents were responsive and I think the issue is an internal one. So double check your refund requests from GoDaddy!"

The techs were world class and made you feel like helping the customer was top priority. But in recent years, it's very sales oriented. While you'll still get a stellar rep occasionally, it's usually hard to get sincere, dedicated tech support from the front line customer support techs. The conversation is almost continually being routed toward trying to make a sale-regardless of the problem you're needing help with. I don't blame them though-it's a company thing. Perhaps going public wasn't good for GoDaddy?"

          "Titre": "Sales reps disguised as Customer Service reps...",
          "Contenu": "It appears that Godaddy sales reps are disguising themselves as customer service reps to take advantage of unsuspecting customers! Everytime I call Godaddy for a service issue, they try to sell me a new product, whether I need it or not! I am aware that \"customer service reps\" make a commission for each product they sell if you call with a product or service related problem, so there is a financial incentive for their recommendation. That is a conflict of interest in my opinion. Customer service reps have a profit motive with each call.  For example, one of my sites needed a security certificate that originated at Godaddy but was being managed by WIX. I bought the security certificate only to find out since the site was managed by WIX, the certificate I purchased was worthless. Since I discovered this more than 30 days from purchasing the certificate, Godaddy refused to give me a refund and offered me a credit, after an intense conversation.I then agreed to use the credit to transfer the site back to Godaddy from WIX for web hosting only to find out that I could not transfer my site from WIX back to GoDaddy because they use two different website builders. I would have to rebuild the site from scratch at an additional cost from Godaddy. So the $215 credit for a security certificate that was to be used for hosting is a loss, even though the sales rep rep knew exactly what I was trying to do. I hope he was able to buy lunch with his commission!Recently I received a message on my desktop that MS Outlook for one of my email address linked to my national company was running out of storage and was 91% full. When I clicked the low storage notification link, it took me to MS Outlook on the web that said I was only using 29% storage for that email address. Godaddy allocates 50 GB of storage but Microsoft allocates 100 GB of email storage. I called Godaddy to find out why one said I used 91% and MS said I used 29% for the same email address.Turns out, I have two identical email addresses on the same domain (what?!). The one managed by Godaddy that is set at 50 GB was 91% full, but the second email address with MS Outlook personal account was only at 29%. One was created by Godaddy and one was apparently created by me. I asked the rep to simply switch the Godaddy managed email address to the server for the personal email address since I had an additional 50BG available for the exact same email address. The rep said she could but wanted to charge me $260+ for the \"upgrade\". Naturally I refused! This is their mindset. Godaddy saw another opportunity to sell me something I already owned! I have been a 15 year loyal customer but my  $215 unused credit wasn't enough!In my opinion, this is an unethical business model that is driving away customers like me to their competition. Bottom line is, I will not be registering any new domains with Godaddy. If I could move the domains I currently own, I would. Sad to see a good company go down this dead end road!"

I asked to talk to the next tier support - they outright refused and told me that I don't have the issue that I told them I had.

The only pleasant experience that I have ever had with with any of their people was with a girl named Freya last nite. She was friendly ,polite professional and helped me resolve my issue at least for the short term . Godaddy needs to promote her and have her train their CSR staff. Unfortunately, I don't think even she can change the culture at GoDaddy by herself. It's a nice thought though.

GoDaddy refused to conduct an audit trail to determine those details. Customer service reps and a supervisor spouted ad hoc security policies that \"prevent GoDaddy from sharing those details.\" Just fess up, GoDaddy!  I'm off to find a more transparent registrar.==============Update, May 30, 2023.I received an email reply from an individual who manages customer reviews for GoDaddy. This representative performed the exact steps I had requested 4 days earlier (an audit trail of DNS settings) & successfully found the issues. Great response from GoDaddy, but no explanation for the previous poor customer service was offered.  Revised from one to two stars."

The expectation of timely service is fundamental, and this repeated delay is unacceptable.I kindly request that this issue be resolved urgently. If not addressed promptly, I feel compelled to share my experience on platforms like Trustpilot to inform others of this recurring problem.Thank you for your attention to this matter.Sincerely,Fatih Alemdar *** The problem is solved, but Domian always activates late."

You don't find out there is another tier you have to pay for until after you've already bought the initial website package. It's probably in the \"small print,\" but no one reads \"small print\", and Godaddy knows that. It feels like you've been tricked into buying an inferior product at that point. It's incredibly unethical and immoral to run a company like that.    You get 3/5 stars because I love the 1st tier product and can make it work for my purposes.

Turns out the problem was very simple to solve but was created by the bad instructions I got in an email from GoDaddy. They migrated me to a new IP address (because at GoDaddy, if it ain't broke, they \"fix\" it anyway) and in a DIY email, they instructed me to only clear my cache if my content had changed. I hadn't changed one letter of content, so I skipped that step. Apparently, skipping that step is what made my website invisible to the public. The last person I spoke to was efficient, polite and solved my problem, but the overall experience was not positive - at all!"

While I did eventually get to a real person (thanks), after dealing with 5 automated systems with various vendors today, I'm just done with not being able to talk with a real person. Lots of companies like to use FAQ pages and I find that, more often than not, the answer to the question I have is not on those pages. So I HAVE to phone and go through automated menu hell. Go Daddy was unfortunately the 6th today and my patience was at an end.  I will say that Go Daddy's automated menus were shorter than most so thanks for that! I was able to reach a real person in about 3 minutes versus most automated systems where I either can't reach a real person at all (don't get me started on a recent airline issue), or I'm on hold/call back waiting for multiple hours."

My company liveshop.direct [SaaS] provides customer service software and I took positives from the 45 min call that will be used for our on boarding client acquisition process, the Go-daddy cust service rep bent over backwards to sort this out, and because of that, I felt compelled to spend $500 immediately on domains. I am also very impressed with their scale of cust service reps that are all over the world. for example the guy I dealt with lives in Peru, which means he can earn 4 times above the national salary average in his country, and I will also replicate elements of this model to acquire field/digital HR in south america to push our brand out there. I am not getting paid for this review, give props when a major player does it right and continues to get it right. their only Achilles heel is when they reach a saturation point of how big is too big to manage!? great problem to have.
