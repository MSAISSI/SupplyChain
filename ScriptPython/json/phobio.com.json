          "Contenu": "A ridiculous 2 week time limit that no company has to send a phone in and they expect you not to have a life or be 100% perfect when again, no other company does this. They also count the time that package even gets to you as part of the 2-week time limit. This company is shady and should go out of business for having such a dumb rule and even worse customer service.12/13/23 reply:That is a lie; even if those companies do have that policy, what they don't have is horrible customer service when a person DOES make a mistake. They also have a PHONE NUMBER to call and not an email that gets little to no replies to customer concerns. I sent my device in within the time frame but I had a small mistake that I corrected right away. It was YOUR CRAPPY CUSTOMER SERVICE that was the main concern that refused to grant me an extension FOR 2 WEEKS AFTER THE FACT!!! I am not in doubt about your \"terms and service\" I am in doubt about your horrible company that doesn't know how to run itself properly.Update reply 12/18/23:No, that is a lie. You refused after making me play \"phone tag\" by telling me to call Motorola. I spent 2 WEEKS arguing back and forth with whoever it was I emailing. This is especially true since I was told that it can be extended \"for certain circumstances\". Stop trying to defend your HORRIBLE customer service. As more proof of your HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I emailed you 2 weeks ago about the money and STILL NO RESPONSE but you have time (within 3 days) to reply to your bad reviews. If find that hilarious that reviews get faster response time then your NONEXSITANT customer service email."

I did an overnight turn and had the return box to UPS October 23 at 10:24am. Today is 13 Novemeber, 21 days after return box was dropped off at UPS. Still do NOT have Costco credit.

Secondly, I requested a new shipping label through their \u201cdashboard\u201d and got no response. Repeating request didn\u2019t help until I contacted Costco customer service to complain and then finally I received a new shipping label by email. Thirdly, they docked the estimated value of my trade-in for two erroneous reasons. One reason was because they received my trade-in \u201clate\u201d (due to the shipping label fiasco, which was THEIR FAULT), and secondly because the exact model of my trade-in didn\u2019t match what I had put into their form due to there not being an exact match available. In fact, the machine I traded in was BETTER than what I had specified, not worse. Again, this was their fault. I explained that situation through their dashboard again, and again with no response. I also found a customer service phone number for them on their website, but the number responds with a computer that says they don\u2019t take customer service calls over the phone and to send email instead. Sending them email also gets no response. The worst customer service I\u2019ve ever seen. Costco should drop them as a partner IMMEDIATELY.Note: If Phobio replies to this review with some offer to help, it\u2019s WAY TOO LATE--they should have responded to the multiple requests I made to their customer service at the time when I needed help."

Phone sent back on Dec 9. Received a note from Phobio on Dec 21 that my trade in was cancelled. After many emails, they had the audacity to state they cancelled my trade in because was late by 6 days. What??? Trade in is 21 days from when I received the box, on December 8. I guess Phobio people missed the math classes, or they had none. This is not a business. Check the number of complaints with Better Business Bureau and the investigations within their business.

There is no guidance on the Phobio site for how this might affect the value.  Regardless, I am changing the stars from 1 to 2 because they returned the charger.Original review:Phobio offered me less than half of the original offer when they received my computer, so I declined the offer.  This was insulting, but to be expected.  I received my computer back after declining their adjusted offer, but Phobio did not include the charger I sent with the item.  They returned a MacBook charger with a spot for a USB-C cable (without any cable), rather than the original MagSafe adapter I sent with it, and this charger is not compatible with the computer.  This is a different kind of charger entirely from the one that the 2015 MacBooks came with.  Now I have a computer with no charger that I would like to sell but will need to buy a charger to go with it."

Got an email saying they were revising my quote to $0 because the device didn't turn on. I contacted customer service and contested this as it turned on fine when I sent it to them. They said my options were accept $0, or they would send it back. I had them send it back, and, low and behold, it turned on right out of the box. I immediately called Phobio support and was asked to send a photo of the working screen to an email that was provided. I am currently waiting on a response to my photo. Perhaps they will make it right in the end, but if you send a machine to them that was working and they tell you it isn't when they review it, make sure you ask them to send the device back."

That said, my previously trade in with them through Apple (Dec 2020), who uses Phobio, I received only 25% the amount I was quoted.  The iPhone I sent in was in great condition but the first time I sent it in, they said the \"Display has 3 or more white spots\", so I took it back because there were no issues with the screen. The second time I sent it in, they said the \"Camera is not functioning properly\".  Apparently the screen healed itself and now there was a different issue ... which of course was not the case because there was nothing wrong with the camera.  I am not the only who experience this too and Verge even wrote an article on it.So Phobio gets 3 stars because I'm still not sure what to expect of them.

They attached a blurry photo that doesn\u2019t reflect the condition I sent it in. Absolutely terrible. Such a scam. My options are take some money or get a laptop back that didn\u2019t have the damage they claim when I sent it in.UPDATE: I reached out to the email address and they did respond and give me the additional $310 I was quoted. I appreciate their attempt to fix it but perhaps need to work on their internal mechanisms so people don't think they're being ripped off."

So far my experience is 1 star. I would be happy to bump it up to 5 stars if I could just get a response from customer service. I tried using the support portal, \"live\" chat (it says its not currently live 'today' due to a 'holiday'... it's said that for a week), and today I emailed 'daisyq' directly. My issue is that I did a trade in in July 2021 for two apple devices, with an expected credit on an apple gift card. I received the link to my credits but never clicked them because it said \"click to redeem\".. to me that meant to redeem/spend the apple credit so I never tried clicking it until I went to go buy a new iphone last week. When I tried the links then I got a message that said the credit has expired. I am hoping this means that the link has expired, and not the actual credit, because never once during the process was I told that the apple gift card would have an expiration date. If it just that the link expires, I would really appreciate a response and that they can turn the link back on for me to use. If Phobio can't make it right in that way then I will absolutely keep this a 1 star review, as I am currently out $200 dollars in money I was promised."

          "Contenu": "This was a very easy way to recycle my old iPhone when I upgraded and get some extra money for groceries. I never know what to do with my old phones so I usually try to trade them in. This time, I upgraded with my carrier and did not have that option. Phobio brought me through an easy online process to choose my phone and the model. Then they asked some very simple questions about what condition my phone was in. They gave me an estimate (more on this later) of what they believed my phone would be worth. I agreed to their estimate and their terms and they sent me a box in the mail. The small box already has a return label inside so I did not have to pay for shipping. I followed the instructions and brought my package to USPS. When they received my phone, they changed their estimate. While I answered all the questions correctly (the phone can turn on, it works and charges fine and the screen is not cracked) they found some dead pixels I never noticed and said there was some wear and tear from dust. This brought my estimate from $150 to $70. They gave me the option to have my phone returned to me for free. Having no use for the phone anyway, I decided to accept the $70. Since I did this through Costco, Phobio sent me a Costco gift card in the mail. The entire process only took about two weeks. Overall, I am very happy and will use this service again in the future!"
