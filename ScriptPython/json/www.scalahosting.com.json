Have you seen our great \"how to\" writeup on that at http://blahblahblah?\" And the reason they can't do that is there isn't one. Wix and other similar service providers have great articles and videos on for example hosting with ScalaHosting while you keep your domain name and email somewhere else. Scala just wants you to switch everything to them ($$$) and are not helpful with other scenarios. Bad on them."

Their support is efficient at resolving and responding to ticket very fast.But I had to leave when the refused downgrade migration. They demanded I pay $40 and later $20 to migrate my sites to a lower plan. But they migrate free if I was transferring from a different hosting or upgrading. I suppose they do this to prevent customers from downgrading but that's a dumb move because they will end up losing customers that would have stayed loyal for years on a plan they can afford. They forget their price is high and there are competitions with far less prices and efficiency than them. My sites weren't earning so downgrading was necessary for me. If they ever change this policy in future, I will return."

This has undoubtedly contributed to a positive user experience for my visitors.3.Customer Support: I've had a few technical queries along the way, and the customer support team at ScalaHosting has been a great help. They respond promptly, and their representatives are knowledgeable and friendly.4.Easy-to-Use Control Panel: The control panel is user-friendly, making it easy to manage my website settings, domains, and other features. Even for someone who's not tech-savvy, navigating the control panel is a breeze.Cons:Pricing: While the service quality is excellent, the pricing is slightly on the higher side compared to some competitors. However, considering the reliability and features they offer, I believe it's worth the investment.Overall, I'm quite satisfied with my experience with ScalaHosting.

This would help retain them and gain an advantage over those competitors who offer incentives to leave Scala. Valentin was able to help, after a long chat session, and we are now happy to stay with Scala. The 24/7 online chat support made the difference between staying with Scala and leaving to one of their competitors."

They patiently imparted knowledge and extended their assistance to issues that extended beyond their immediate responsibilities. It was not just about fixing problems; it was about empowering me to navigate the hosting landscape with confidence.SPanel Game-Changer: Innovation in ActionWhen cPanel's licensing became a hurdle, Scala Hosting responded with SPanel \u2013 a game-changer that not only matched cPanel's features but surpassed them. The support team showcased their commitment to innovation by manually implementing a solution for a missing feature, demonstrating their dedication to ensuring their services evolve to meet user needs.The Inbox Chronicles: 778 Emails and Still SmilingWith 778 emails exchanged, a significant portion being support tickets, Scala Hosting has consistently demonstrated unwavering dedication to fulfilling my demands.

          "Contenu": "Great! The representative was very good and very knowledgeable.Follow up to my previous review...I intended to came here on this Trustpilot site not to add a rating or withdraw a rating I had previously given. Because my experience in my previous inquiry was that the representative answered my questions well. What I lost on my previous inquiry is I had misinterpreted their product offering, especially the premium features they claim. That is what I want to make an emphasis it now.In fact, they offer no Free Domain or Real Time Malware Protection. Even the other Hosting companies that sell this type of product. Check and think carefully about what they say the Free Domain of their current price now with the premium features they offered. Ask how much the price will be after the renewal rate upfront for 1 year if you intended it for a year only.I purchased from ScalaHosting their product WP Start with the amount price of $5.95/mo the total amount for 1 year is $71.40. I think I got that the less price, but the whole thing was that it didn't have the features. They just subtract all its features, and they do as a feature for their premium price. If you can't check the true price the trick there is you will go after the product because of the features, the Free Domain and Real Time Malware Protection, and this is indeed I fall into my wrong interpretation.Regularly, the price of WP Start after renewal is $11.95/mo the total amount for 1 year is $143.40. It probably includes what they say is Free Domain and Malware Protection. If you do the computation of the full total price for 1 year of WP Start product, there is really NO Free Domain and Malware Protection as they claimed in their promo. That's just only part of their marketing strategy to get more sales.Even the other hosting companies that sell this type of product the kind of features they offer really don't exist. Since, I just started with ScalaHosting, let's just see their hosting performance if it's good before the end of the month comes. And I hope I'm not wrong in my choice of choosing ScalaHosting."
