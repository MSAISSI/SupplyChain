          "Contenu": "Multiple places on the website say their locations can be used for business registration (with a state), but that is not true. And, you have to buy it before you find out this is false. They don't inform you upfront which locations do not, nor do they post a disclaimer, nor do they provide a phone number to contact the location to determine if they are registered as a PMB in the state. Wasted a lot of time on this. Rep told me I'm not the only one who calls in about this, so clearly they don't care they mislead people."

However, the situation changed when they started to delay scanning items, and my mail was not being sent out promptly. Moreover, some of my mail started getting lost, which was a major concern, especially when it involved my business checks. Ipostal claimed that the missing items were not in their possession, and the shipping providers couldn't help either as they never received the mail. This is affecting my business significantly, and I can't afford to keep losing my business checks or to be on top of the mail when I have a business to run. I was okay with paying the fees and dealing with late scans. The lost checks are unacceptable. As a result, I am currently looking for a new business mailbox service provider because they are unreliable.NY location Staples 5th Avenue 10018"

This behavior can be perceived as gaslighting, as they fail to take responsibility for their actions and provide adequate customer service.Update (December 15, 2023):iPostal1 has contacted me by email, providing extensive information about pricing. However, I am disappointed that they did not offer any solutions to assist with my lost packages. As a result, I intend to maintain my negative review until my packages are located. Additionally, there are concerns that they attempt to suppress legitimate negative reviews on Trustpilot. Therefore, I would advise against engaging with this company, as they may not encourage open and honest feedback from their customers."

It was not accepted, and they sent instructions for the form. It was done correctly and notarized again. I used the email feature, not the website. Then I was not notified that they refused to approve the ID docs. That was NEVER THE CASE!!!! They then began sending repeated emails that they needed the form filled out properly and my form matched their request.  I sent an email asking they look at their request and look at the form and to call me because clearly it was correct to their specifications. Nobody called. Long and short of it was in the end.. they had what they asked me for when I uploaded it with a link they sent the first time. They couldn't or didn't upload it from their end. I was requested to upload again while on the phone with the 3rd person I was pawned to trying to resolve this. I showed her the document was the same as before and was now there twice, but she was able to approve it immediately.  Ipostal has an entire department and a link and a \"form team\" for this one document because their site is complicated. They have contracts with stores to receive the mail and these stores can't do much, but they said they take a lot of complaints.  I spent far too much time getting tossed between staples and ipostal to find that a call back could have saved me two weeks of frustration. The only reason I keep it is because I began using the address and don't have time to start over."

If I get an address at UPS Store  for example, they don't have a 'pickup' change. They would expect, as most would, you would get shipments in, that is obvious.My main point is the deceptive way this charge is applied. After searching for 15 minutes on the iPostal1 site, I finally found this verbiage, \"Some locations charge a small pickup fee.\" Well nice to know now, I already paid a year in advance. I didn't know this when I signed up.  Which locations? Tell me so I can avoid those. Small pickup fee?  How small? It seems they can charge what they want, because I don't know in advance what the fee is going to be.  How am I supposed to make an informed decision?  I have been with the service for less than two weeks, so there is a hidden, secret way to get out of this, please let me know - this is really a deception.\"Details on pickup fees are available by each address listing.\"  You will not see these details unless you click on a greyed-out button; important cost details are hidden when they do not need to be hidden, it's literally two lines of text which takes up the same space as the greyed-out 'More Details' button."

I'd thought iPostal1.com was competitive and transparent in this industry as advertised. Instead they started charging my account crazy fees without disclosure in any invoice.I was charged $21 to forward a 3 pounds package to a US domestic address using USPS. I was charged after I selected the rate to ship the package. It wasn't an international address...Nonsense!I hope they can start disclosing Clear Pricing and total cost w/ rates before charging my account. A breakdown invoice should be disclosed before authorization.I did send an email to support about this issues, no answer at this point. It was more than one occasion where hidden fees were charged AFTER I selected the forwarding rate(below $10.00). As per your request here is one of the transactions numbers: M10981 Invoice 15658464 under druiz. I did email support via the contact us page without an answer. Next time you decide to flag your own customers answer your customers emails looking for support.

Ok, whatever, I placed an order to have both letters forwarded to me in another state.  Their system said no charge.  I thought that was odd.

I don't think the service is worth it.  $40+ each month just for the address, $3+ to auto scan letters (even if you do not request this service), $1+ to pick up your letter etc... Hire an attorney to handle your business correspondence, it's cheaper and you have legal representation/privacy."

That's $4.50 to read a single sensitive letter. The monthly service is advertised in BIG BOLD LETTERS $9.99 PER MONTH.

I don't understand why it took 5 months to track down my mail with no assistance from iPostal1?  With no account services available until September, a refund was not granted. I paid for 12 months service and only received mail service for 6 months with mail being held. I do not recommend this mail forwarding service. iPostal1 does not have a committed customer service ethic. This was a natural disaster that hopefully this company can use to improve their services.Update:  location was Shawnee Oklahoma 2023 at the Staples location on Kickapoo Street.  Exact Tornado date unsure but spring of 2023. I hope this helps in your investigation. Thank you!"

All the thin envelopes and junk mail shows up, but any envelopes that contain anything a little thick like credit cards, gift cards etc always get stolen. Anything that the size or packaging suggests that something inside is something of value, it gets stolen. Use of the tracking numbers shows successful deliveries are made, but they get mysteriously misplaced after that. If you\u2019re thinking about signing up for this address iPostal service, just don\u2019t. There\u2019s no security for any of your mail, just use another service!"

In the setup of our service with iPostal1, we took our signed and notarized Form 1583 and our IDs to the store where the employee took it and spent time on his computer, then returned and said we were all set up.Later that day we logged into the iPostal1 app only to find we were not set up, that we had not submitted the required  documents. During an online chat with iPostal1, we were told that the store was not set up to approve our documents, that we would have to send them to iPostal1 and they would  in turn, forward them to the main Staples for approval and it would take up to 3 days. We did what they said to do and do now have an account properly set up with them.2. Two packages arrived at the Staples store where iPostal1 is in Sierra Vista, We had tracked them with USPS tracking numbers. Twenty-four hours later we had still not been notified of their arrival. We went to the store, and the employee had to look for the packages in the back where they had not even been processed. They took pictures of the packages, handed them to us, and had us sign for them.Later that day we found a $2.00 charge from iPostal1 for a \"Scheduled pickup.\" We were never informed there would be a charge, and this pickup was definitely not scheduled.We are unhappy with iPostal1 and how this was all handled. They are using a location and employees who are not efficient or capable of properly handling the service for iPostal1.UPDATE: As a response to iPostal1's reply... I have no issue scheduling a pickup. I have a big issue when waiting over 24 hours for the packages to show in my account so I can schedule the pickup. I am still waiting for another package to be entered into the system  Timeliness is everything, especially when a customer has paid for Overnight,  Priority, or Express packages."

I believe iPostal1 tried to rectify the past issues by not charging these 2 new letters to be sent to me. I'm still wary about the consistency, but it's appreciated it. I'll update if I receive anything else.EDIT:08/21/23 RE-EDIT:8/22/23 gotten my mail twice in a row now, but I thought the UI was bugging out.

          "Contenu": "I have had an account with iPostal1 for a number of years. The service started out ok and everything was fine, but the store being used for my address apparently changed hands and things are not so smooth any more. The new owners are less efficient, less conscientious and the employees are not helpful. I have now had call them directly 3 or 4 times with no results.  Had a recent problem with their billing system that should have been cleared up quickly, but it took days to straighten out because the iPostal1 website was not working properly and I was told they have no IT department. The only department that answers the phone is Sales. The only real customer service and support is by 'Chat' as it is extremely difficult to get anyone from iPostal1 'customer service' main office in New York to answer the phone. Even chat usually has a long wait. All this to see one's mail? When I first considered which company to use, I called their main 800 support number and it was fairly easy to reach--good service. Now, iPostal1 only has support from 9am to 5pm EST on weekdays. Many of the customers live internationally so this is a hassle if there is a problem. It seems that the company has gone downhill service-wise in the last year. I read a review that said iPostal1 had great service 24/7! I can only assume the reviewer was confused. Ipostal1 has no 24/7 service service options. Even 'Chat' is only available 9am to 5pm EST on weekdays. I really do not want to have to change my address, but I am now quite nervous about my mail being handled by this company. They do not monitor the stores carefully enough and they do not seem to understand that US mail is very important to customers. A letter scan that I requested 5 days ago still has not been done. For the amount customers pay iPostal1, the service should be much better and their stores should be more efficient. This company will tell you they care about the customers, but they do not act like it."

Then they started charging my card for me picking up my mail (after I paid for the membership). I found some charges on my credit card, and then they admitted their policy had changed, although they never notified me to see if I was happy to continue with the new charges.They also require me to schedule a time that I want to pick up, but when I arrive they never have anything ready. So I schedule, then stand around for 10 minutes waiting for them to locate my mail.Once I scheduled, then arrived to collect my mail. I was there for almost half an hour while they looked all over for a missing package. Finally they asked me to come back later to collect it, so they had additional time to locate it. I got in the car and left and they called me 5 minutes later to tell me they finally found it. So I had to drive back and find parking to get it. I\u2019m now paying a friend to receive my mail and cancelling with iPostal1.***Nice that they responded here, but no follow up as promised. Went in to collect my last mail from the physical location and had to stand there wait while the girl was sitting on the computer instead of preparing my scheduled pickup. Goodbye iPostal1."

          "Contenu": "Problem solved! They sent me messages to apologize and reimbursed the notary fess. I appreciate that they take accountability for issues coming from them. ThanksUPDATE!!! It's SCAM!!!!THE BIGGEST SCAM OF THE CENTURY! Hidden fees!!!These guys are just after honest people money.This is a complete garbage, well organized scam. This is not a professional mailing company. They have no control over mail centers they claim as partner. I subscribed since the beginning of August and was charged for it as well as the notarize form which costs $25. waste of money and time because my account has been pending approval since August 7 till today 09/02. It stated pending approval from the mail center itself, so as long as the mail center doesn't give approval, your account stay inactive and useless. I have been calling them and messaging them multiple time but they just ignore the problem. It really upset me since they never called me after multiple attempt to find a solution. They take no responsibility over issues and they don't care about you after you pay for the fees. They never returned my calls and messages even though I called them to complain not once but 10+ time. I remember my last call on Aug 28, when I got my call transferred to at least 7 people saying \" would you please hold on, I will transfer you to someone who can help\". When I ask how to cancel and get refund for my $9.99 mail subscription + $25 notarization, I was told only the mail center fees are refundable. Meaning I will loose $25 for nothing. Waste of time an money. As of today, no-one called me or messaged me for an update. No fix at all. NOT WORTH IT!This is a scam and I hope people won't get fooled. It's a well organized scam, so don't fall for it.PS: It's easy to talk to someone on the phone when you dial 1 as a new customer. Existing customers calls get rejected and they just redirect you to email them or use the chat box where you just get automatic responses.This is the worse experience ever and it's ridiculous how they treat customers."

I'm still waiting on my refund but I'm satisfied with history handled the issue.END UPDATE I haven't used the service in over a year because I found another option. I just took the loss on the first year because I wasn't sure if I would still need it later or not.It came time for renewal but my card on file expired so that couldn't auto-renew, so I figured that problem would take care of itself, but no. Somehow they managed to charge my new card without my having updated any information with them.Realizing this, I logged into my portal to resolve the issue. I called the customer service number listed, only to be kicked out of the portal and greeted by one of the rudest customer facing people I have encountered. I found out this is Mr. Shipper is Del Rae Beach, and he's not even the right place for me to call. He's the service provider for the address but cannot not do anything related to the account. His demeanor on the phone suggests that he doesn't care about the customer service end of his job. He did provide me with another number to call.I logged back into my account to submit a ticket, only to be kicked of my portal a second time!I called the other number the rude service agent at Mr. Shipper gave me and never got a hold of anyone. After answering their automated questions and waiting for 5 minutes, I was told to leave a message.Based on the other reviews this experience seems to be the exception, or maybe it's the new way they're doing business. Either way, it's been a terrible experience and as of yet, I have had no success in getting recourse for what I consider a fraudulent charge and a terrible customer experience."

It's very convenient not having to drive to a P.O. box. I can read the mail online or have it forwarded if I don't want it to be opened. I recommend for those reason if you need privacy and convenience. For my particular needs though it was a great service Ipostal1 doesn't meet my particular needs. I wasn't expecting a Private mail box number to be apart of the address line I wish that was advertised up front. The addresses might be good for registering a company but opening a bank account, establishing business credit and a credit business location can pose a problem. Fortunately for me was able to get these issues fictional by obtaining a virtual office, but using Ipostal1 initially resulted in spending more money and time to get things done right for my particular circumstances. I still use it but as mailing address for customers if they need to write or if I need to mail them."
