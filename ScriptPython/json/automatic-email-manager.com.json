I had to go through each rule that was imported from version 6 (we had 23 rules running) and edit the folder to look in, the folder to move to, and the fields to use when saving the files.  It was as if I had to create all new rules anyway. And I do not like the group actions feature, it feels like duplicate work now for administrating the rules.Oh and I forgot to mention that all the rules were updated with the \"live push\" option, which severely compromised our computer that runs the software.  I hope that was mentioned in the \"new features\" information that I missed. Thank you!"

Yes, we have found bugs in AEM and Namtuk has quickly fixed the issues or explained my misunderstanding, normally by the next day. If the error hard to reproduce, they have worked with us until the issue is resolved.I can remember at least three times that Namtuk has taken a suggestion of mine and added it for everyone in AEM by the next day! Wow!!! (Of course, your mileage my vary.)  Do I recommend Namtuk and AEM: YES! I also like that AEM is readily available to trial for a 30-day trial and their pricing is upfront.
