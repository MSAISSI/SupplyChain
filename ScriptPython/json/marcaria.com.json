Most of them turned out fine, but for the New Zealand TM, they registered it under the wrong name and address!! They told me it would get fixed shortly...It's been almost a year, and now when i ask when it's going to get fixed, I don't hear back from them. No reply, no follow up...nothing...Considering I've spent more than $20K in registration costs, this is pretty unacceptable. And to ignore their own customer when it was 100% their fault?! Take your money elsewhere, as there are plenty of other options out there for a cheaper price and will at the least follow up with you when it was their mistake."

There's no way to update the case unless&until they send you an email on it. The email contains case links that don't work for you, even if you're logged into their site.In response to the issues I've had (above) I do not get a sense that they are fixing the root causes of the failures."

          "Titre": "Be careful when paying with PayPal",
          "Contenu": "I have ordered a bunch (around 50) domains for a new TLD registration three weeks ago. When paying with PayPal the process got stuck. A few hours before the new TLDs got open for public registration I wanted to buy them for registration. (Marcaria offers a reservation service, they try to get the domains as soon they get open for registration).I paid around $900 via PayPal but the domains still remained in the cart and I got no order confirmation.Because I did not want to miss out on these domains I got them from another provider and asked for a refund from Marcaria. So I paid a total of $1800 for the names.Marcaria \"offers\" a Livechat function on their support site which is broken. The Livechat-Button doesn't even work, so I opened a ticket and opened PayPal disputes. The customer service then told me they can not refund the money as long the PayPal disputes are opened and asked me to close them, which I did not because I would lose the PayPal protection.They even told me they had a phonecall with PayPal and that it would be fine if I close the disputes, they told me I could reopen the dispute anytime which is not true. Once a PayPal dispute is closed it cannot be opened by the buyer.I had a phone call with PayPal on this topic myself and got told not to close the disputes until I receive my refunds. Marcaria could refund the money at any time while the disputes were open.So Marcaria and I could not find a solution without PayPal. I then had to wait for two weeks until PayPal got into the case and resolved the dispute for us.Knowing I would win the dispute since no domains were delivered I waited for PayPal\u00b4s solution.But then PayPal decided to only refund one of in total three disputes in my favor!Marcaria won the case and got to keep over $830.Knowing this could not be right I called PayPal again and told them the situation, they then reopened the disputes and today after 21 days of pure stress I got my money back!So be cautious when paying with PayPal and do not rely on PayPal to close the disputes in your favor!Update from 1-Star rating to 3-Star: Marcaria lately called me and explained the whole situation to me. Unfortunately there was a uncommon error during the payment process and Marcaria is now investigating it together with PayPal. Marcaria told me they are working hard to improve their processes and the amount of 5-Star ratings here on Trustpilot shows, that my experience was an isolated case. Marcaria generously offered to compensate me for this unfavorable situation."

          "Contenu": "The attention I received from the agent was fine. She followed up with the appropriate teams to get a definitive answer, which is absolutely her job and she did it perfectly.So, to be clear, it is not on her that I didn't _get_ a definitive answer. I'm happy with the result that you should not expect a forwarding rule to forward an email _back_ to the address that it came from.But, this should be stated clearly in the documentation, both that available to the user and agents. Although it's reasonable to assume that such 'bounceback' forwarding would never be needed in practice, it is _also_ reasonable to assume that a new, non-commercial domain owner (like me) might try it as a test, and that possibility could easily be confirmed or eliminated in the support script.Here is how the conversation should have gone:[Agent] (Mon, 10/12/2020, 05:10:22 pm America/Santiago)Hello. How may I help you?Me (Mon, 10/12/2020, 05:11:05 pm)Hey, I have set up mail forwarding for an email on my new domain, but it isn't happening ... what could I have done wrong?[Agent]  (Mon, 10/12/2020, 05:11:18 pm)What is your domain name?Me (Mon, 10/12/2020, 05:11:28 pm)[my domain name][Agent]  (Mon, 10/12/2020, 05:11:43 pm)Let me check. Just a second.Me (Mon, 10/12/2020, 05:11:50 pm)Tx[Agent]  (Mon, 10/12/2020, 05:15:19 pm)Did you create a forwarding to [some email address]?Me (Mon, 10/12/2020, 05:15:30 pm)Yes*** Enter parallel dimension  - everything from here is from my imagination. It didn't happen this way***[Agent]  (Mon, 10/12/2020, 05:17:38 pm)OK, and by any chance is that also the email account from which the message that has not been forwarded was sent ?Me (Mon, 10/12/2020, 05:18:11 pm)Yes[Agent]  (Mon, 10/12/2020, 05:19:47 pm)OK, according to the documentation I have from out hosting team, that will not work by design. An email cannot be automatically forwarded back to the address it came from. This is a safeguard against 'infinite loop' emails. Is there an alternate address from which you can send an email to test the forward?Me  (Mon, 10/12/2020, 05:19:54 pm)Sure, I have a different one I can try.[Agent]  (Mon, 10/12/2020, 05:20:41 pm)OK, please can you try that?Me (Mon, 10/12/2020, 05:20:42 pm)I just did and yeah, it worked fine. Thank you, [Agent]![Agent]  (Mon, 10/12/2020, 05:21:07 pm)No problem. Is there anything else I can help you with to day?Me (Mon, 10/12/2020, 05:23:08 pm)No, that was everything. Thank you very much [Agent]![Agent]  (Mon, 10/12/2020, 05:24:29 pm)You're so welcome! Have a great day!"
