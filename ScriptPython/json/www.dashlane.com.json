All my logins (I have over 100 of them) are randomly placed, not in alphabetical order  any more. I have to hunt one by one looking for the password I want. Made four calls to technical help, all say we are aware of your problem and it is in the queue. We cannot tell you when it will be fixed. I even wrote them yesterday, never heard back. This does not inspire much confidence in the technical capacity of people in a company who are supposedly guarding your access security !"

I was then told that the engineering team were 'deprioritising' my issue.I've asked for my account to be deleted and to start again, I've offered to switch plans, I've followed every instruction given to me, but to no avail.It's now nearly 5 months later and nothing has been done. Customer support have been friendly on email, but haven't solved the issue - when asking for my membership to be paused until this is sorted out, or my renewal date to be extended, or eventually asking for a refund now that my patience is exhausted, I've been refused and told 'after 30 days, there are no refunds.'Please use another service like 1Password or NordPass instead and save yourself the hassle - I'll be over here in Dashlane purgatory with my unused 21 seats."

' saying 'should' meaning they themselves are not sure if the data is transferred. If these statements alone don't convince you to choose otherwiseI guess try it yourself and save hundreads of passwords and after a year find a new alternative like 'Bitwarden', thus cancelling your subscription with them and 'literally' losing all your passwords with no way of getting them back since the support doesn't know either on how to get them back.Let's not forget the web client has a flaw where if you use any other browser apart the ones they support, YOU will have to log in every single time and won't be able to use the feature 'save login info for 14 days' this service is a joke.Forget this app and just get 'bitwarden' or 'keepass' like they're free, offer same or more value for free and have better customer support. Probably even bought their reviews on trustpilot. Serious accusation, its probably true."

But when it doesn't-My oh My!!!!!!!When I upgraded to a new iPhone I was no longer able to access my Dashlane account or any of my passwords or information! What followed was almost 5 weeks of time-consuming, frustrating, and excruciating email correspondence where I felt myself going around in circles. While not the world's leading tech-savvy person I do regard myself as having basic competency and despite following the instructions given was not able to rectify the problem on m y own and needed assistance. I was expected to respond within 3 hours to verification codes sent to my email. The problem was I am in a different time zone to the Dashlane technicians and they were not able to schedule for the code to be sent to me at what might have been a reasonable time in my time zone!I could not get to talk to a technician by phone to help guide me through the process of trying to resolve the problem (despite making this request several times and providing contact details!!!). While I appreciate the need for strict security and would not want anything other than strict security for my passwords -I was expected to remember the exact date the account was opened which was over 5 years ago, the number of log-ins I had, and the exact date that my last log-in was! I might have been able to answer these security questions if I had been able to access my account!  They would not take into account any other information I tried to provide or the fact that I knew the Master Password!After demanding help from higher management, a second technical assistant finally helped me sort the information out from their side which I appreciated.I am not in the habit of writing bad reviews but this experience was so excruciating that I felt I needed to share my experience."

It's a poor app at best, I hope to find something better.  I hate paying for crap that doesn't work right and yet they charge you for it not a one time charge but yearly!!!!"

And so it goes, for days, and weeks or longer. Your money is gone !!!!!!!!!!!!!"

It would generate passwords and not save them, and when using with Firefox on Linux it would never auto fill. I requested a refund after 3 months in to a 12 month contract and they refused to give the refund even tho we are not going to be using their terrible software. Please do not get Dashlane there are much better and cheaper password managers out there."

If you don't mind all the ridiculous limitations, the poor UI, if you're not worried about the autofill submitting sensitive data in the wrong places and all that, if Dashlane is the alternative to using the same password all over the internet, sure, Dashlane is better than that.Other than that, I really fail to see any way in which it would be better than literally any other password manager, including free / open source ones."

For me, I found Dashlane\u2019s integration with iOS to be good, but I found its desktop applications (including browser extension) to be buggy from time to time. My husband\u2019s experience on the other hand was a nightmare. He basically was never able to use Dashlane after creating an account and was charged before his free trial was up. I switched to Bitwarden which has been really stable and the UX has been fine once I got used to it."

Dashlane relies on the \"We're receiving lots of requests for help...back to you as soon as possible\" excuse for not providing its user's timely help.  I expect that it is true that the company is receiving a high volume of help requests - most likely because the company is creating this volume with its poor customer communications, which typically raise more questions than they answer.  Easy problem to solve, imo, but I doubt that Dashlane management will do so.  Effective communications?  What's that?"

Dashlane are fully aware of all the issues, but their response is always the same \"we will look into this\" - but they never actually do. The product has got significantly worse since I first started using it, which is a great shame. I hope one day a change of product manager will mean a change of priorities for the developers."

Autofill is intrusive and tries to fill fields where it doesn't belong. It tries to autologin everywhere immediately as a default, so you miss messages on the login screen or get errors when there is a recaptcha. The iOS app is glitchy and I end up having to do everything manually. But the WORST is that it does not always save new passwords it generates! It has glitched between the time it autogenerates a new password and when it saves. It also has overwritten a one password with a different one on the same domain. None of this happened before. It's a total mess and I am getting out of this service even though I have a lot of prepaid months left."

You either have to reload the page and hope it picks it up or you just end up opening the application every time, looking for your password to manually copy the password and into the website. A very temperamental offering. And there is next to no support from the support team. Each time I log an issue I am told that my issues only affect a minority so therefore its not a priority. Great.

However, in the end, and after nearly two months of endless emails and convoluted instructions, I finally was able to resolve the problems myself. I have repeatedly said that what Dashlane lacks and is sorely in need of is telephone support, or the ability to remotely access customer computers to resolve complex problems that the average user cannot resolve. I have a string of emails that has to be in the 30-40 email range since mid-April. It had gotten so long and confusing, I could not even locate a recent email from Mary because it was buried in a barrage of lengthy emails between me, Mary, Roxanne, and I don't know who else. Again, Mary did her best, so this is no reflection on her, but I am extremely dissatisfied with the way in which Dashlane is set up to resolve technical problems. It is just unacceptable, and it is one of the main reasons that I may not renew when my subscription expires next spring. Your employees are not being provided the tools they need to resolve problems. It is simply not their fault that customer service is deficient.Dr. Ralph Perrino"

I could update everything offline when I am flying all over the world, and do it all offline with the Windows App. When I land I can sync and then I am done. But this always-on and connected world we live in is crazy and very hackable. My other complaint with Dashane is they are now heavily dependent on third-party browser developers and their security policies, preferences, and updates. In recent times both Firefox and Chrome made major changes to their APIs that invalidated lots of plugins. Allowing my browser to be part password facilitator and password controlling operator for my passwords makes me feel less safe, there is always a browser backdoor despite the robust security claims Dashlane makes. But with the Dashlane Windows app, which is dead now, you can choose not to integrate Dashlane with your browser for the most ultimate security. Using Dashlane in standalone mode, with an occasional sync is the best way to go.  I am going to 1PASSWORD now at 1password.com just because they have an offline Windows app and web plugin. Getting rid of the Dashlane Windows app is just plain dumb and has killed a once-great program."

At the end of the day what should be a seamless password population process. It would turn into a long troubleshooting session to try and get the mobile app to work.  Ultimately, I had to default to manually log in to the web application to extract the passwords.  Not too much of a convenience anymore... I tried to engage with customer service, who sadly demonstrated that they did not read the case notes.  When I referenced my case number they would engage into a painful process of having me explain to them (in a text chat since there is no phone customer service) everything that was already explained in detail on the notes of the ticket.  Solutions were band aids that always failed and my mobile app never worked consistently. To this day, an L3 still has a ticket open and unresolved."

After importing 600+ passwords from CSV-file, the option \"require master password for this site\" is turned off by default and there is no way to turn it on by default for all passwords at once, zo you'll  have to do this for each stored password individually. The Chrome extension doesn't lock after a timeout, so once you're logged on, any site you visit will be automagically logged on to. So if you leave your browser unattended for a short or even a long time, all your accounts are exposed. Even in the premium version, I can't find any way to change 2-factor authentication to anything other than a code sent to your e-mail at every new logon to Dashlane. Google authenticator, Authy, nor verification via text message are not supported. Passwordt can't be grouped into categories, it's just one long list of passwords.Secure notes can be opened without typing your master password, so they're not secure at all.There is no option to add an emergency contact to access your account. PRO's:Importing passwords from CSV went pretty much flawless. Dashlane's VPN on mobile seems to work fine, so Dashlane is cheaper than Lastpass+NordVPN combined, but more expensive than just LastPass. VPN won't work on Chrome OS though."

The next day a different agent emailed me with an entirely opposite answer. Referred me to a web site which explained how to do it. Unfortunately I had already seen that site and that was what made me aware that the feature Reset Master Password on the Ios app was missing. Two response two answers no solution. The problem was not that serious to me but it did give me a taste of their service. I am well within the 30 day cancellation window and emailed them to cancel my account and refund my money. I notice that there agents frequent this board. I have not gotten a response yet and would like to ask the agent how do I find out when these actions will take place.

The main \u2013 and worsening \u2013 problem with the system is its instability and unreliability in auto-filling login page fields. This feature was one of the main reasons I purchased Dashlane. I estimate that on average to begin with, and until about 6-9 months ago, auto-filling fields was performed successfully in about 70% of instances. That rate has now fallen to less than 40% and now I pretty much expect auto-filling will NOT be performed at any attempt to access my sites.The DL support group are quick to help, offering trouble-shooting advice, but that cannot win against software which is defective. I get fed up with having to do support-troubleshooting every few weeks and am getting increasingly annoyed at the inability of Dashlane to perform properly \u2013 or, actually, perform at all \u2013 in auto-filling access details at login pages.A second niggle is that despite promises a long time ago that two-factor logins would be offered through the Dashlane system, it still is not possible as far as I can tell to get Dashlane to log in to my banks and other high security sites which have two-factor access systems.I am now investigating alternative Password/login systems, despite having a long period remaining on my Dashlane premium subscription.Message to Dashlane:  I'm not interested in bells and whistles when the basic, crucial parts of the software don't work properly.

          "Contenu": "I have been using Dashlane for 6 months now and I am not impressed.  Firstly, the only option given to subscribe for a year and not monthly is indefensible and is purely to tie customers in.Secondly, after 6 months of trying everything I can think of, and with largely useless help from Dashlane support, the Android app on my mobile simply does not work.  Not once in 6 months has it either populated any login field or taken me to the relevant password when I tap the Dashlane logo that appears next to a login field.  Not once. Ever.  I have to login in Dashlane using the Master Password every single time, even within a few minutes, look up the password, and copy and paste it.Thirdly, although Dashlane works on my laptop using Windows 10, it only works some of the time.  Often it does not recognise a website, ebay for instance seems to fool it for some reason, email browser is another.  I then have to copy and paste the login details, then Dashlane asks if I want to save the details, it does and I get a duplicate entry.  Same thing next time I log in.Also there are really annoying missing features.  No facility to 'click and copy' anything other than the password is one.  Bank sites often ask for a customer number, etc, with no Dashlane field to enter this other than in 'notes' which has no option to copy.  Another, the 'secondary login' field has never worked for me.And I have paid \u00a370 a year for this.  Clearly Dashlane know that if they offered a month subscription users would cancel.I have now installed LastPass on my mobile which works every time without issue.  As soon as my annual subscription is up I am jumping ship."

          "Contenu": "First, let me state that I've managed technical helpdesks for over twenty years, so I know what I'm talking about. Also know that the issue still exists - there was no change in status which resulted from this chat session.Communication skills: Low. More accurate to say very low. Descriptions were imprecise - often (exclusively?) limited to \"it\". I was left wondering what \"it\" was with almost every sentence. And those sentences seldom made grammatical sense, although they were full of technical jargon. Having worked for Microsoft and Intel, among several other Fortune 100s, and having taught adult-level technical classes as a trained educator, I can tell you that even this tech's jargon was misapplied. This led me to wonder if this tech knew what he was talking about at a technical level. Desire to fix the problem: Low. I wasn't guided through a single activity step, even though I asked for such. Any sort of interrogation with regards to the nature of what I was experiencing was not once performed. It felt like this tech just wanted to meander through this session with no desire to attain any real results, and it felt like I was being talked at, rather than being co-engaged in any useful exploratory process. Incomprehensible jargon-strewn word salad finally led me to draw the session to a premature close.Baiting the ref: In the tens of thousands of technical calls I've personally handled throughout my career, I never once asked for a good review, nor did I ever have to. That sort of thing never leaves me with a good feeling - fortunately, I seldom see it occur.Lastly, this was my second attempt to find an answer to this situation. The first attempt, some months ago, also ended in a patently unsatisfying dead end."

          "Contenu": "I actually like the product and the concept.  I find the help function, compatibility with IOS and ease of understanding how to get things done exasperating.  For example, I received a notice from Intralinks that I needed to change my password.  I set it months ago with Dashlane (after much exasperation!) and now cannot figure out how to get the \u201cpassword changer\u201d to work and change my password.  Is it even possible to do so with IOS?   Of course there are no customer service people to call for help so I will now wander around until I find a fix or simply not use Dashlane for this website.  I like the concept of a VPN but have yet to figure out \u201chow\u201d to turn it on and determine if it is working.  Does it stay on all the time?  If not, how should I use it? How do I know if it is on? My wife has also signed up for Dashlane.  I am pretty sure we do not need to both sign up but cannot figure out how to discontinue her account and make certain we are not losing anything.  I am a Premium member.  Between the two of us we probably have only been able to use Dashlane to protect 10-15 passwords.  Again, no one to call.  I have used the chat function and the people are helpful but it is difficult to explain problems and get useful answers.  To be honest, I have spent many hours trying to make Dashlane work for me and will probably invest more time but I wish I had never started this project.4/3/20. Dashlane followed up my initial review, told me the site where I wanted to change passwords was not supported and that I would have to go on the site, change the password myself, go to Dashlane, type in the new password and then save it.  As I initially said, this entire exercise was exasperating!  Although the tech personnel who correspond with me via their \u201conline only, written, help desk\u201d always seem cordial, Dashlane over promises and under delivers."

          "Contenu": "Feature-wise, it is a proper password manager with rich feature set and what seems to be a sound threat model with modern cryptography. Works very well on mobile.However - the desktop (Windows) version is just BAD. It is *horribly slow* and hangs often (in my case, I have to kill it from taskman circa every 5 days - sometimes multiple times during a single session). On my non-SGX-enabled PC this is somewhat better, but still painful. Even on a pretty powerful PC with 32gigs of RAM, this is still very noticeable. Not to mention the penalty the web extension incurs on the web browser...This is NOT what I would expect from a paid, professional product, especially since the desktop app performance is something easy to optimize one would think... After spending over 2 years with Dashlane and hoping that a new version will improve, I am slowly giving up \u2013 It starts to look as if only a full app rewrite could help here (again \u2013 mobile version is pretty decent) :(---Extra features I am missing:- Ability to adapt rules/tag 'missing' fields as sth to be filled (e.g. credit card input routinely fails to recognize expiry date or CVV)- A handy \"dismiss autofill\" option next to autofill, so that if one wants the form gone - they do not need to cxl it each time they navigate between fields- Localization (or at least full country list). It is ridiculous, that each time I enter a bank account, I need to go back and edit the country to 'Poland' (global preferences do not acknowledge its existence)- Ability to use multiple domains/URLs for a single password entry (or to link them together). Currently, for the autofill to work, I need to have 2 entries for: amazon.com and amazon.de, for example... though they're using a *single* Amazon account. Password health dashboard recognizes this as password reuse... which makes it impractical (I have about 30 accounts like this, so I need to manually check what is legitimate reuse and what is not)"

          "Titre": "It was good... until Dashlane stopped innovating",
          "Contenu": "Today on 11th Mar 2021, I switched from Dashlane to 1Password after my 3-year contract with Dashlane expired. I managed to get a $99 USD / 3Y deal in Sep 2017 and also managed to get several months added on for free by Dashlane when I recommended it to a friend and he signed up too.I started to look for a Password Manager back in 2017 because managing so many passwords in an Excel spreadsheet, which sat inside a TrueCrypt container, which sat in my Dropbox, just became too much! So the switch over was a massive relief. However, since 2020 onwards, Dashlane became more and more frustrating to use because it seemed as if the company stopped innovating. The tool didn\u2019t keep up with how websites have evolved, which in turns affects it\u2019s performance in day to day use. I will give a few examples.1. Password Browser Extension[Speed] - The extension became too slow and didn\u2019t work around 30% of the time (my estimation as I don\u2019t have the data). This was one of the most maddening things because if the Dashlane suggestions don\u2019t appear quickly enough, you have to manually go to the app and copy and paste them both. This is the same as using a spreadsheet or free local password manager! [Multiple IDs] - Another problem was that I have multiple IDs for some websites for business and personal use. These would also cause problems in appearing quickly which was very frustrating.2. Synchronization Speed between App, Extension and iOS AppWhen updating or changing a username or password in the Dashlane Desktop App, the web extension would not instantly sync about 70% of the time. It was weird because you know the sync has worked when the indicator spins around, but the only way it seems to appear in the password suggestion box in the browser was if you either log out and log back into the extension, or if you wait for a few hours the extension somehow starts to work. I could never figure out why this happened because I have never lost any data after hitting the sync button in this scenario. However, autosync never guaranteed that the data would instantly be updated in the extension either. Once again, this drove me crazy as each month of my contract went by. (My contract started to feel like Shawshank Redemption, just waiting for the day I could escape). 3. No Tags or FoldersAs I signed up for more software and services over the years, Dashlane\u2019s \u2018Categories\u2019 for managing passwords became next to useless. You could never see a nice list of the categories on the left hand side of the App. Towards the end, I never bothered to use the categories function because it was useless. On top of that, as my parents are getting older, some kind of folder or tag functionality became critical because their email and other accounts got bundled in with mine too. 1Password has taken a much better approach by providing not only Tags, but also different Vaults as well, so you can keep Work, Parents, Personal data separate, as a few examples. 4. VPN was uselessOne of the features which was touted by Dashlane back in 2017 when I signed up was the integrated VPN. However, on the few occasions I tried to use it when I was overseas, it was too slow and you also cannot decide the location of the VPN. The location of the VPN is one of the most important features so that you can use services that are geo-blocked. [The Positive part of my experience]Wherever there is bad, there is also good, so here are the list of things that I liked about Dashlane in the 3 years I have been a customer:- Dashlane NEVER lost any data. That is absolutely fundamental with any piece of software that is looking after the crown jewels of your data. They have also not had any security incidents that I am aware of. Even though their sync is slow and terrible, I always knew that if I entered data into one of the apps and manually hit sync, it would show up eventually on all my devices, even if it took an hour or two. - Being able to select the colours of my payment cards stored in the app was fantastic as I am a very visual person. Dashlane also automatically selects the colour of your passport which is also fantastic as I am a dual citizen and need to get the right passport details quickly when I am booking travel. - The overall UI design for the desktop and iOS apps were nice. (The extension is terrible though).[Summary]In 2021, I would not recommend choosing Dashlane because it has seen zero innovation over the past few years. There are better solutions like 1Password on the market. Dashlane was good when it launched, but I would not recommend it today."

I logged in yesterday and the password for our ERP server was gone on Chrome and my iOS device.  Luckily I tried Edge and it was there, so probably a caching issue.  I'm glad id did not have to wait on support because the server I was trying to get into was down!Anyhow, this experience is making me second guess a few things about Dashlane.  1. Email support is slow in a pinch.  2.Have you considered snapshots so we could go back in case something like this happens.Thanks!"

What kind of a scheme is this?  Is Dashlane TRYING to displease their customers who upgrade?  Why do you insult your customers with a third-party VPN that can be used only an hour or two each day?"

My last support request took a day and a half before they even got back to me - let alone resolved the problem. On top of that, Dashlane pretty much just doesn't work on mobile. It's no good on any app, and most of the time it fails to autofill in my Chrome browser, too. Oh, and one last thing, when I go to use a credit card, it won't let you even once without reentering your master password... It's shorter and easier to just type the card number in, so Dashlane is no solution for that."

I have many clients (for whom I've turned onto Dashlane) that are continually confused by how Dashlane operates.  As a  simple example.... To get help with my tech-related issue, I had to create a NEW HELP ticket by answering what Rev/Ver software I was using... annd most lay-users would have NO clue.  I'm not saying I have the answers.  Just noticing the areas of opportunity for improvement. Ps. I'm a tech consultant.  I've been using Dashlane for 5+ years.

          "Contenu": "I eventually was able to get my question resolved but it was very difficult and unfriendly experience. I tried the FAQs - no match. I tried the Dashlane Customer Support and the system merely replied to my question with another question. I was deeply disappointed that it was an automated system and no human interface. I finally defaulted to the email approach and waited several days from a reply which didn't come. I resubmitted my question and finally received an answer which solved my problem. Almost a week to get any response that worked. BOTTOM LINE: (1) no phone to call available when in \"uncharted waters that FAQs don't address -  BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE, (2) disappointed that a human did not monitor and reply to my question when I accessed the Customer Service Support portal - BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE. (3) lastly, too long a period to reply to my email question - BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE. In summary, Dashlane's help and customer service was the worse I've experienced in this digital world. Love the Dashland system but the bloom is off the rose after this experience."

          "Contenu": "The Security is obviously top notch, there's absolutely no doubt about it. But the differentiating factor is Dashlane app's UI. Both the Android and the Web apps are great in terms of their UI/UX. They should just work on the Autofill in the Windows now. From Android 11 onwards, the Autofill on Android is integrated in the Keyboard itself, which is great. But there's no such provision in the Windows version. The Autofill pop up keeps interrupting everytime. Plus disabling that pop up is also a hassle. It would be great if Dashlane could bring a more minimalistic pop up for Autofill in Windows that doesn't interrupt in between while typing. Also, they have recently discontinued the Essentials plan. The minimum plan that you can purchase now is the Premium plan, which I feel is a bit on the expensive side. It would be great if your could bring a more cheaper version of the starting plan. Nevertheless, anyone planning to switch to a Password Manager can choose Dashlane without any hesitation. You will be more than satisfied with their service."
