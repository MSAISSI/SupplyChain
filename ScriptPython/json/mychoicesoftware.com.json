          "Titre": "**CAUTION** Use caution when purchasing software from MyChoiceSoftware & pay attention to license!!!",
          "Contenu": "If I could give it a zero star I would. I purchased Microsoft Home and Business for my home computer from Mychoicesoftware.com. This worked on my computer, HOWEVER it is not at all clear on their product page that this is NOT a product that you can transfer, or reload. After having this installed on my computer, I uninstalled and went to reinstall on a new computer. After over 2 hrs on the phone with Microsoft, I was told that this was NOT a product for consumer sale (see screenshot), and used a developer license. After reaching out to Mychoicesoftware customer support, was told that this was clear on the product page and that because I loaded it one time they were good. So for a savings of $20 from the full Microsoft license, I don't have any ability to reload a product that was not intended for resale to begin with. Spend the extra little bit and buy direct from Microsoft so you can reload as needed and have for the true life of the product, not only a one time use. Disappointing customer service and even more disappointing they sold a product that shouldn't have been sold and did NOTHING about it."

I contacted the company and was told to call them and they would help me figure it out.  I have tried to call twice and have been put on hold and then disconnected both times.  I contested the charge with AMEX and was told the company wanted to deal with me directly to process a refund.  So, I am stuck in the middle of lots of red tape when all I want is my $100 back for software I cannot use.I received messages from your office on my phone.  When I tried to return the call (from Gabe on 9/22) the first time, I was sent to a voicemail, where I left a message. I received a call from someone else (Alex on 9/25), and then again today.  I am tired of playing phone tag over an issue that I have explained REPEATEDLY.  If you are not interest in returning my money as I asked, so be it.  Let your actions stand as a reflection of your customer service and your commitment to quality service.  I am done!"

Had trouble with the download (never received the software) and told mychoicesoftware I was canceling purchase per their warranty. They refused. Said that by creating an admin account I voided their responsibility. Total POS. You might ask where does the warranty say that it will be voided by creating a 365 account with Microsoft, or simply that the warranty that will automatically terminate before you have a product? Never got an answer. Big surprise. They are a sub-par 3rd party seller. I seem to recall litigation between them and Microsoft for similar behavior. Do not trust them."

I should have listened to my instincts.  I went ahead and downloaded the image from the link they sent me.  When trying to install it on a brand new Dell Precision Windows 10 Professional PC, I got an error message telling me the installation was for a 32bit operating system.  That angered me immediately - Luckily Dell had the 64bit installation already preloaded (which I did not know) so it asked if I wanted to install the 64bit, which of course I said yes.  After installing it asked for the license key.  I pasted the license key they sent me in email - and low and behold - the key had already been used the maximum number of times.  How unsurprising.  I will never buy from this scam site again.  I called Microsoft and thankfully they helped me get a legitimate key to activate the software."

I have noticed that the codes that I have been purchasing are not following the procedures that Microsoft states must be used to \"activate\" those codes.  I have tried to activate several product codes that can not be activated and EVERY code I have received from MyChoice I have had to use the Telephone activation to activate the product.  According to Microsoft agents this is NOT normal and is a sure sign of Fraud.   Today (January 2022) I had a PC that I had purchased Office 2019 for in September 2019. It had run an MS update that corrupted the Office install.  I eventually had to completely uninstall office na dtry to reinstall office.  It would not activate. I tried several methods to activate it and each time it failed.  I contacted MS support adn they told me the product had been activated at least 30 times by 20 different Hardware IDs and it was first activated PRIOR to the date I purchased the product key from MyChoice.  MyChoice maintains that they do not sell used products  but cannot explain explain how my product keys were activated PRIOR to me purchasing them from MyChoice.  They refuse to replace the product key and say that Microsoft's system are in error.   Given all the problems I've had with Activated dozens of Product ID's from Mychoice, it now makes sense what they've been doing.  I spent over 3 hours on the chat with Microsoft discussing all of this and over 1.5 hours on the chat with MyChoice.  I have both transcripts and have filed a fraud case with Microsoft against MyChoice and am contacting my attorney's to begin legal proceedings against MyChoice.  Do yourself a favor and DO NOT purchase from them."

Microsoft's solutions are a maze of recursion and self-contradiction, and nothing from Mychoicesoftware helped to clear up the confusion. I needed to get Windows up and running swiftly, and I'm coming up on 24 hours into what should have been a simple installation and activation. I know Microsoft is a nightmare, but I'm wishing now that I'd just bought the (admittedly more expensive) option from the Microsoft Store.Followup: Mychoicesoftware gave me instructions as to how to get in touch with Microsoft. Microsoft Support walked me through the verification process and informed me that the software activations had been \"exhausted\" and that they couldn't help me. I've gone back to Mychoicesoftware to see what their solution is but given the time and energy I've invested to get this to work, I am definitely paying for having cheaped out. Will edit again when I have some sort of resolution, but the vibe is bad."

The reality is that you cannot even begin a download without providing the key code. So much for knowledgeable customer support. Nothing worked but to compromise my sterile system."

Initially, I received an email offering me a free update to Windows 10, but when I used the link that was emailed to me, the Windows 10 update was installed, but my Windows 8.1 was not replaced, so my computer seemed to have both systems battling it out. (That was the consensus of our two IT guys, our internet provider, and the two senior technicians at the Microsoft store with whom I consulted.)\r Due to the many problems I experienced as a result of this issue, I decided to just purchase a new Microsoft license and start over. Yesterday I purchased Microsoft License for Home Order #20076620.  When I received my activation code, the email said that the Windows 10 Home version that I had purchased was out of stock so I had received a complimentary upgrade to the Pro version.  I then initiated the Windows 10 download with the link provided, which went fine until I entered the license code that was sent in that same email.  Then I got this error message: \"This key doesn't work with this edition of Windows. Try a different key.\"  \r Overall, this entire process has been very frustrating, as I've consistently followed the instructions in the emails that Microsoft sends."

Cool. I didn't know whether I would take advantage of the offer or not, so I did not reply yet. Then after about a month I received an email saying that in a few days I would start being charged $10/month for these subscriptions unless I said otherwise.So... they signed me up for a \"complementary\" subscription that I did not ask for and were going to charge me if I didn't \"opt out!\" I used my credit card on their site to buy one thing - I did NOT give them permission to save my credit card information to be used to purchase other subscriptions that I didn't specifically say I wanted. I did reply and \"opted out,\" but in order to charge me, I should need to opt in, not just not opt out. And after they sent me like 5 emails saying over and over that it was complementary, it could have been very easy to miss the email that said they would start charging me in a few days. Very unprofessional and unethical in my opinion. I won't be purchasing from them again, because I don't trust how they will use my credit card information."

Click on the preferred download link.2. Once the page loads, select \"Download.\"3. Insert key code when prompted and you're all done!\"Well, that was a fabrication! I was given a download link with DropBox and when I got to the page, DropBox told me I needed to sign up for the service.  I contacted MyChoice and they told me to bypass the DropBox signup, so I did, and then I was able to download. However, during Setup after typing in the Product Activation Key, the Software reported that \"too many downloads had been made using that Key\" and refused to let me continue the Setup! So, I had to contact MyChoice again with a problem.  When I got their response a day later, I was told I had to accomplish the telephone call-in to Microsoft to get my software to activate. I had to leave on a business trip so it was 3 days before I could attend to it. The Microsoft activation stuff itself is nuts: you have to carefully copy about a dozen sets of letters/numbers before you finally achieve the activation for your software. In other words, Step 3 above \"insert the Key Code and you're all done!\" is a bunch of baloney, as this took me not only hours of my time directly working on trying to activate the software, but it ran into days because of delays communicating with MyChoice. How is that a good experience? And furthermore, if I should have to re-install my software after reloading Windows 10 at a later date, am I going to have to go through this nonsense all over again?  Sure, Microsoft Publisher now works on my comuter, but believe me, you're better off paying a little more to get the software on a DVD and avoid this activation license procedure! It's too much hassle, especially if your time is valuable to you and you have better things to do than sit at your computer all day. MyChoice Software needs to be up-front about the procedure and tell buyers that it may be much more complicated than they are claiming."

At the end of of it all, all is fine, I am pleased with my purchase, and I would purchase from My Choice again and I will recommend the site to friends.

I had to have Microsoft text me a code and enter a code in from the screen to activate. Both copies did activate with no issues after I did this. I have bought copied of this Office Suit from other vendors in the past and have not had to go through these extra steps. Just takes a little more time to do that is all.

If that's the case, why would anyone buy the AE version?Mychoicesoftware has responded to me that the note about AE license will expiry is incorrect and AE can only be installed in 1 PC and (I think) the AE cost should be cheaper than standard version.  However, if you see the mychoicesoftware website for MS Office 2010 AE, it still show $149 and indicated the AE license will expire in the description.  This page should be updated to reflect the correct price and description of the AE version."

When I started the \"Download to your computer\", I was advised to download MEGA, or \"Continue slow browser download\".  When I selected the latter because I have had my fill of useless third party add-on software, I was redirected back to the \"Download to your computer page\".  I then sent a quick chat describing above but never received a reply.\rThen it gets humorous,  I dialled a help number, 1 800 318 1800 and was asked to answer three questions about taking a cruise.  The old bait and switch, and very unprofessional.  I then called 1 800 318 1439, and a young man advised that I could not download with MS Internet Explorer, and would need Firefox or Chrome.  I said that this was odd as you are selling MS software.  I used Chrome and it downloaded successfully.\rTo send this comment, I am now asked to \"Post and verify with Facebook, which I never use or e-mail.  The e-mail option asks me to create Trustpilot account.  Why would I want to create a Trustpilot account?"

I saw the negative reviews in places, and the complaints on BBB, but I took the leap to purchase from MyChoiceSoftware because I could see on the BBB page that they were responding to and resolving the concerns of customers who filed the complaints. Even before I purchased, they were very responsive to my emails-- plus it was clear that those responses were coming from real people who had actually read what I wrote!

No problem though.  Then after it was mounted, I got an error that it was a 32 bit, not 64 bit.  But there was an option to install the 64 bit version.  Ok.   Finally, when I input the product key, I got an error message that it had already been used.  The good news was that the Microsoft activation wizard automatically gave me information to contact them by phone if the message was in error.  After some time and giving them a 56 number code & entering back in a 48 number code, everything works fine!!"

This time we decided to go with a download link of Office 2019. I was a little nervous, but decided to go ahead with this option. First, I called 3 times and the phone was answered very quickly all three times!   My third call was answered by Kat and she was truly a life saver! At this point, I had realized that I should have uninstalled MS Office 365 prior to installing my new Office 2019 software from My Choice Software.  The Office 365 had literally been taking command of the situation and I needed help.  Kat was very patient and kind. She  was able to assist me remotely and removed the pesky Office 365 software for me and made sure that all of the Office 2019 programs were properly loaded. It was such a relief and we are very happy customers!"

Before he hung up, he walked me through the phone installation process that I would encounter with Microsoft.  He made everything go smoothly.  I have recommended My Choice Software to others and will continue to do so."
