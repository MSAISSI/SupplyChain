          "Contenu": "I gave up on my data in 2015 after they canceled a wonderful program and moved to the cloud. I am a doctor and they are not HIPAA compliant. I spent the last 2 years with them getting zero help from their customer service before giving up. For awhile I could get into my data and then that stopped. I lost access to all of those years of data, about 10. I just recently received an email saying they were going to dump my old data. I had to pay $250 to download it, which turned out to be a lie. I did their 30 day trial making it clear I was going to get my data and get my money back in the trial. Cancelling the free 30 days as Val told me would be no problem came with a lot of jargon that would preclude I would NOT get my money back or my data. Another lie. I called billing and left my number for a call back. She just called back and hung up. I assume because I couldn't hear her and told her that; unless it was Val who hung up on me. She claimed to be the sales representative and customer service. She didn't have a clue how to download the data. As others have found they haven't changed and it is now 8 years since my data was deemed useless."

And then...they made changes in their software and everything is cloud based. Awful. Have spent hours with their \"experts\" only to have them ultimately agree that the software is lacking. Have set phone appointments and never got calls. Chat never open. The rates doubled but the product diminished. I literally threw hard earned money out the window. A few customer service agents have been nice to deal with but have no power to improve the software. Lots of excuses...meanwhile they collected $264. Ultimately I was told the only way to get the expense report (simple request!) is to pull it together manually. Really. How inefficient. And what did I pay for then? If I cancel I lose access to all my past years data. Cannot export it...really crummy. I tried the last 2 years to be \"useful\" and \"helpful.\" Now I am just mad."

They say that they will send you the software for free but then they require you to subscribe to the cloud in order to access it. this was not the agreement I made when I purchased all of their scanners for my business. Very poor customer support for your long term users. you built your business providing software and scanners then switch to monthly subscriptions to milk the customers that get you there.....shame on you!If the rest of us conducted business that way, we would be out of business or facing a lawsuit for bait and switch."

Then when you call to cancel the subscription  you are questioned why you want to cancel your subscription and after convincing the person their product does not fit my needs and does not seem to integrate with QuickBooks desktop 2020, they cancel your subscription and even though I was one day into the subscription they will still charge me for one month.  I'm sure its in the fine print but please, you should be a little more transparent."

You can certainly continue to use your Neat scanner and we provide step by step instructions on how to do that without using the Neat software so you are not required to have a subscription in order to use the scanner. Please see this for details:......... (link not allowed).........We are also on the verge of releasing a free scan utility that will also allow you to use your Neat scanner without any additional cost. We hope you'll be able to take advantage of that when it is released in the very near future.\"So where is this free scan utility???? Because I haven't found anything."

It's bad enough that I lost all of my files that I shredded after copying them onto my computer that died, but now I have spent a lot of money on a machine that is totally worthless to me now. I will certainly NOT be purchasing another Neat machine given the \"service\" I have received when I really needed their help. They had NO concern for my needs as well as no mercy whatsoever!

I have been using the Legacy Software since Introducing the cloud software that they came out with right after I got my neat scanner.  AND I HATE THE CLOUD SOFTWARE.  As much as both of my scanners cost that should be a standard feature.  I hate how the cloud software logs out all the time and for a company that has unlimited cloud storage already the subscription service is too expensive for rude tech support. The original software, in my opinion, the legacy software version was the best. I dont know why they would do this too it."

So I did research and purchased Epson WorkForce ES-500W Wireless Document Scanner for $ 329.99 which is rated 4 stars instead of purchasing another NEAT for $483.90 which is rated 2 star. I really needed a program like Neat and that is the only reason I stay with the program."

It also seems much more labor-intensive that the previous version.I'm hoping I'll improve as I get better using the system, and I'm hoping the program is improved quickly."

Three, when they say they have finally fixed a problem, they send you an email and say if it is reoccurring to send them an email and then you will be able to bypass everyone and go to them, problem is they never respond and you have to start all over.  I have a problem where I scan in a document, then enter all the information and a few minutes later all the information is gone and you have to re enter it."

In short I think your product falls short in many areas especially since you went from desktop to SaaS.  Your Saas version does not have the same scanning and reporting abilities that I was accustom to in the desktop version I had been using for more than 10 years. While I'm interested in your SaaS I fear the same minds that created the original desktop versions are still creating the SaaS version as I can see the signs such as week reporting, no scanning directly from the SaaS.  You asked for an honest review and I have provided it, now it's up to Neat to do something about it."

NOT GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Going offshore to the Philippines may have saved Neat money, but for the customer it is not efficient.  For example I called the Philipines gave them my question a polite person said please hold, 10 minutes later somone else picked up and I had to explain the problem again. this person said please hold, another 10 minutes, guess what a new rep. got on had to repeat again.  Bottom line they could not answer & just were trying to sell me the Premuim edition of Neat."

I knew the Legacy software I had used for years wasn't supported now, and I needed to know which of the subscription programs best suited my small company needs.  I chose to 'chat' with a Customer Service rep and let them guide me and decide which level of service I needed.  I initially provided a little background about my company and poised the question to the Customer Service rep:  Which level of Neat would be best for me.The rep ignored my question and began telling me the difference between the monthly rate and the annual rate of the premium level and no matter what I said, all the rep could do was quote me the prices and tell me how much I would save by getting the Premium level and pay the annual rate.  I hung up in disgust and bought the 'Lite' level of service and the rep called me and started again with babble about the annual versus monthly rate for the Premium program.  I told him I wasn't interested and hanged up.  The next day he called me again and said he was ready to 'finish the transaction'.  I told him to never call me again.  I did have an issue getting the 'scan' button to work for me and I reluctantly called Neat Technical Support.  The dear lady who (almost immediately) answered my call was very helpful and got me going in just a few minutes.  That's not the interaction I'm being asked to rate here but I added one star because she was knowledgeable and helpful.  HOWEVER, there was a party going on in the background:  People laughing and chatting about this and that, background noise unrelated to technical support, and the lady helping me was distracted several times by, I assume, someone speaking to her while she was trying to help me.  So to use just one word to describe Neat Customer Support, that word is UNPROFESSIONAL."

I have had repeated issues over the two years. I had some of the same issues as other users.  Here are the highlights\r1. Difficult to understand how to operate initially although eventually I figured out the basics but none of the more advanced features.\r2. Scanner that came with purchase package did not work. Replaced under warranty. Wasted one week waiting on exchange.\r2. Poor job of scanning photo business cards or promo cards. Even though the TV ads show that it is designed to scan business cards.\r3. Slow to PROCESS scanned documents, receipts, etc.\r4. Frequently selects wrong amount for sales tax on receipts.\r5. Must review every document input to verify correctness.\r6. Frequently have to re-scan because of lack of clarity on some of pages scanned especially for mult-page documents..\r7.Once scans are in folder, if you have ANY problems (which I have TWICE) and have to reinstall, all of the folders are gone. The scans can be recovered but what good is that when two years of scans are all jumbled up? I can do better with a shoebox!\r8. Customer \"service\" is a joke. They try to hide from helping you behind online FAQs only. UNLESS you pay for a service contract. (Which I object to since it has been a plethora of continual problems from the start) I spent over $400 bucks on this machine and expect it to work. I expect better for a product that has only ONE function! \r9. I have been trying to get email \"help\" since January 26. Today is April 1 (this review is not a joke) and I STILL do not have my issue fixed. I have been unable to use my scanner since January 26. It takes 3-5 days to get an email response. This is the worst customer experience! Don't they know that consumer's number one reason to shop elsewhere is lack of service AND inability to get a phone number to TALK to someone? I guess since they have the only product of it's kind they can be smug about their crappy service but as soon as that patent is up and other players enter the field, I am DONE with them!\r UPDATE 4/1/2015 I FINALLY was escalated to a senior technician named Genine. She was a GENIUS and unraveled ALL of my issues with one screen share. Can't the company see that the favorable impression that occurred in that ONE session could have been done from the start and avoided three months of seething frustration???"

Neat company is no longer producing or updating the software necessary to operate the scanner. They are instead going for the big money and forcing it's customers to subscribe to their online cloud services!! Tragic mistake! I have thrown my scanner in the trash since it is now completely useless. I spent good money for my ND-1000 and I can no longer use it. What a horrible company!!! To assume that every user wants to join a pay per month cloud service to scan receipts and automatically send them into QuickBooks or some other program is just plain defective thinking! I am a realtor and I need a doc scanner to convert paper into PDF files... as do many others I have spoken with about this crazy move!!!  Good luck, but I am outta here! Done with Neat and their money scam cloud BS!!! Why on earth would anyone want to pay another $10 a month for the rest of their lives on top of the already pricey original purchase of the scanner!!??? Someone needs to be fired at neat!!!"

I have used neat for several decades and love the simplicity of scanning my receipts to set up for reports during tax season. I have some issues with your recent upgrades. Your orange colored platform was fabulous. It was a one click type deal and you could scan your receipts, edit and send to your folders. Now with this blue utility thing we have to click on the icon, scan doc, open browser, sign into neat, edit doc, then send to folder! In your attempt to make upgrade feature you\u2019ve inadvertently created MANY more step for us to use the software. A quick solution to this, and one I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t thought of yet, is to simply add a neat cloud link to the blue scan utility. That will reduce those extra unnecessary steps you\u2019ve created for us.Lastly, your neat books service nice as it is and possibly a decent competition to quick books is WAY TOO EXPENSIVE at almost $500/year! You need to come down significantly on this service if expect us customers to purchase that service and expand your customer base. A nice sweet spot for this program is an annual price of $250-289/year. Otherwise your not going to be me and others to subscribe to that service and many of us just might go ahead and change to quickbooks service. You got a great program! Don\u2019t screw it up by being too greedy by overcharging for the service. At least this is my opinion!!!"

I was not able to get it to work & did not have time to address due to competing priorities, instead relying on the iPhone scanning apps. Subsequently, I saw an \"annual\" renewal which I was upset about. When I finally called, the rep stated that the company now was supporting the updated Mac software & had a cheaper package. He walked me through the installation process & I was thrilled to have my scanner functional again! I was also thrilled to see him plan to refund me > $150! If so, I will now again be a supporter of this product (ND-1000)!=== 2023: unfortunately, they discontinued their software support for the great scanner so I discontinued with their service\u2026"

I called the phone number on my credit card statement and was able to get to tech support and get the issue resolved, which is a work around of sorts, but I am finally able to use my neat scanner again.  I then called and talked to billing regarding why I didn't get a notification of the charge and asked if there was a month-to-month option.  The rep requested the refund of the yearly subscription and will process a monthly subscription.  The billing rep was courteous and helpful.  The Tech support rep was a bit difficult to understand and it took over an hour for a process that I believe should have only taken maybe 30 minutes or less."

A Neat assistant tried to move my Legacy data over to the Cloud, (a small amount of data from 2012 was moved successfully, however a data file of over 1gb could not be moved) I have considered this data a loss and have moved forward.My recent phone call concerned the ability of splitting a receipt i.e. a medical prescription vs household items or groceries. I was informed this work was in progress and would possibly be incorporated at a later date.As an old school user, I still am not convinced the Cloud is safer than storing my data on an external drive and back-up to a flash drive, but I am trying to change my mind.Thank you."

The new app does not take you directly to the NEAT app. I was told I was using the old \"orange\" version of NEAT and should use the \"blue version\". The blue scan app is the new version- it doesn't take you to the NEAT desktop. You need to use the old orange version if you want to work on your desktop (which I prefer) or otherwise work in the cloud version going through the website with no quick link. Many of us prefer to work on our desktops and mirror on the web based version. Everything works better but getting custom reports is still difficult. This is a major improvement over the last two years but still lacks the functionality of the original (non web) version from 4 years ago."

Even though I have enjoyed using NEAT over the past 8 years, I personally believe it was a big mistake to change the program from 5.7 to legacy.  Sarah helped me to learn and use the newer program to the point that i fully understood it.  It is not user friendly and not easy to go from scan to home to reporting to saving and printing without going back and forth to the app.  I firmly believe that you had a program that fully satisfied my business needs perfectly and I would like to see you reinstate supporting it.  I will continue to use 5.7.  I hope this is valuable to you and you take it seriously.  Thank you.Larry Boemmels...A LONG TIME USER"

I've had some frustrations with features that existed in the legacy software that have 'disappeared' in the new version. And when I reach out to support via email, to ask clarification questions I get a canned email response of \"...That feature is not available -- we'll pass it onto the development team\" -- even when that answer does not fit my question at all. I do hope these disappearing features (some of which are obvious programming ball drops) are fixed soon.Per your note below -- how do I reply/forward case # info to you?

I had to be convinced to pay the small additional fee for the higher level of support after I had just paid for my initial Neat Desk subscription, but I will say it was well worth it. It is great to now have all my accurate data and history on my office pc, and on the go on their excellent mobile app. I was skeptical at first about having to move from the legacy software to the new cloud-based service, but the features and capability are well worth it, and I highly recommend paying the small fee for the extra support for a year. Liza C. and her team are top notch!"
