          "Titre": "EXTREMELY deceitful practices.",
          "Contenu": "I have bought a couple of items over the years through BackMarket.com.  It appears their main reseller is iPower Resale.  I will honestly say that the previous items I've bought (apple powerbook, apple watch, and samsung watch) I've never had an issue with.  The problem started when I had an issue with a macbook (it would arbitrarily not charge..it wasn't a block or cable issue because I tried two other known good cables/blocks).  I returned it to iPower for diagnostic.. prior to returning to them, they sent me their policy warning me to back up my data in case of loss.  Knowing that I did not have the ability to back up my data (as the computer stopped recharging and would not turn on) I taped a letter to the laptop asking that they not delete any data, and if a data reset was needed, to send it back to me instead so I could retrieve the data through professional means). They got back to me and said there was no power issue with the computer and it was working fine, so I told them to send it back to me.   Then a day later they suggested they provide a replacement.  I said I would only agree to that if they could transfer my data.  They replied it was against their policy to do that.  So, I again, asked them to send my computer back.  2 days later they said they could transfer the data.  I had no faith they could, so again, I asked them to send me my computer back.  4 days later I received a different computer.  This computer was set up with someone else's admin name and password (although none of their data was present on the computer).  I, again, asked them to send my computer back. Over the next 2 weeks they refused to talk to me, and finally admitted to deleting all my data and selling my computer.  In my opinion, what this company did was criminal.  It is akin to my bringing my car to the dealer for a warranty fix, them selling it, and providing me with a new car that doesn't have any keys.  Stay FAR away from iPower."

Frequent attempts to have it exchanged or serviced were impossible, as they only reply to emails once a week, or less. Brought to the Apple genius bar who wanted $1200 to fix it, as it had the wrong CPU installed, declined that. Ultimately had to have my credit card involved, and it's now a very expensive paperweight."

Researched alot about passing post and bad switches - checked ram is good, know it takes a while to check, I have 30+ years experience in computers, for the life of me can't figure this out, and feel I shouldn't have to deal with a finicky mac and feel that is what I get for buying refurbished! Originally bought the mac pro 1,1 and loved it. Upgraded it til I couldn't anymore. I thought the final version would be the best, but have not noticed much speed difference between the 1st generation and last generation. The mac I bought even had that fancy fastest ever hard drive - which I removed to troubleshoot the problem starting up, sleeping, and startup - did NOT make a difference, still need to hold in power button to start/come out of sleep."

Through amazon,i have emailed them four times telling them my computer died with only using it for college studies for 7 months. i asked Amazon to get involved about this and the seller avoided replying back to me within 48 hours required by Amazon. This seller is of no help to customer problems and sell lemons. On that i kindly asked for an exchange of product as i have a short window to get my computer working as i start college within nine days and all Apple and repair services are slowed  down terribly with Covid. With Apple closed means i have to put about $900 out of pocket as two authorized repair facilities had  said the issue is with the Logic Board. you would think that when a seller sells you in good faith a product that is close to $2000.00 they would stand behind their product. They wait days before each response even though i stated i have limited time window to get this device fixed as my college engineering Cours of study begins and this computer has all. My summer coding and homework on it. . STAY AWAY. NO Support, and arrogant like, telling me they need to follow policies set by their refund division as opposed to help a college student with no income on unemployment. Since I did not buy extended warranty that it is my problem. Frankly, they SOLD ME A LEMON. THIS IS THERE PROBLEM. THEY WANT TO TAKE YOUR MONEY AND NOT HELP. We all know they buy parts wholesale and could solve my problem for a fraction of retail that iI will have to pay. BAD BAD SERVICE!!! On sixth email to them, they responded: I will diagnosed for free, but will not fix it for free. You have a chance of buying a lemon from them.There are plenty of other resellers out there. Pick one that cares. Especially since they get parts for wholesale. No computer that costs $1,700 should fail in 7 months. The unit was not dropped, no liquid was spilled on it. It had  just college use and left in a good home environment and not even committed around."

I believe this is deceptive advertising, and request compensation.After reading iPower Resale's response, I talked to LeeAnne on 12/12/22, around 4:50 pm ET. I said I assumed that an item described as \u201cnew / open-box\u201d would be like a new item in all respects except for the open box. I said my \u201cnew\u201d computer only had a 2 month warranty. I asked if iPower Resale could cover warranty costs for an additional 10 months. She said No. She said iPower Resale provides a 12 mo warranty for direct sales. I asked if they could provide that to me. She said No. I said the purchase was thru the Walmart website. She suggested buying a warranty from Walmart. I said I didn\u2019t feel I should have to buy a warranty for a new computer. I said iPower Resale then should say in their descriptions that \u201cnew\u201d computers have less than a 1 year warranty."

If you going to do business with them, buy the extended warranty.  To me three stars is generous, two is more like it."

A week after arrival I gave up and called an expert to come and help me.  We manage to resolve the issue by buying a keyboard at Staples to complete the installation.  The wireless keyboard did not allow us to do the installation neither the CS person was telling us that when called.I am fine now, using the computer, I highly recommend that you are more supportive of your product and also include some basis information for the installation.  I am not stupid, my husband is good with computers but we incurred in extra expenses that could have been resolved with some instructions included up to telling us that we needed to have a regular keyboard  to install and get up and running.ThanksElvira"

After brief discussions about how to fix the problem, they agreed to send me a new one if I first purchased the replacement from them.  Then I needed to get NewEgg involved because they needed to send me the RMA and shipping label and Newegg needed to refund my original payment.  NewEgg, at first, was uncertain as to what their role was.  In the end, I did get the refund.  But, to me, I had to be the business interface between the two companies to resolve who's role was who's responsibility.

          "Contenu": "While the purchase of the refurbished iMac machines was a breeze, what the seller's ebay listing lacked was any kind of warning, advising that the buyer would need to acquire charging cables for the Bluetooth wireless keyboard and Magic Mouse 2 (both sets of peripherals arrived as uncharged, unuseable devices). Perhaps the seller made an assumption that the buyer (me) was someone familiar with Apple products and would know beforehand that these peripherals would arrive charge-less and required advanced charging before use. One of the iMacs I purchased has been out of commission since it was received on April 1st because of this oversight on the seller's part; I had to employ one set of wired k&m just to get by. It would have spoken volumes about this seller, and would have added significant value to this transaction, had they gone the extra mile by including such charging cables in the boxes. Hence, only 4 stars were awarded from this buyer."

It works like new and I got it for the fraction of the price I would\u2019ve paid for through Apple. Plus I power resales Product care program is extremely worth the extra hundred dollars or so. I would recommend getting that with any merchandise you buy it\u2019s by far better than apples \u201capple care\u201d quick run down about the comparison. I got a brand new iMac through Apple back in 2020 and I noticed something was wrong internally with the machine and they refused to do anything about it until a year and a half later after almost 20 visits to the store n my machine was almost out of warranty..this place makes it clear if they\u2019re is anything wrong they will work on it right away. So I will be coming back here whenever I need any apple products."

I was still under my 90 day warranty. I tried my best to remedy the issue but there was nothing I could do. I messaged them and they gave me options. So I ended up just buying one for them to send them I\u2019d be able to send the broken one back. I\u2019m in Maryland and the box from California got here in a few days. I was able to recover my new machine and have sent the broken one off. The process was very quick and no fuss they took care of me. Highly recommend A+"
