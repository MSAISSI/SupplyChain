          "Contenu": "Yeah, really, just save your money and go with a better brand. Customer service tries,  but lacks the human empathy trait and the sense to see that the product was applied 24 hours before registering, but my card was swiped the day after the repairs were done, thus, I guess voids the \"warranty\". Even though it clearly states,  \"may void warranty\" simply means they have the means to be compassionate and understanding, However, they lack that. I guess with most companies anything to keep a buck right? Told you I'd keep up my original review but, my human empathetic and human understanding have in to change it. So you see, that's how it works in life. This company has not and is not willing to take care of their warranty. You do you, but warning, read the fine print, they'll do anything to get out of it."

Long story short this product is garbage, and you should really just pay for phone insurance which is by far superior to this SCAM!"

AFTER they take your money, you learn that you have to register your phone with the company and even then you don't see the fine print that you have to register by putting their app on your phone!  Absurd, I'm not putting your app on my phone.  Then on top of that, you subsequently learn that the lifetime warranty is only for 1 year.  Absolute waste of time and money.Edit:  My response to your response is that your business practice is deceptive because you don't disclose in advance what's required to take advantage of the warranty.  It should be clearly stated in the advertising, not hidden in the fine print you get AFTER you pay your money and they paint your screen with the chemical."

They will find every excuse under the sun to reject your claim.Updated: This is how bad the customer service is at Cell Helmet.  They replied to my post here to let me know my dispute of the rejected claim was rejected instead of letting me know through the original service ticket.  Didn't know until 5 days later that they even replied to this.   Complete joke of a company, and I did submit a request before getting a repair, it just took 3 days to hear back from them.  What a joke!!!"

          "Contenu": "I bought a cellhelmet \"Fortitude\" iPhone cover at Batteries Plus for $39.99 on 12/15/22. My dissatisfaction is both with the product quality and the handling of the replacement. It was installed by the salesperson. About one week later I discovered the case was cracked (no misuse or \"impacts\"). I went back to Batteries Plus and was told cellhelmet fully guarantees their product and to go to their website for a replacement. I did so and was informed by email the replacement would be sent upon receipt of my payment of $10.98. Of that amount $9.99 is a \"processing fee\" and $.99 is \"shipping guarantee\".So my $39.99 \"fully guaranteed\" case will now cost $50.97. When I emailed cellhelmet about the fees, the reply was \"that has always been stated on our website\".To me, having to pay what amounts to a 27% surcharge to get a \"fully guaranteed\" defective product replaced this just seems like a poor way to do business. I certainly won't be buying any more of their stuff or recommending their products to others."

So okay I played their stupid game and bought another kit with $300 coverage they gave me a discount on (NOT WORTH IT). When I received the kit and tried to register it said my device was ineligible after several attempts I conceded. A couple weeks later my screen was cracked and I needed to purchase a new device. I received the new device excited I can actually apply the hardener and get the coverage I PAID FOR (twice over now). NOPE DENIED! My PIN was no longer valid. Who runs this company, Charles Ponzi!?

Within a month my phone screen got a dent. But when i went to the store, they said they know nothing about any warranty! I contacted through email to cellhelmet customer care. They said just sorry for that and said that they are not able to police employees which are not theirs. My question is then why you are selling your items without any authentic dealer, and with such huge price!!!!!!Reply to the customer service: What i purchased, costs me $54(including tax). If it doesn't under your warranty, you should accuse the seller and the store which is selling your products by telling lies to the customers. I have already mailed your customer service with the picture of the receipt, which clearly shows the name of the store and sales person. If customer satisfaction and trust really matters to you, you should take action. Its your reputation which is harmed by the lie of those stores."

The company cellhelmet aka Kane and McHenry Enterprises, LLC put in very fine print on the box nowhere else, not even in their ads or recordings that the warranty is only for one (1) year and I had a year a few days ago. Conveniently for this deceptive company they would not inform you when you purchase it or when you register it or call in, the recording goes over everything except that fact. They send you a registration confirmation with all the information except that very important detail so they would not have to honor the warranty or cover the claim. If you don't register it right away, they deny your claim. Too many shady, deceptive practices by this company. If their policy has always been a yewr then why not make it clear. What's the point if it is good a year and it's disguise in fine print that consumers are not aware? If they had any decency they would have put it on the receipt so consumers would be aware but as they have proven, they are not to be trusted and their sole goal is to not cover claims or honor warranty.

To put her company in social media, and more threats.   A letter was sent and they basically denied the claim WITHOUT a legit reason.  Because they can. BBB is next.

          "Contenu": "The company has a great pitch to lure you in, and for the most part, the product is well designed. The reason for the low score is more to do with the warranty and registration issues. The warranty is handled by an app and third party in the case of the phone case I bought. The app generated a random IMEI number, and if you do not catch the mistake within 48 hours, you are out of luck. Needless to say, it keeps them from having to pay out in the instance you filed a claim and did not catch it.Update: As predicted I am now three weeks into disputes on the validity of my claim and guess what the issue is; the IMEI. They have stated the 48-hour policy and claimed the app gets the information from the phone so there is no reason for it to be wrong, however, they admit it could make a mistake and that's why they have 48 hours for correction. I will update again once a resolution is made."

Of course the only time I notice the problem is when I am severely low on battery (luckily my other chargers, not from cell helmet, work well enough to keep my phone decently charged) I attempted to return/replace it under the manufacturer's warranty. The cost to do so was roughly half the replacement cost. I've finally disposed of the piece of trash and will buy a replacement from another company. With return/replacement policies like that, on a product that works under 50% of the time, I can't see why anyone would choose to buy again. I know I won't."

They only keep referring to an email that they allegedly sent requesting the receipt that I sent 3 times to them. Please share through this avenue if this is happening to more people or if this is just my case.**UPDATE 12/29/20: After continuous follow up they did pay the claim.

So now I'm trying to get it processed by calling them, getting transferred, asked to email again....still getting the run around.  Bottom line, don't bother with Cell Helmet, as they seem to be an evasive insurance company, making it hard to make a claim.  Next time, I'll go with a Zagg liquid glass warranty product, since they are the leader in the industry."

The product was cost effective and shipping was decently quick given the current world climate. So far so good.Unfortunately that's where the good news stopped. After receiving the product I followed the directions meticulously as I did not want to make things any worse by using the product incorrectly. I even verified my phone was not on the list of unsupported devices.The three or four scratches on my phone were very minor so I had high hopes that the product would eliminate them all together. To my surprise, after using the buffing compound and wiping all of the excess product off the screen, the scratches and scuffs were still there with what looked to be no change at all.I couldn't in good conscience recommend this product to anyone else."

Customer service is not too bad. Depends on if you can get a rep to even answer you on the chat.The warranty process is such a pain in the rear. Come on Cellhelmet fix this! I have bought a many of accessories from you for my family and myself. I'm talking mother,  sister,  cousin, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, husband and daughter. This was my go to birthday Christmas presents. I mean liquid glass pro+, the cellhelmet gel case with the $300 warranty, and chargers. Not any more. Now as long as I have to pull teeth to even get my screen fixed. I refuse to buy anything else from you. You advertise hassel free warranty process.  That false advertising. It's a HUGE HASSLE.  Fix it before you lose a lot of customers over careless employees you choose to employ.Thank you,Once was a huge supporter.  Now I'm switching to the basic tempered glass and insurance.  Less BS."

          "Contenu": "First off let me start by saying I like their product.  I bought my first cellhelmet accessory when I was on a business trip and I stopped by an authorized reseller to buy a charging cable for my phone because I was having problems with the cables I had.  I ended up buying one of their fast chargers with a cable for 3 reasons: 1) I needed a replacement for the fast charger that came with my phone that stopped working, 2) the charging cable worked well with my phone, and 3) the sales rep sold me on the lifetime warranty that came with the product.  After I got home from my trip, I decided to buy an additional charger with a charging cable and 2 additional longer length charging cables.  Everything arrived as expected and everything was good until one of my items stopped working.  At first I thought it was just my phone, but it didn't work with any device and remembering there was a lifetime warranty on the product, I decided to look into it.  So using my cell phone, I went to their site to figure out how the warranty worked and all I could see was a $9.99 processing and handling fee.  I was a little surprised and figured I must be missing something on my small screen so I decided to call them.  The representative I spoke with confirmed the $9.99 fee and when I asked why it was so much she didn't really have a good answer for me.  I personally think this is way too much especially when you consider most of the \"As seen on TV\" products charge $3.99 for processing.  I could say more but I'll leave it as that."

I was told I couldn't be reimbursed because I filed the claim with the wrong company, which is absolutely crazy because I used the Cell Helmet app to obtain the number to process the claim! Than somehow they filed a claim on my new liquid glass rather than my old. Than someone called me saying we need proof of the original liquid glass purchase. I sent that and called the number in the app again, only to get some company called Fortegra , and was told because it was now after the one-year mark it wouldn't be accepted. I was completely confused on who Fortegra even was and advised of my claim number to be told, \"oh that's Cell Helmet's claim number, not ours\" (WELL DUH I don't who Fortegra is as I have a Cell Helmet product and app!!). So I asked for a supervisor and was told one wasn't available. Kenya at Fortegra was rude AND unhelpful, and left me at that. So I reached back out to Cell Helmet and explained the matter. I filed the claim within the one year and sent all supporting documents. I was told they would honor the claim as I had the original email with Cell Helmet claim number on it, along with proof of the date that was within the parameters. The very next day I get an email saying we need document of your insurance claim. Mind you at this point I had emailed the original claim & all supporting documents (proof of purchase of the liquid glass, the insurance claim & deductible proof AND the packaging slip for when I received the replacement device) to 4 different emails including both Cell Helmet AND Fortegra. This process has been nothing but confusion, long and misleading in more ways than one!"

I attempted to call using the number provided in the emails and was unable to get assistance. I attempted to use the chat feature on the website and was unable to get any assistance. I finally reached out using instagram direct message and finally got a reply, but was still unclear about what I was supposed to do. I am hopeful that this situation can get resolved, because I was really excited about this product."

While I cannot recommend the 10 foot cable, I\u2019m happy with the 6 footer so far, as well as the customer service at this company. My most recent charging cord didn\u2019t even last two months. I\u2019ve gone through 4 chargers in less than 15 months, and I think I\u2019m finished with this company. A crappy charger bought at a drug store would last longer, and it isn\u2019t a real lifetime warranty since I\u2019ve paid $40 now for my replacements. I\u2019m so disappointed that Verizon recommended this."

I have gone through the process and gotten my repair voucher. While ultimately I received the warranty as sold I think the expectation of someone keeping up with a registration code to get the service paid for is a little extreme. Their system should be able to track cell phone number and the person's name because those things seldom change! So would I recommend them? No, I would not. But I bumped them to 3 stars for the follow up in finding my registration I just found it coincidental they found it after I posted a negative review."

I also feel like it took a while to get emailed back with a solution. I will say that I was pleased with the customer service when I did get ahold of someone and they were nice to give me a discount on tempered glass screen protector to prevent more scratches from occurring.

My experience is very similar to the other user rating who purchased the liquid glass at uBreakIFix one day ago.  Update:  I emailed Cellhelmet on Thursday, December 26th as suggested in the comment from Cellhelmet, but as of December 31, 2019, I have yet to receive any response.  Something is not right and I am cancelling two additional   liquid glass pro plus that I had set aside for me at UBreakiFix.January 2, 2019:  I am updating the rating based on my contact from Cellhelmet today.

          "Contenu": "My Verizon store sent in my warranty claim for me to replace the glass shield for an iPhone 8+.  They downloaded the proper receipt for that item but accidentally marked the wrong product in the drop down menu.  \"Honest mistake\" on their part.  So, the wrong item was shipped to me, an iPad4 screen instead of iPhone 8+.  Cellhelmet never even checked that their was an mistake in the Warranty Claim paperwork.  Contacted Cellhelmet and explained everything to them.  The operator who was very pleasant said that the store did send the correct receipt but marked the wrong product in the drop down menu. I offered to return the wrong product in an exchange, which to me makes PERFECT SENSE ..  The operator said they would not make the exchange and I would have to purchase another screen and apologized for the inconvenience.  Now I'm stuck with a screen I have no use for and have to pay \"again\" for another iPhone 8+ screen replacement.  NO CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR SUCH AN EASY EXCHANGE TO HAPPEN.  VERY DISSATISFIED WITH THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE....**** \"Judy\" from Customer Support contacted me and apologized for the lack of options that were initially given to me. She gave me a few options and I ended up getting a full refund from my order. My replacement glass for my phone is on the way.  Judy seemed very sincere and offered me any assistance in the future.  I am grateful that this \"bad\" experience did turn out for the best.  Thank you.........******"

Bought the $40 liquid glass screen protector on Feb. 23, 2019 from^he Cricket store, and had the girl working there put it on my phone. I thought well this will be good if I  drop it, at least it shouldn't break. Fast forward to about the middle of March. I suddenly had a huge scratch come up. Note I don't keep this in my pocket or purse. I only carry it in my hand, with a popsocket on. I went to Cricket and asked, they said that it doesn't stop scratches, just keeps from breaking. A bit disappointing but ok. Fast forward to today, April 11, 2019. I get out of the car, it fell 2.5 feet if even that far and shattered the screen, not just cracks but hard busted spots that will cut you, busted! I called he Celkhelmet and the girl said I wasn't registered... I had the email  and app to prove I was indeed registered. But they said hat regardless I would have to pay for repairs submit the receipt and then they would verify it and make a decision! Uhm, no! It should not  be have to make a decision as the claid was made less than 2 months after purchasing! I paid Nokia to repair my phone, then submitted my claim to cellh3lmet. Hopefully they will stand behind their product and send me my payment back. I am disappointed that my screen busted when their tests say they dropped a phone on concrete and it didn't bust until it hit 21 feet high and mine fell from less than 3 and shattered. Will buy a screen protector or case from now on!"

They explain to me that the case I ordered did not come with a warranty and therefore it did not come with a pin card. Because their cases with warranties are called \u201cPro\u201d it can be confusing when ordering for the iPhone Pro. After checking my order, I had incorrectly ordered the case without a warranty. They offered exchanges and replacements to meet my needs but, I ultimately decided just to keep what I purchased. Customer service team was friendly and accommodating to try to improve my experience.

The initial response from customer service was a little...pushy. But once the product actually got delivered they were patient and did not bother me.The product itself - I LOVED the cover. It's light, has good grip and takes a pock socket very nicely.I dropped it a couple of times and while the case has markings and some damage from that - my phone is absolutely A OK. Have been using it for almost 3 months now with ZERO COMPLAINTSOriginal Review:I haven\u2019t received my product. And even after raising a complaint with both USPS and cell helmet, the response was just to wait. In the mean time I have a new phone that\u2019s been accumulating scratches. I can\u2019t say anything about the product though - because I\u2019ve never seen or used it."

I'm currently 2 weeks in on a process I thought would take 10 days in total. Never the less the associate Lucy that assisted me today was exceptionally helpful!

Once I found the chat feature that was nice. Only reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars was that once my package said it shipped it took 3 or 4 days of the tracking information saying that only a label has been created and usps hasn't received the item yet. Had to contact customer service again and they contacted the wharehouse manager to get the hold up fixed.  All in all, it was a pretty good process especially for a warranty item. Only other thing I can think of is you need to have more of your screen covers in stock. Saw a lot of out of stock privacy screens. Maybe that's because of covid and stuff i don't know but just something to note. Thanks!"

I payed to fix the screen and applied for the warranty.. Cell brokers who apparently handle the insurance side denied my claim telling that the front camera picture was not done correctly.. I was furious.. Called them many times tried to resolve the issues, but to no avail.. After posting a negative review representative from cellhelmet reopened the case for me and got me reimbursed..

I REALLY appreciate it! I feel very confident in my choices now. I'll have better protection and coverage on my phones, and in the long run, save some money too! I received my cases and the quality is exactly as expected.Only issue: I avoid made in China at all costs!! Based on cellhelmet\u2019s FB video, 48% of their revenue comes from products Made in the USA. That made me happy to support them. Unfortunately, the cases I need are from China *bummer*."

This is not an issue with cell helmet, but I want you to be aware that sometimes there\u2019s a \u201chiccup\u201d when installing: It has 3 spots which look like air bubbles that the employee could not get out. 2 are at the very top of the screen & are hardly noticeable. The 3rd is on the bottom left corner. It is bigger, but is not interfering with what I see. You sent the product in a timely manner. It arrived undamaged. All is well on your end. Thank you."
