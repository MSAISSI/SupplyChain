If you\u2019re still skeptical just call them and I guarantee you it will go straight to voicemail and you can even just look up their address and see that its just a mail post office not a store or regular office.

Please let me know if you don\u2019t receive it.\u201d Well, I have emailed him at least five times starting on April 7th and Sebastian has went silent.  I have given him many opportunities to make it right BUT the ignored emails tell me that he has no intentions to pay what he owes me BUT yet he has my phone.  How can a company like this keep conducting their business this way?"

          "Contenu": "I received a confirmation that my phone was received over a week ago & was told that my payment should be sent within a business day. I got that message on a Friday so, understandably, I should see it that following Monday. I sent emails & left a voicemail on their provided number that only goes straight to voicemail to no avail. I see that they respond to customers on here but will not respond to customers that sent their items that they\u2019re still waiting on updates for. I saw another comment from the company stating that their prices doesn\u2019t reflect current market which is absolutely fine & understandable BUT COMMUNICATE THAT. If I was scammed, just say that & I\u2019ll just have to take that loss. I don\u2019t even know which order number to leave because I was given one when I agreed to the amount and another one when I got confirmation that they received my phone but it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019ll matter anyway. Lesson learned: do not release your phone from the \u201cFind My\u201d app until there\u2019s absolute confirmation that you\u2019ll be getting paid for your items.UPDATE: I just tried to email both accounts and both of them are showing as they do not exist. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY TO SELL YOUR PHONE. I am now S.O.L trying to get rid of electronics that I wasn\u2019t using."

I'm sure I will not get any reply. Guess if no payment or proof of return by Friday it's BBB time"

He provided details of what happened and the steps they have taken to prevent such reoccurrences in the future. I was caught off guard by the company's response/resolution and will be more than happy to use their service in the future. In hindsight, I wish I just reached out to the company as I'm not usually one to leave a poor review, but I mistakenly thought that they really just didn't care and left me with a \"go pound sand\" response. For those who have had a poor experience with Buyback Engineer, like I did initially, know that issues arise and if you followed the guidelines for a good faith transaction, don't be afraid to let them know as they really do mean well and care about a customer's experience. I am updating my review to 5-stars as they deserve it 100%. Thank you all for taking the time to read my review.Original:Buyback Engineer is a buyback company that wouldn't honor the quote they made for my phone. It's sad and disappointing as they are well aware that the issue is on their end and didn't make any efforts to honor what was quoted (they stated that their site showed the wrong price). They returned the phone, which should earn them a star. I didn't get back the original iPhone box that I included with the phone, which was also disappointing."
