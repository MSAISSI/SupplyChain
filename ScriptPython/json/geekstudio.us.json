This is a slick outfit and they will rip you off.  They will install LogMein Rescue Unattended software on your computer which means that they can get into your computer without your knowledge.  Do NOT, I repeat Do NOT allow them to touch your computer.  Hang UP!  I was connected to them by \"HP Support\" so I thought it was legitimate.  Real HP Support would help you start up a new printer for free.  These people want BIG BUCKS.  Again, HANG UP!"

He said did I want money back.   I said I'll call Canon and HP tomorrow so he got mad and messed up my laptop.  I shut laptop but not fast enough. There is no credit so I will have to dispute charge!!!"

          "Titre": "These people tried to steal from my\u2026",
          "Contenu": "These people tried to steal from my elderly parents a year and a half or so ago. They had the audacity to contact them again last week. I reported them to Hewlett Packard as they ARE NOT BUSINESS PARTNERS with that company (confirmed with HP's fraud division) and I reported them to the Better Business Bureau as well. HP said anyone can claim anything they want on their websites and there is nothing they can do themselves. These people are slick and were VERY aggressive when confronted. I'm in shock that they would even contact my parents again let alone try to get money from them - again. Here is a copy of the review I posted last year on Yelp for the scam details:1 year ago on YELPThese people are a scam. They conned my elderly parents twice, the first time in August and then again this week. They claim to be business partners with HP - which I confirmed they are NOT. They are not affiliated with Microsoft and they are not BBB approved. Their website looks legitimate. BEWARE. The scam? They got my parents to pay them for a contract to troubleshoot tech issues and to safeguard their home pc. The Geek Studio was given full access and loaded a program to my parents home conputer. Six months later, i believe they dropped a virus on my parents computer. The Geek Studio called the minute the alleged hack occurred saying they got an alert. William, the tech, claimed the service contract my parents had didn't cover ransomware and that they now needed to pay the Geek Studio $995 to stop the virus. The $995 price was for 5 year contract to safeguard my parents IP address and against all other breaches. They then offered my parents a lifetime plan for $1450.00 - and because my parents were \"good clients\" The Geek Studio gave them a \"deal\"or $1250.00 for a lifetime of \"protection \".THIS WAS ALL BS. When I researchered The Geek Studio I found others they took advantage of too. And as I said, I contacted HP immediately and confirmed my theory. I then contacted the Geek Studio directly and had to deal with a nefarious, hostile man named Gary. Let me say this man is nightmare. When I refused to relent and threatened legal action - which I will still pursue- they caved and refunded my parents the $1250.00. We were forrtunate to get the money back. But the damage and time lost and all of what we now have to do with fraud alerts, changing accounts, passwords and all that comes with this kind of crime is time consuming and stressful. Please, do not trust these people. DO NOT PAY THEM FOR ANY SERVICE. DO NOT GIVE THEM ACCESS TO YOUR COMPUTER. These people are well organized and their website looks professional. They are savvy perpetrators and they prey on people with limited tech knowledge."
