Actual date of experience may not be accurate as it was a while ago and I just received this request to complete a review like a year later and clearly have not returned as a customer, which I think says everything you need to know! He\u2019s also \u201cheral-jess\u201d or something on eBay and you\u2019ll get the same attitude there. Avoid."

I once sent them a list of my wants and got a reply 2 weeks after saying to check the website cause they didn't have time to manually see if they have them or the prices.  Most of the ones I wanted said \"contact for price/stock\" or similar.  Another time I placed an order that took 3 weeks to ship and it was incomplete and one slip was the wrong version.  Will never buy or even consider buying from them again.  I guess the guy who runs this doesn't have the time or care too much."

          "Titre": "AVOID ORDERING HERE AT ALL COSTS!",
          "Contenu": "This is a totally shady business run by a single greedy seller named Cliff Loker. He puts limits on the \"HOT\" items but doesn't indicate anywhere on his site that there is a limit of one item per customer, and that is absolutely unfair and confusing and frustrating to customers. I ordered 3 copies of a steelbook from him because I ended up missing out on ordering them from Best Buy, where I always order from. I chose Priority Small Box as the shipping option because that was the lowest price option available. Had he bothered to inform me that there was a limit, I could have saved money by just ordering the one copy and choosing regular mail or media mail to ship. And he already collects payment as soon as the order is placed, so I was charged for all 3 steelbooks and I was obviously upset when I received only 1. I had to call him in order to find out what happened. Luckily, he refunded me for the steelbooks he never sent but he still never bothered to notify me about the situation after the order was placed. This guy Cliff is a total scammer and bait-and-switcher and he definitely made some money off me. This was my first experience ordering from him but I will definitely not be doing so again and I encourage everyone else who is a serious collector like me to avoid buying from him at all costs!"

Furthermore, customs charged me 1.12 \u20ac tax (that's ok ...) and 6 \u20ac flat fee because of 'Goods not fulfilling the conditions laid down in Article 28 and 29 of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union' - meaning the seller should have paid the sales tax / VAT in advance. In the good old times (before July 2021) taxes below 5 \u20ac haven't been collected (if the value of the attached customs declaration was accepted ...\ud83d\ude03) and there was no delay in your order. Nowadays 'they' try to scrape up every single $ or \u20ac 'they' can get \ud83d\ude21 to balance the government deficit ...Nevertheless - the overall experience was positive and I would buy again."

The goods came from US to France in about ten days after ordering, and were adequately packed.However, be cautious when ordering from abroad because of elevated import fees. By default UPS may charge you as much as 38\u20ac import fees for a 20\u20ac bluray! These 38\u20ac decomposes into 5\u20ac of mandatory import taxes (depending on the country you live in) which you cannot avoid. Yet, the rest is only vaguely referred to as \"processing fees\" by UPS and is basically no more than racketing!In some country though - such as Canada, for instance - you can ask UPS to deal with the custom by yourself. In such a case, you only have to fill-in a paper for the local custom and pay the ~5\u20ac. However, in other countries - such as France - you cannot do that and are you are forced to submit to the transporter's racketing and pay whatever they want..."

All sold items are genuine, either in brand new or used condition.But above all, it\u2019s the contact with Cliff that makes the experience great. Any issue (of which there were barely any in my case) can be sorted out and he\u2019s always open to take a look into specific requests, such as slip covers and items not listed on the website. He answers very fast, too! In short, he\u2019s a perfect contact for collectors.I try to come back as much as I can and support a retailer like BFE over Amazon. I wish we had someone like Cliff / BFE in Germany, which is why I ordered so much.Buy with confidence!"

The owner came back to me quickly, processed the order, there weren't any hiccups (it was a long journey from the US to Ukraine.... ), still, it arrived even earlier than estimated (I even had to pay at my postal office because I didn't pick it up in time, because the delivery time was so fast) - the casing and everything was very well packed; you could see that the person working on it cared. Yes, if you compare prices - BFE might be more expensive, but I think it's worth it, and I wouldn't give a second thought before buying again."

The shipping method of 'spaces' can be slightly confusing but always found BFEO accommodating in resolving.Always found BFEO easy to contact and quick to reply. You also get shipping notifications etc.. Any human mistakes are quickly rectified.Some things are out of their control such as USPS delays. Freight traffic was slower during the pandemic as less cargo space due to PPE shipments and less passenger planes flying with freight/post in the hold.I have recommended BFEO to others outside of the USA who have also been looking for a rare US item with them being pleased too and will continue to do so.Highly recommended."
