I signed up for a 20 day free trial, only to have it end after a couple of hours with them demanding I give them my credit card details to continue with services. Perhaps it was serendipitous because I ended up going with a different vendor who was able to handle our business and also offered SMS and direct voicemail to email features. After this frustrating experience, I researched and learned they are not truly secure, which leaves their customers susceptible to having their details stolen. Guess someone was looking out for me, and I am extremely thankful my gut instinct was to NOT give them my cc details.Customer Service: 1/2 StarQuality: 1 StarTrust Worthiness: 0 Stars"

He then tried calling again using the same number, but I didn't answer. Then he called again, this time from a UK number. I then told him that I didn't want to speak to him anymore and repeatedly asked him to delete my data.It's really unbelievable what kind of company this is. I have now blocked my credit card as a precaution, because who knows what else they have written off.People stay away from this company and don't give them any data!!!!"

          "Titre": "major ongoing issues with virtual phone number.",
          "Contenu": "I was looking to set up a virtual phone number in Germany, and Tollfreeforwarding.com website stated that it could set up international phone numbers in 60 Seconds. That sounded promising, so I created an account, provided my credit card details and then..... a message stating that I needed to wait for something. The website gave me a phone number to call, if I didn't want to wait. So I called the support number, but ended up waiting indefinitely on hold... nearly two hours and still nothing, only an annoying voice that repeatedly promises that international calls can be set up immediately. Its very disappointing.. UPDATE: I've managed to get through to the call centre, only for the call to suspiciously drop out. During another call, my call was transferred to someone else who didn't know who I was or why I had been transferred. I've since been in contact with the team leader, but now I'm told it can take between 5 to 10 business days for the phone number to be connected. They are trying to expedite it following a complaint I made, however its in the hands of a third party telco provider in Germany. Hopefully TollFreeForwarding can liaise with the German telco to set up this number soon, I really need it for a job application in Germany. I wish they had been more transparent about the processing times for German numbers... then I would have applied for this number much earlier but I relied on their representation that this would only take a few minutes.Update: After a few days, the service was finally set up however IT DIDN'T WORK when I tested it-- when I tried calling the virtual phone number the target phone did not ring. I have reached out to tech support team.Update 2: Tech support team says they fixed it, however the service is still not working properly. Although the target phone now rings and I can answer the call, there is a high latency, which makes it impossible to communicate natural... call participants inevitably end up talking over each other. I have asked for service cancellation and a full refund because I can't use this product at all."

I have never seen my toll free number show up on my caller id as I had thought it would"

After a while and after placing this information in Social Networks and TrustPilot, they contacted me and offer a reimburse.They said it was going to be sent by Western Union. Until today (more than 3 months) money hasn't been delivered.I really regret to have trusted Tollfreeforwarding."

Ok, the same thing happens again. I contated another sales by email, and I want to ensure whether they can provide service to us or not and she said \"We service to customer GLOBALLY.\" And then we went to the payment process but failed. I called the customer service, a woman just felt impatient and said \"I cannot say any reason but just we do not provide you service.\"Excuse me?? I have contacted your sales for over 2 weeks and then you now say please find another provider?? I am not sure whether it is because we are from CHINA. I mean, the fact that you are even too lazy to give us a REASON is so RUDE. Everyone, please think twice before you choose Tollfreeforwarding.com, I am not sure who will be the next one to be DISCRIMINATED."

They PROPOSE to cancel your account and confirm a refund by email, but in the end, that doesn't happen. You get an email as you failed, and so they canceled your account and kicked you off as you were a fraudulent person. The customer \"assistant\" has not even tried to keep you as a client.

(they ask for pics of your credit card!)Once you add your payment method to their website (hoping you'll get the advertised \"free trial\" by doing so), they'll send you an email asking you to reply back to them with a copy of your ID, proof of residence, front-and-back photos of your credit card AND a signed document in which you authorise them to charge you for \"forwarding services\", without ANY mention of the amount, the date, the terms nor the advertised \"free trial\" (you've also got to fill the document with your credit card number, expiration date and CVV number).If you refuse to do that, their answer will be, \"Unfortunately we're unable to provide you with services. We recommend you look for another provider. Best\".An if you come here to complain about them, they'll just call you a liar, or say you did something wrong, or make up things so people think you're just mean or wrong and the company is right!Look at what they said about me:\"We are happy to provide free trials to customers that would like to test our services. Our security system is very good at spotting account information that is connected to an existing account that has violated our policies. If this occurs, additional information and further review of the account is required. This system is in place for the protection of our company and the protection of our customers.\"I've NEVER used their services, let alone broken their policies! That's what they'll do to you if you come here to warn people about them!If you don't believe me, then just go and try to get a free trial from them... Keep in mind that after you add your credit card to their website though, you'll NOT be able to cancel or delete it! I'll have to call them or send them an email, and then, and ONLY THEN, they'll inform you that they need pics of your credit card and everything else I said..You'll NOT get free trial with them, and if you do buy their service, they'll keep adding other hidden fees to your credit card, as said by many people here and on others websites like this.99% of the positive reviews here are made by people who came here only to review their company and then never came back! As if they just had to do it or would profit from it... The company does use this page to attract people to their website, where they advertise their \"\"\"\"30 days free trial\"\"\"\"\"!I do NOT recommend this company.PS: They've already flagged this review THREE TIMES! They do NOT want you to see this!! They've been trying to put this DOWN!"

However, once I tried to reach customer service, my view on this company quickly turned. Not only was I first nearly spammed with emails like \"Hi, I am x and Id like to help you, reach me under this number or email\", but whenever I actually TRIED to reach someone I never got an answer. I wrote like three mails to JeremiahS, which apparently is the account manager responisble for my account. How do I know? Well, I received three automatically generated emails from him, stating, that if I ever have questions I should just write him. So much for that. I also wrote to official customer support, but same issue. No answer since a week. Thats not okay. Account number is 7261097."

Customer support is below average as sometimes they don't respond.Many new numbers have some sort of spam issues. Clients would call us complaining customers are calling them to yell at them for calling and hanging up- which they didn't.  The number was spoofed which Tollfree said was \"normal\" in the industry and not able to be stopped.We're using another service with 2 dozen tracking numbers over 6 months.  Not one dirty number, no spoof problems, great smartphone app and a much better/more current website."

Doesn't happen all the time though, but noticed it a few times. Also, website is overly difficult and complicated to use to manage your account. Unable to make any changes to your monthly plan without having to call in, request it, wait for them to make the change, then email to follow up to confirm changes have been applied, very inconvenient."

          "Contenu": "Since writing the review below, I have been contacted by the company and they are trying to  rectify the problem. I give them credit for their quick response to the review and to their efforts in resolving the situation  now and at the time the problem was first reported. Time is likely going to be a factor in resolving the problem in its entirety but the interim solutions that have been suggested by the company seem to be working. I am still a believer! So, two stars to begin with, four stars now and hopefully five stars in time. Too many wrong numbers. Suggest to me that the toll free numbers are handed out too soon before the last user finished with them. We experienced several calls asking for the same service - i.e. the service provided by an earlier user of the toll free number that we were provided. After contacting the company, they did try to correct it and they offered a small discount for the inconvenience. It was of no consolation as the wrong numbers continued. Eventually we had to limit the area from which the calls were emanating. This significantly reduced the number of wrong calls. I suggest that if you are considering this service, you do not update your documentation or publications with the new toll free number until you are satisfied you have received a number that has been properly vetted. We didn't; it was a costly lesson."

The transition process was seamless and needless to say I'm ecstatic to be paying a nominal 19 bucks a month, and even better I can go into my back office and if I do get a spam call(s), I simply go in and block that number.
