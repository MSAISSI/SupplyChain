I go to ask to return them after receiving them and nothing?! THIS COMPANY IS A SCAM DON'T USE IT I'D RATE THEM NEGATIVE 100 STARS IF I COULD!!!"

I'm told that there's an app coming that will push through an update to fix that, but there's no ETA for it. So, I'm stuck with headphones I don't like and I cannot sell because they are defective."

I would give a negative rating if I could and will never recommend anyone use these. Anyone who has any idea about headphones already has a better pair and the company is straight garbage. It would take way too long to recount every bit of ridiculous behavior from start to finish and no one would care if I did."

You can buy their new shirts, though, or order headphones through their website, but the headphones customers initially bought and are waiting for have not arrived because, again, this company does not care about its customers.  And the product does not live up to expectations - they sound like mud."

After contacting customer support I'm knocking my review down to one star. They absolutely ignored my question and were rude. Too bad I can't return these.

I never got them. When I reached out to customer service again, I was sent a new tracking link that stated UPS was the delivery method, not the USPS: the link pointed me to UPS, but when I clicked on the tracking number it sent me back to my original USPS info, stating my headphones would be delivered by August 23 (that was in the middle of September). I inquired about this and was then told I had to check with customs. But the point of origin was San Leandro: 30 miles from my house. I\u2019m speaking with my credit card company to get my money back and inform them of the company\u2019s shady business practices.

March comes and I hear nothing, so I email them and was told shipping was delayed until april. In April they are expecting to ship 10k units. June comes, no word from heavys, I email for an update. Shipping started on april 28th, and I can now expect mine to ship sometime in the next 8 weeks [june-july]. If shipping began on april 28th I'd expect someone to have received these headphones and done a review on them considering how long they have been anticipated.  They are still selling preorder eventhough they are shipping? I imagine they are using the money from preorders to fund advertising to collect more preorders in hopes of never delivering, or not delivering on quality. This company/product is a scam. Do not fall for it. Get your money back before its too late."

This is irrelevant for my review.It took them over 5 months from \u201eyour headphones are ready for shipment\u201c until we actually received them. During that time the pi**-poor communication skills and the arrogance of the so-called customer service showed the sad truth behind heavys: as long as they get their money, those who pay it and their rights or feelings don\u2019t matter. Whatsoever. We didn\u2019t get a functioning tracking number and our package ended up in a holding facility - which resulted in almost 30\u20ac of additional fees. Thank you heavys! On top of customs, not customs as such.The headphones themselves are quite good, although the hell blocker is a non functional joke of a sales pitch. It literally doesn\u2019t do anything. On both pairs we ordered\u2026I have no urge to contact the people at heavys again to be ridiculed and pi**ed off. I will sell mine, I simply do not want to endorse this brand at all. Creating a good product isn\u2019t everything. Throughout their journey the people at heavys have forgotten who they owe their initial success to. Sad quintessence of almost 2 years of waiting.EDIT: Heavy's: your message is the most generic blabla and actually quite appalling. Too little, too late. No one cared when it mattered the most. Why should I waste my time on this now?As I said, I will not endorse your brand anymore and you have lost the faith and support of an entire group of people over here. The people who had the displeasure to be in contact with your so-called customer support on Kickstarter all report the same - as clearly visible on here. I would fire them straight away. If the headphones would work well at least, that'd be one thing but those things are not anywhere near what was promised, way too big and heavy and the most appealing function - for me and my husband - the hellblocker - is just a nice word you implemented. No function.But whatever I am writing here will not change anything anyways. You've \"made it\". Your brand is out there and there are enough people (ohhh wheee: famous ones, too!) endorsing and celebrating you. Congrats. Why on earth should this matter to you at this point?I don't like being held for stupid. You could have helped when I had asked you for help. Instead I was ridiculed and actively ignored. You showed a very ugly face throughout the process. So: no thanks Heavy's. I'm very much done with you."

As far as I can tell you're still prototyping the design.Wes Ewingabout 6 hours agoProgress is progress! Good reminder about supply chain challenges. My prediction is that these may start to ship in 2023 Q1. Only time will tell.Stephen DisneySuperbackerabout 6 hours agoGuys... Cross your fingers for Summer 2023... Calling it.Vulkandrabout 7 hours agoSo are we still on track for November 17th? Because i assumed the delay was to make sure production is done by mid October and they can arrive by mid November, but by the looks of things, full production hasn't even started and we're halfway through September. This is very little time to still be adjusting the hinge and sound and still production done for a November release. We going to get another delay at the start of November?Chris Mascatelloabout 8 hours agoI can't help but be concerned that we are still WAYS away from shipping product. These seem like mid-Beta stage tweaks coming out of the R&D shop via 3D printing. Head-clamp pressure increase via the main headband, modified hinges, and physical EQ plates are not simple adjustments and would certainly need to clear at least one round of QC manufacturing in China before being \"locked\". While these tweaks will be beneficial to the finished product and see us all from getting pre-Beta-grade units as the \"finished\" product, I do think we need and deserve a truthful update on the production schedule.Gerald Habout 8 hours agoThanks for the Update and unfortunately I agree with Chris. You are working on the weakest points, which are the hinges, but also want to change the pressure of the head-clamp, which will make the hinges weak again. Also the video just stopped after 3:46 when Axel was talking about the PCB?!?! November 2022 is very challanging goal for the shipment, also it is black friday and something following on a monday, meaning the chaotic global shipment will get more crazy.Gal Langfordabout 8 hours agoI unfortunately am also agreeing on this. I feel like the updates are not consistent, I understand things change, but I can't help but being skeptical, I backed this project for a promise for an amazing cutting edge product, I hope we will actually get it, I am a little concerned for what our friends are saying here."

I will be returning my Heavy\u2019s and have already replaced them with a new pair of Skullcandy Crusher ANC2\u2019s.The difference is night and day and they come with an app that allows you to customize the sound of the headphones completely.I wanted these to be good, but they just weren\u2019t.

          "Contenu": "These headphones, they're not living up to the promises and claims. The marketing had me thinking I'd be getting some top-notch sound (for this price-range in headphones), but, truth be told, they've left me feeling a bit scammed. And let me tell you, as a bassist, the disappointment is real.I was pumped about these headphones, thinking they'd give me that high-resolution sound without burning a hole in my pocket. But nope, wrong call. The bass, especially in metal music, is all over the place - messy and muffled. It's like they're missing the memo on what good bass should sound like.And can we talk about the price? It's way off the mark for what you're getting. I was expecting a sweet deal, but now I'm just regretting the whole purchase. The sound quality, especially in the bass, is just not cutting it, and to top it off, it feels like they slapped on an extra cost for no good reason.I was hoping for that perfect combo of affordable and killer sound, but these headphones missed the mark big time. As a bassist, I need that low end to hit just right, and these headphones are nowhere close. It's like gearing up for an epic bass solo and getting a lackluster rumble instead.If you're into music, especially the heavy stuff, these headphones might not be your best bet. The sound quality is a miss, and the price feels like a punch in the gut. Save yourself the disappointment and look elsewhere if you're after a truly immersive audio experience.In general, I think Heavys is more about marketing than really delivering improvement on listening experience for metalheads...Hopefully, @Heavys, can you fix the sound issues with a decent app. I am truly not the only one with this issue... A decent equalizer to balance the sound"

With power off or on they sound muddy and thick as pig dung (this is not the word I wanted to use, but Trustpilot censored that).- BT is somewhat better. Cycling through different available A2DP codecs the sound is salvageable. Will have to try some EQ or wait for the app.- USB-C (I'm using my own 240W rated cable. Didn't even unpack the one it came with) is comparable to BT.So was it worth the money and the wait? No, not really... in this price range anyone can get a pair of decent headphones that perform as well, if not better, with arguably better \"user interface\" and customer support, and with added benefit of not having to waist 2 years.Update 2023-10-30I've been listening to metal for 3 decades and all of a sudden, according to Heavys, I don't know what metal is suppose to sound like? Well I'm sure metal is not suppose to sound like whatever comes out of H1H, thats for sure."

          "Contenu": "The headphones themselves have been fine. I expected to be a bit more wowed given the hype, but I suppose that's on me for buying into it a bit too much. Out of the box they sounded pretty muddled, but thankfully they sounded much better after using an equalizer. Still, not what you'd want from a set of headphones supposedly designed for exactly the type of music you're using them for.On the other hand, the way that Heavys conducted themselves over the course of fulfilling their Kickstarter campaign only became more disappointing over time. I'm not even upset by the delays (every campaign these days suffers from them), but rather that they'd only announce them as they missed their own deadlines. At some point (backer update #24 on Kickstarter), they even admitted that the process typically takes 2-3 years, yet for some reason thought their \"optimism\" would make fulfillment within a year realistic. I'm not sure how many crowdfunding campaign runners need to hear it, but backers don't want optimistic timelines, we want realistic ones. I'd rather be told upfront that something will take 2-3 years to happen and be happily surprised if it comes in a little sooner than have the timeline pushed back over and over. Even over the course of shipping they've done so, saying first that everything will ship over the course of April to June. Then the next month for sure. Then the next. Come October 2023, there are still campaign backers who don't have their headphones and there's been no communication from the campaign since July. Not to mention that people who purchased via retail were getting their headphones before many backers. And they refused to give the actual numbers of units shipped/delivered, apparently proprietary information. I've had more than one other crowdfunding campaign (ones that were much larger than this one) able to give updates every 2 weeks (even if there wasn't much to say) and even tell backers how many units were processed and delivered in each region.Heavys could've kept a lot of goodwill by just being honest about the effort it'd take them to develop and ship. They only celebrated successes (that mainly came from early reviewers/people who got lucky enough to actually get their headphones delivered on time), but refuse to face their failures and admit them. The final product is ok (and when's the app coming?), but after this campaign, they sure won't be getting me as a return customer."

Second, plugging them require a 2.5mm-3.5mm micro cable (like SH Headphoens), it degrades sounds quality vs Bluetooth (?!?) and brings inconsistent sound from left and right until you find the sweet spot for the headphone ends (2.5mm).

Unfortunatelly, that's not the case here, as the bass still swallows everything and the \"being in concert\" feature of spatial sound detracts from the experience more than its worth. On top of that, the earphones are literally heavy on the head, cumbersome and not very comfortable."

Music and movies sound good but as soon as you get to about 75% max volume you get distortions in the audio.The 4 speakers is a little gimmicky to be honest. I've had other multi speaker headphones in the past and they were the same. It's just too hard to differentiate the different speakers with them so close to your ears.You have to be a little carefully when pulling the headset off your head cause the small tweeters can catch your ear.All in all I just can't justify 300$ price point when there are way more feature packed headphones out there for cheaper."

          "Contenu": "I was curious about HEAVYS' novel approach to its design and, as a fan of Sennheiser headphones, backed the project due to Axel Grell's involvement in its design.I must say, out of the box, I found the HEAVYS H1H too dark, with some muddying of the low-end, possibly due to the way it was tuned, affecting the mid and higher frequencies. As such, EQ is essential, and once a relatively flat response with a slight bass shelf is dialled in, the outcome is quite satisfactory - they will also go quite loud! However, not having a dedicated app (for mobile use) with EQ is a bit of a blow.On a more positive note, the user interface is great, they are comfortable, folds to a compact size for travelling, and have superb battery life. The build quality is good too. However, one could do without the power on-off confirmation, which may be replaced by a simple two-tone notification.Is a mobile app (for Android 8.0+ and iOS) on the horizon? Now that will be a very useful feature."

I think I was able to get some interesting headphones after waiting so long.It's well made, doesn't look cheap, and feels comfortable to wear.I think the ANC effect is appropriate and will not cause discomfort to many people.However, unfortunately the sound was not to my liking.Since it's only for heavy metal, I think you can enjoy the experience of being at a live venue when you play it at high volume. Those who gave it a high rating are definitely correct.However, I feel that the overall clarity is lacking, the sound is cloudy, the resolution is poor, and the presentation is lacking. Even in metal, some songs had mixed instruments that made me feel uncomfortable. This may be a matter of my preference rather than the good or bad of H1H.Active (Bluetooth or USB-C) mode is better, but Passive Analog Mode, which uses an AUX cable, has a noticeable downside.The sounds in active mode and passive analog mode are different. Passive analog mode feels unoptimized. Unlike regular headphones, the H1H has eight drivers, so it may be difficult to demonstrate its true potential in passive analog mode that does not utilize the H1H's optimized built-in DAC.By the way, if I use a third-party equalizer, I can get the sound closer to my preference, but that's a problem because I lose the flavor of the H1H. it's difficult."

I was rewarded these headphones through the poorly mis-managed Kickstarter campaign. Pros: -Great overall range of sound ($150-200 range)-earcup comfort and size is excellent-overall build and materials feel very high quality-Transparent Mode is very good-ability to use it powered or un-powered (w/ aux cord)-Battery life is extremely long, even with high volumesCons: -Size of aviation headset (very large profile)-has significant weight that will tax your neck -imperfect sound profile (muddied sound at times)-Hell Blocker NC is not robust as competitors-Significant sound bleed-out from earcups on higher volumesOverall Impression: Heavys is a new company that fast-tracked the development and production of the H1H and it shows. These clunky, unapologetic headsets are either going to give the sound you want or they are not. If these are the most expensive headphone you've ever bought, they will impress you. If you already have $200-$300 headphones, you might have issues with the sound quality. The battery is robust and will allow you to travel without fear of needing to charge it during long flights, but the weight and design of the headphones can be taxing on your head and neck. Using the headphones for longer than three hours resulted in neck strain and headaches. Recommendation: There are very good headphones in the same price range. Heavys has the gimmick of 8 drivers but that doesn't mean the end-all-be-all to great sound quality. Shop around before settling on these \"still developing\" headphones."

They seem to work better for a lot of the industrial music I listen to. Definitely not what I was hoping for but I gave it a shot. I think for the money, there are better headphones out there. I\u2019m just glad I was an early bird backer so I saved a bunch of money. At full retail, I cannot imagine anyone being happy with these as metal-specific headphones. Apparently there is an app coming that will allow EQ tweaks, but for now, there is nothing like that. While the noise cancellation is quite good, I am horribly annoyed by the stupid voice that announces every time I turn the headphones and noise cancellation on or off. It\u2019s loud, intrusive and ridiculous."

First, my Heavys often produce a \"crackling\" sound - sort of a distortion or feedback, which is very distracting and disorienting while you're listening to music. Feels like a manufacturing fault. Second, the \"doom voice\" that gives spoken status updates such as \"POWER ON\" or \"HELL BLOCKER ACTIVATED\" - while amusing, in a corny way - is always set to the same volume level, which is quite loud. It's so loud that I have to take the Heavys off first before I do anything that will trigger the voice, because it hurts my ears. This is especially noticable if you're listening to music on lower volume (yes, even metalheads do this sometimes!). Ironically, if you turn the volume down TOO low, you will be greeted by the doom voice with a \"MINIMUM VOLUME\" warning that might blow you through the ceiling if you aren't expecting it, and also seems totally unnecessary. (Note: this only happens when using the on-headset volume knob. The same applies for \"MAXIMUM VOLUME,\" but at that point it hardly matters). Lastly, and this may be nitpicking, but the headset is very large. Almost comically large. I feel a bit silly wearing it in public.Overall decent headphones for the price, but buyer beware."

Sound : pretty good is full and rich better than Beats but not as good as the Parrot, even with different range can compete and in some way is better than the Bose qc. My really own personal test song began one of Metallica , with the Parrot Zik you can clearly hear the ghost track of Jason\u2019s bass.The noise reduction is pretty good not as the Bose but better than the others.Design : the main problem to me is here, respecting the name the headphone are heavy, too much heavy .About the design still don\u2019t know if I like it or not, I love matte finish but this looks like a little cheaper than expected, I hope, I really hope that this material like in some other brands will not become \u201cgluey\u201din the future. For sure I don\u2019t like the \u201cfixed\u201d battery I\u2019m not disappointed by this headphone but for the moment Bose quiet comfort for various reasons will remain my main one I\u2019ll use heavys for sure at home."

          "Contenu": "I was really stoked when this first caught my attention on kick starter.  It was my first experience with KS.  I was very pleased with the abundance of updates and not at all bothered by the delays in development because I get it.  However, after I informed them I was going to have my mail forwarded (before they actually shipped it) they decided to ship it via a USPS method that sent it around the United States before \u201cdestroying\u201d it per the the terms of the cheaper shipping price.  Needless to say I was livid.  However, several weeks later they made it right and shipped another pair that finally made it. For that, I cannot give 5 stars.Now for the product review:The headphones are Heavy literally as well as figuratively.  They are monstrous.  But I guess they need to be to package all of the drivers/speakers in them.  They sound good, but they bring out the bad as well as the good in whatever you play through them.  If a band has a well mastered album, it sounds great.  But if you play a favorite metal album from the 80\u2019s that wasn\u2019t produced by a god, then it sounds muddy. In general, the mids really come through on these.To be fair, I am still getting used to them, but would never wear them in public because they are awkwardly huge.  It is a great idea and lots of good technology going on, just need to make the design more efficient.  Will be following these guys to see what the Gen 2 design brings\u2026."

          "Contenu": "I genuinely appreciate that these are an interesting pair of headphones. It's just that gaming headphones from other competing brands are much better. The sound design of \"Heavys\" aren't what I hear from the other headphones and the drivers from Heavys have too much bass, muddling the audio and you'll need to use an external equalizer like from the Amazon Music app. Using that equalizer actually improved the audio from the Heavys and improved what the headphones are capable.  A great tip on the Amazon Music app for the equalizer settings use \"Classical\" or Custom and then Set the Sliders like this (60Hz is Bass so raise or lower to your like) (230Hz closer to center or lower depending on the other sliders) (910Hz this one seems to control the vocals, lower this to clear up vocals, raising it seems to mix the instrumental too much) (4kHz seems to work much like 910Hz so I just keep it the same as 910Hz) (14kHz is actually what makes the audio sound wider or something clearer? Lowering 14kHz makes the audio worst, so slide up and leave it there) Some nitpicks are on the features of the headphones, there's a loud voiceover when switching through modes very unique but just loud. Apparently the cables are separate from the main buy price of the product which is very ridiculous. The \"tweeters\" on the inside of the headphones provide no audible difference to audio or \"soundstage\" to what I can hear... I have use Phone audio and even CD player audio I thought maybe they provide higher acoustics or improvement on audio from guitars and vocals but nothing to what i can hear. Also, the cables, with the analog cable you can only use the Company own cable, it's a \"2mm into 3mm\" cable. You can't use \"high end\" cables that are \"3mm into 3mm\".Overall the headphones are an incredible build it's just that most people might find the Unboxing result a bit of a let down.Another Note the cable needs to be pressed into the headset until the \"click\" or full stop... Otherwise it's not appropriate working"

          "Contenu": "I've had my Heavys in hand for a few months now and have used them enough to develop some thoughts. The Good1) The build quality does seem pretty decent.  They feel substantial in the hand and components seem to fit together well.  They don't feel cheap2) Battery life is really good.  I haven't had an opportunity to run them out, but my impression is no one will be complaining about battery charge issuesThe OK1) Overall, the cans fit well with decent clamping force and are reasonably comfortable.  Unfortunately, I'd be happier with a little less clamp.  2) The Optimus Prime announcement voice - cute for the first dozen times, then gets old.  At least turn the volume down on it.The Not So Good1) Sound quality.  I realize we all perceive sound differently and have different expectations of sound equipment, but out of the box these sound terrible to me.  The overall voicing is extremely bass heavy and muffled at the expense of mids and upper registers.  I am surprised the company got the initial voicing so wrong with these.Some seem to love it, some don't - I'm in the latter camp.  The good news is if you are connecting your streaming service through a phone, there are a number of EQ apps that will work to make these sound serviceable. I'm running Poweramp and it is worth the investment in time to bring the sound profile around to something a little more neutral.I'm more of a home audio listener than a headphone guy, but my final impression is that Heavys may be worthy of consideration for other similarly spec'd headphones in this price range.  I'd probably give 3.5 stars, but not an optionEdit - I've cleaned up a number of issues with some suggestions from others and the application of some careful parametric eq bands.  There is still some lack of presence, but still more than acceptable at this price point.  Consequently, I've updated my rating to 4 stars.  Without eq, this would be a one star review.Edit 2:  Going to have to bring this down to a 3 star again.  I'm finding the clamping force on my head is just too aggressive to wear for more than an hour at a time."

I wore my Heavys all day yesterday without any ear pain or other issues.I also own a pair of Sennheiser Momentum 3 headphones and will use those for comparison. The Sennheisers have more clarity in the audio, but the Heavys sound louder and more energetic. The Heavys have reduced treble and more emphasis on bass, which I like because it allows you to listen at higher volumes without getting any high-pitched treble screeching in your ears. You aren't getting a \"neutral\" sound with the Heavys, but they are fun to listen to.My only complaint is something that many others might view as a positive: It sounds like the noise cancelling function is on all the time, even when I turn noise cancelling off. Maybe I have a defective pair or something, but I hear no difference at all between noise cancelling and regular mode. The only way I could turn the noise cancelling off was by turning off the headphones completely and using a wired connection.Overall, I'm enjoying these so far and think they will only get better once the app is rolled out."

Its not a good fit and cant do anything to make it tighter. Sure its very comfortable, but if i look down, or up. It slides off my head, which is annoying if im moving about the house or outside with these on. And i wish something could be done about it. But, overall a solid headset!"

The sound quality is great, with you truly feeling like you are at a metal concert without the music getting so loud it hurts your eardrums. The firmware on the device could use a little bit of work with the polishing. Three examples come to mind;When you turn on the headphones and go to the noise canceling mode as they coined \u201cHell Blockers\u201d (very rad name in my opinion) the headphones give the message \u201cHell Blockers Activated\u201d. When you boot the headphones right into the hell blocker mode it will repeat the messages that were shown multiple times. Secondly, when you are at minimum volume it will play the message \u201cMinimum Volume\u201d at a rather high volume, which is a pretty big shock to my ears whenever it happens without me expecting. Thirdly, pretty minor actually, the headphones have a pretty large band on them so if you\u2019re walking around with them on or if you move your head a lot they are pretty liable to fall off and they generally just feel loose while wearing them."

Pure bassy sound, which could be improved by EQ and detailed software set up.From the cons: Undefined timeframe for the delivery (but the bakers waited around 2 years, so my case is quite fast). And the most bad surprise: the shipment was sent from Hong Kong and additionally to product's costs and delivery I had to pay 50 euros of VAT&customs duty (because the product came outside EU), these specific numbers are valid for Spain and might vary depending on country. This was really an unexpected surprise. I really enjoyed the sound of headphones, brutal voice if included assistant and especially the Hell Blocker and Transparent modes, which are very useful on outside and on the street/public transport.So if you are OK with these cons and able to set them up precisely for a perfect sound and wait how long's needed, I don't think you can find something nice for such a price. I am using them with Android and BlackPlayer with build-in EQ, but it's only the first day so far. I'll update my review later after I find a perfect set up."

I expect these will last for many years to come, and I\u2019m excited to have them. After some equalizer work, they sound good to me. My only point of criticism: I thought out of the box the sound was muddy and not well suited for metal. Nothing a little work with EQ can\u2019t fix. Apple has several presets that suffice (e.g., electronic), and even further improvements can be made manually if one is willing to. I\u2019m not the engineer(s) of these headphones, and I\u2019m very ignorant about how sound signatures are developed for out of the box. If they could arrive out of the box sounding more suitable to metal with more clarity, I think some folks would feel less shocked, like I did. These headphones are an investment (and a good one at that), but if they could sound better for metal out of the box, I think that would be an improvement. I\u2019ve read some angry posts on Reddit, but I don\u2019t think they understand that EQ can fix their dissatisfactions. I hope this makes sense."

These are sitting in your chair and enjoying your Undeath live album turning on your record player kind of headphones. And using 2.5 feels like a ploy by them so you'll buy their overpriced cords. The latter reasoning making my disappointment more legitimate.Also, I scrolled through some of the negative reviews and found some of the pettiest crap I've ever seen. Some complaining that the voice was 'too loud'. If your ears aren't irreparably damaged from years of listening to Metal, then wth did you buy heavy metal headphones for!?"

Bluetooth for the gym and chores, analog and/or digital connections for streaming and gaming.  They are a tad heavy(no pun intended) they tend to slide off of im doing any exercises at the gym that require me to be in anything but an upright position, easy enough to work around that.  Only dropped 5hem once so far in the 2 months I've had them and only a small scuff to show for it.  Sound quality, well nothing to say other than a 12/10.  Great bass without being overpowering.  Love the extra tweeters and their forward relocation. Very big, full sound.  Even does a decent job at making up for the poor sound quality of some audio files and low reception area where your Plex/Spotify streaming might start to degrade. They fit very well for their size.  My biggest concern is the hinge for folding the ear cups, I haven't had any issues but I always feel like I'm about to break something when I unfold them.  Let me be clear, they don't feel \"cheap\" but just something about the way the hinge lock into position.  But for that I took away one star.  I'm careful with my property but I don't like feeling like I have to be unnecessarily overprotective.  I would give 4.5 stars but this survey doesn't allow 1/2 stars.  Great product!!

There were obvious delays in creating and marketing a complex brand new item from scratch, and of course, there are some minor implementation issues that still need ironing out, but the engineering team behind Heavys has done a magnificent job.

I feel there is a bit of a lack of technical documentation or support with regards to using these for digital on a PC, since when it is plugged in, Windows 11 has no clue what the device is as the device does not report what it is to the system. I reached out to Heavy's for a driver and got no response. This could easily be a 5-star rating with a PC driver and an app that lets you get a custom sound profile directly to the headphone as most equalizers in apps are absolutely terrible and distort your sound and degrades the sound quality substantially."

No problems with mobile devices whatsoever- you have a move were you can enable the microphones to overcome the noise blocking. The mode works well, but you have to press two buttons at once and don't get any audio feedback of it's turned on or notHope I could help you a bit"

If you are looking for thumping drums, hard riffs and screaming vocals with a new set of headphone's earmuffs vibrating off your head (ALL at the same time) then look no more! Be warned though this product is NOT for crisp treble or smooth relaxing vocal tones (EG: Classical, etc) If you are a serious Audiophile you'll most likely feel let down, yet....Should you be a Heavy Metal / Hard Rock enthusiast you ain't gonna add these to your Headphone collection for anything else other than a 'full on' head banging, devil horns salute  experience. That my heavy metal / Hard Rock friend is exactly what you'll get. I really hope Heavys put this same recipe into a pair of earbuds with 10-12mm drivers for their next venture, I have a feeling it's already on the horizon due to the massive TWS earbud market they'd be silly not to put a little R&D into a future related product with a dedicated App. The only let downs (very minor) and reason for one star less in my review is the fiddly little buttons and knobs placed on the underside of the right ear cup. They could be either slightly larger or have some rubberised or textured grip and spaced a little further apart seeing they are so small. One other thing is the ANC switch design hasn't been completly or thoroughly thought through, the user can easily toggle the headphones off when in Bluetooth mode is switched in the opposite direction. I am sure these minor faults will be corrected for version 2.0 (perhaps move some switches to the upper fork on either or both sides of the ear cups?) That would make the Heavys even more unique and intuitive to everything else on the market. I'd also love to see a flaming Red devils horns hand \ud83e\udd18 logo on the ear cup as a new earcup design housing either a button styled battery with small toggle on/off switch to power that glowing logo OR a 'glow in the dark' logo powered by UV flashlight or naturally powered by the sun after a few hours using luminescent liquid / material. Attention Heavys R&D....Check out The Voltage Ring (another KS project some years ago) for an example of that technology. I think the later rather than the former may be an easier process? Or perhaps give the Heavys community a say or which they'd prefer if you are considering this option? Anyway to end this review if you are second guessing yourself in picking up a pair of Heavys then don't just do it as you just won't find a listening experience anywhere else in the flooded Headphone market. Cannot wait for the earbuds to drop hopefully in the near future. We'll done to Axcel and his entire engineering crew, hats off to a job very well done! Flash... OUT"

          "Contenu": "Pros:Sound is incredible, which is obviously the most important thing. I turned the lower frequencies down just a tiny bit on my EQ, because I found the bass was causing the guitars (in death, black, melodeath, thrash metal) to be a little overshadowed and muddy. But with a small adjustment, it sounds perfect to my taste.The earcups are super comfortable, which is the 2nd most important thing.HB mode works really well, comparable to the active noise cancelling I've had with Bose in the past.The \"listening\" (whatever it's called that lets outside sound in) mode is also good.Cons:The main con is this: The vocal status announcements are LOUD and INTRUSIVE. I think they're a little overkill. But the worst offenders are when you turn HB on/off. The worst part of listening to music, is having a loud interruption that shouts \"HELLBLOCKER (DE)ACTIVATED\". The 2nd thing, which might be even more counterintuitive, is when you roll the volume down to zero, a LOUD voice booms MINIMUM VOLUME. C'mon, I literally am trying to make the volume go lower, I don't need a sudden, much louder than level-1 volume voice yelling at me. Imagine if every time you muted your TV, the TV announces \"MUTING TV!\" This is especially annoying, because I'm often in public, on a train or something, and I need to adjust my volume without looking at my phone, so I'd rather not be startled when I accidentally bottom out. Hopefully, an update can fix that. Or maybe you'll release an app to make adjustments or something."

          "Contenu": "I have had the Heavys headphones for a few weeks now, and I haven't tested all the features yet, but I have been enjoying the headphones a great deal. I do think there are some drawbacks, they are a bit large for my head even in the tightest position (and my head is not small), and they do seem a little too bass-heavy, but they do still have a good enough response that makes metal, and actually other music (particularly some electronic stuff I happened across) shine. They even work well for spoken word content on YouTube. The Bluetooth connectivity seems to be extremely good, in fact too good. I live in a small apartment and the Heavys are paired with an iPad and a MacBook Pro. When I power them on, they will often connect to both if the MacBook isn't completely shut down even if the MacBook is dozens of feet away behind a wall. When this happens, I don't get audio on the iPad. I haven't tested the analog connectivity, or the USB-C connectivity, or the mic. They do seem to last a good long time on a single charge, and they feel like a premium and thoughtfully constructed product. It did take a along time for me to receive them but I'm generally pretty patient with Kickstarter projects because unforeseen things can and do happen. In all, I do recommend the product, but I would probably advocate for holding off until they are fulfilling orders more consistently, and for any pending firmware updates that may improve audio or connectivity."

          "Contenu": "Fit:The headphones offer a sleek design with a good balance of materials and textures. However, there is a noticeable tightness when wearing glasses, and the ear cups could benefit from a slight enlargement of 1-3mm to accommodate larger ears. The foam lacks sufficient padding for extended wear.Buttons:One area for improvement is the height of the play/volume control button compared to the adjacent buttons. This height difference is not significant, causing difficulty for users with larger fingers. It results in accidental clicks on smaller buttons or a challenge in gripping the center button due to overlap from the shells. It's recommended to increase the height of the center button, change its shape to an oval for improved usability, and make notches the shells around button placements.Audio:While the sound quality is excellent, there is room for enhancement. Adding support for (HIFI) Bluetooth codecs such as aptX Lossless and LDAC/LHDC would allow the headphones to utilize the potential of the eight drivers fully.Cable:The choice of material for the cable's outer jack is less than ideal. Additionally, the cable is too short, tends to tangle easily, and has a less secure connection to the headphones. This can lead to sound issues with even a slight cable tug. My listening experience changed drastically when I replaced the supplied cable with a balanced cable. The difference is night and day!In conclusion, the headphones offer a sleek design and good sound quality but have several areas for improvement, and addressing them would undoubtedly position the headphones as a competitive option with higher-priced headphones."

          "Contenu": "Truly a 5 star product being a newly launched design. Giving 4 stars, as I believe in continual improvement. Keep going, and stand by the values that got you to where you are.What I Love (Pros):4 Drivers per ear, including 2 tweeters - This was my dream for a long time to have the sound stage capability that these headphones have. The foundation is here!Comfort - Yes, yes, yesButtons & Ergonomics - Nicely done, intuitive, excellent feedback from the controls.Noise Canceling - WOW......they nailed it. Some of the best noise canceling I've experienced, and I have A320 Bose for flying planes. I've been using these while mowing the lawn and using other yard products....absolutely amazing.Bluetooth - It connects to two devices, so when I forget to disconnect my phone or tablet I don't have to get up and find where the other device is to disconnect it.....how did you manage that? :). Bluetooth distance - Also wow.What I hope to see added & improved:Software/App to control features:I would like to be able to disable the bluetooth connected light, the only thing that stops me from using these in bed is that the light wakes up my wife.I'd like to be able to control the volume, or disable the \"Power On\" / \"Hellblocker Activated\". Love the metal voice, and it's cool as heck but it's a bit too loud. Equalizer: PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE :) I know Axle is a great sound engineer but everyone perceives sound a little differently, and unfortunately there is no standard when mixing music. I had to pay for and download an equalizer app, but it's not 100% compatible. I would love for the Heavys team to design and offer their own equalizer."

          "Contenu": "Despite the delivery delays, they had a proactive communication regarding the whole shipping process, which was specially important during the custom duties.For a first in hands experience in the Headphones segment, the Heavys H1H sound a bit daunting when it comes to weight and size when compared with their peers. The jack input is a bit small to find when you are plugging in with your heaphones already set and it may take some time to search with your fingers until you find it.These are minor turnarounds when compared with the experience of the heaphones - they really live up to their name. The sound depth is amazing no matter what music you are listening to (atmospheric and ambient sounds are a really imersive experience) and the volume does not sound too agressive to your ears. Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) is also available, but the earcups are so robust and good that passive sound isolation is self sufficient for the majority of your use scenarios.In short, the H1H are a good start for a newly created company and a great option if you want to explore beyond the brands already established in the market. The Heavys are also developing an equalizer application that will allow you to adjust your sound settings in the future and allow to explore further the potential output of your headphones - give them a try!"

From design, to built and sound, no corners have been cut short. Albeit their heavy weight, they are very comfortable. Their over the ear deep cup design provides great sound isolation on its own, making the active noise cancelation unnecessary in most environments. Their 50 hours battery autonomy, 40 hours with ANC, is also excellent. Combining them with an equalizer app really shows their awesome potential. I am looking forward to Heavys releasing their own app. They do sound more dynamic at medium to loud volumes than they do at low volumes. Overall, I am really impressed by this product and very glad to have backed such an awesome project! Rock on Heavys!"

I've got to say it was worth the wait and worth the time for me to bother with a review. Super happy with these and think they punch well above their weight (and price range). Battery life is awesome, they sound great, plenty of distortion free bass with decent mids and highs. I find the volume to be the perfect amount for me - any higher would be fatiguing. I wear these on the ride on mower mostly and they almost cut out the sound of the engine completely with the noise cancelling activated.Only recommendation for future improvement would be to allow for an extra 10-20mm of travel in the head band to increase clamping pressure for my skinny head. Definitely not a deal breaker but it does mean it can slip forward when I look down while doing activities around the house.Super happy and 100% recommend."

The built-in Hellblocker noise cancellation works well for keeping rumbly sources from interfering and I could see these being a good option when traveling.  The bluetooth range is excellent, and having a passive option is really nice too, as well as the ability to use them as a DAC to plug directly into the computer.

Bluetooth connectivity is very quick. Wearing comfort and operation are great. But the headphones are big, so I will not wear them outside, but that\u2019s just a matter of taste. With a head circumference less than 56cm the headband is at it\u2018s minimum position and shaky while headbanging. In total these headphones can easily keep up with much more expensive headphones from known big brands. So my overall result is 8,5 of 10 points, just based on the sound 10 of 10 points.

          "Contenu": "I have had these for about 2 weeks now and I have to vouch for these headphones. The sound quality is beyond any I have owned in the past. Hell blocker mode puts you into a solid sound proof room where you can hear each song on a different level. The beauty of these headphones it allows you to hear the imperfections of each song which gives you a different take of the actual songs and the true talent that the musicians have. I feel these headphones are not just for heavy metal, they make EDM, pop and rock sound solid. The bass really stands put and is smooth with very nice clears and mids. They don't have the option for modifying the low mid and high range at this time but I don't feel that is a deal breaker for me. Over all for the price these headphones are worth it in my opinion but I'd commend you to try them for yourselves."

I have also used them to listen to pop, alternative, EDM, and other music. They sound good through the headphones too. I can hear the various elements of the music through them. The headphones are really well built. They are a bit heavy in weight so I wouldn't recommend them for wearing on a daily walk or when you are moving around. They are best used when you are sitting at home listening to your favorite music. I use them when they are connected through Bluetooth to my phone. They have also included a jack and cable in case a person wants to physically connect the headphones to a sound source. This is a nice touch as many companies have done away with physical connections."

Not anymore...these headphones were the best purchase i made in audio. I've had the major top brands, from traditional cup earphones to earbuds,  and HEAVY'S is the one clear winner. The headband and cups are strong and durable, the hardshell case offers great protection when not in use, the battery life is perfect, and overall construction is unlike anything else ive had for personal audio. No matter what genre you like (even though they are designed for heavy metal) the sound quality / clarity and loudness of these are perfect for any genre you enjoy. From death metal, grindcore, hardcore punk, all the way to country, hip hop, rap, classical, spoken word, jazz / blues, these bad boys deliver EXACTLY what you want in headphones. The bluetooth connection is simple and easy and even make great headphones for gaming and taking phone calls. The battery life exceeded my expectations even at high volume. If you're looking for durability, clarity, loudness, and good battery life - look no further. HEAVY's is all you need for personal audio to be fully immersed in the sounds you enjoy the most in life. Take your audio pleasures to a new level with HEAVY'S."

These are what I was looking for in a pair of headphones.First off, I'm finally getting the volume I was missing in other headphones.  It's such a relief knowing that I don't have to max out the volume and still be wanting more.Secondly, they sound GOOD!  Really good!  Having said that, do I wish that there was an app with an EQ?  Yes, I do.  I love having options and sadly, these don't provide any.  Hopefully that will be rectified in the near future.Another concern is the waterproof/water resistant rating.  As far as I know, they don't have one.  Meaning, don't wear them in the rain or working out.  Even walking my dog during the afternoon can make me sweat, and I'm wary of wearing these.Other than these two gripes, these headphones are perfect for me.  Due to an allergy to nickel, I can't wear wireless earbuds without developing severe ear infections, so headphones are basically my only option.  And these deliver.  Big time."

They are also very comfortable and seem to be very durable and have a nice weight to them. They don\u2019t feel cheap in your hand. There are only 2 issues I have with these headphones. 1. The audible recording you get when you turn them on and when you turn on the \u201chell blocker\u201d noise cancellation. While the deep menacing voice it rather cool it does get bothersome after a while and I wish there were a way to turn it off. 2. The active noise cancellation itself is not that powerful. It does help quiet some unwanted white noise while jamming out to your favorite set list or band, but at the same time it just isn\u2019t powerful enough to block out background noise and nearby conversation. Overall, these headphones crushed it. I\u2019d give them a solid 4.5 out if 5. Definitely worth the wait, the hype, and the money!!"

I've used them on the plane and at the gym and the Active noise control is awesome. Love them, and I'll have to buy a set for my GF since she uses them all the time too.Well done metalheads."

          "Contenu": "The BEST headphones, the ONLY headphones you need to listen to the best music out there. I was a little sceptical about these headphones when I saw the Kickstarter campaign, but I have been blown away with everything they have to offer and am so happy I backed them.The comfort, the style, the sound!Obviously when buying headphones, the first thing you want is the best, clearest quality, and loudest sound and Heavys deliver 200% on that. I have listened to rock/metal from the 70s to the current day to get an idea of the range and quality these headphones offer and am hearing things I hadn't before on songs I've listened to a million times. The comfort is another key aspect and because they are so robust and strong it makes them probably slightly heavier than other headphones, the padding/cushioning makes them incredibly comfy on the top of the head and around the ears which negates the slight heaviness. I've had these headphones for 3 months nearly and used them every day for at least 30 minutes up to 3 hours and the padding has kept its shape.If anyone is considering buying a pair or two or three, of Heavys headphones, I cannot recommend them enough, you will not be disappointed."
