Having recently been forced to close the funding account I was using to pay them, I have tried to use the system to change the cc number. It has failed each time. And while  I just now sent them an email, given the past history I am not expecting a reply. I also agree with the service just recently becoming so horrid. Having been a member for almost 25 years! I can attest to the fact it has not always been so. An example. Even in this forum they mask their email address. What is pr - at - easynews supposed to mean?"

Other than this bull-crap of not answering the service is at least average. Their support link on their main page goes to an error 404 page. I have been with these guys for 17 years and their support has always been poor as they used to have a phone line for support but they got rid of it. I have been without service on an UNLIMITED ANNUAL ACCOUNT for 5 days now and no replies to my emails. I will be cancelling with them and looking for another web based News server if I don't hear from them in the next 48 hours.I will also be contacting the better business bureau of Los Angeles.If they are having covid problems, the least they could do is post a notice on they login page. I am beginning to think the have flown the coup with all their customers money. \"No contact\" is very scary and usually means something shady is going on."

Development took a turn for the worse as the new search facilities are nowhere nearly as useful and although the old ones are still available, they only cover more recent postings.  Completeness of posts is good, but a number of newsgroups seem to have disappeared.  Speeds are mostly good, but this just shows up another aspect that isn't so great, the download limits on the web service.  Given the Internet speeds available these days, using up an entire month's allocation in about an hour is insane!  While larger allocations can be purchased, it starts to get too expensive.  Unlimited NNTP access is available, but the only reason to prefer Easynews is the web interface and search.  I will be changing to another service as soon as I can find one meeting my requirements."

The only reason I give 4 instead of 5 stars is that sometimes Easynews support can come off as\u2026adversarial. To be fair, I\u2019ve only ever had to contact them 2 or 3 times\u2026ever. And to be even more fair, it has been YEARS since I\u2019ve had to request support. But the times I did, there was always at least a little bit of struggle and pushback. But, the fact that I\u2019ve only needed to use them 2/3 times in probably 22+/- years is a testament to how well they do their jobs on the back end. Highly recommended!"

I have a very high level of technical skills. If I contact support, it is because of an issue that cannot be resolved easily, and I should not receive a scripted answer.2. There have been service outages with no website updates or other notification to customers.3. Easynews rarely notifies members of issues or updates. Their support forum has been closed for years, as has their blog. I maybe receive one email per year from them."

I use it regularly (mostly to watch video when on the road) but its hard to tell if its trustworthy/nolog and what the parentage of the company is (who are the actual exit nodes they are reselling), which is worrisome.
