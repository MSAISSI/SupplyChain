The call connections to destinations via access numbers do not always work and thus, if on pay as you go plan, losing mobile credit is inevitable. Also according to my observation, if I start using calls to a particular destination for about a week I notice a price hike to this destination and if stop using it the price goes down in a few weeks time. So Phoneclub is not reliable In terms of prices. Phoneclub is no longer competitive with similar providers.However I do not mind to use occasionally, because some of its rates to some destinations I use are bit lower. Overall, I would not mind to give three stars, however for being so clever to play with its rates it is two!  If it keeps happening in future I will be giving 1 star."

We then had to install half a dozen of different browsers, because PhoneClub service was unable to tell us in which browser Java works. We almost gave up. - Luckily, in the last moment we discovered that the \"Pale Moon\" browser works with Java. 3) We then were bombarded with a string of unpleasant echos and repeated, shrill signal tones. So, all in all I cannot say it was easy to make it work. - At least the good people at PhoneClub cared to reward our efforts & waste of time with a 15% discount. They seem to (on the go) monitor and adjusting the sound quality for their customers. Not a bad thing, for lately, the call quality and connection has greatly improved.   :)"
