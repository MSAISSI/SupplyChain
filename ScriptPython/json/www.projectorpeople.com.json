          "Contenu": "I chose these folks over the competition because their web site said they had the projector I wanted in stock, and would ship same day if I ordered before 3pm Eastern.They didn't ship it.When they didn't, I called to follow up.  I was asked a whole bunch of questions that strongly implied that I, the customer, had selected the wrong product.  When I supplied them with the use-case, distance and dimension information they insisted upon, they misinterpreted the manufacturers specifications.  I chose to cancel the order, rather than argue with them, and bought the same product for the same price elsewhere.  I don't need a really bad projector-nanny.  I'd done the math, and even put up the screen and installed an older projector with comparable specs and capabilities to check it out before I selected the product I ordered.  I know what is right for my use-case.  Your job as a retailer is to deliver the product, not withhold it until the customer has satisfied you.  That gets even worse when you don't know what you're doing.  Never again, Projector People!  You wasted my time and frustrated me - the epitome of a lousy customer experience."

It's now july 31st and I am told that I have to wait 2 more weeks...I will essentially lose the good deal that I got on the projector if I cancel. I'm not sure if other vendors had this issue, but they certainly had the same promotion. Will update again if my expected shipping date gets pushed out for a third straight time..."

This time, there were a couple of problems. First, I ordered a demo unit that was supposed to include free shipping. They charged me for shipping. I called customer service and they at least refunded that. When the projector came, it did not have the Wi-Fi dongle or projector mount which was clearly stated in the sale description as included in the demo unit when I purchased the projector.  I figured this was a used demo unit that just happened to have those extra items included. I sent the csr a screenshot of the description.  They failed to honor the deal and said I could pay for them as an additional charge.  They said it was a webmaster mistake. Feels like a bait and switch to me.  I told them their website was still advertising that deal and on other projectors.  I will not do business with them again.  Caveat emptor folks!"

I looked at the box it came in and the box also portrayed no feet. I checked the model and product numbers and they all matched. I contacted customer support and the representative I got was very helpful and polite. He informed me that the company that manufactured the projector stopped making projectors with feet and hadn\u2019t communicated it with Projector People and was not reflected on their website. I asked how the situation can be made right, considering we did not get what we ordered. I asked if an exchange could be done. Got short answers and was told no.

          "Contenu": "I usually do not write reviews but projectorpeople's service was so bad that I had to write one. It all started on Black Friday I saw the Epson 5030ube for a good price on their website with a $200 gift card, 5% discount and a free lamp rebate I pulled the trigger. I got a call the next day from Donna Taylor telling me that the projector was not in stock and will take a month to get ! I said ok ....I can wait since I was getting it at a good price. Checked on their website 2 weeks later the Epson 5030ube still showed as in stock, I contacted Donna immediately she told me they still do not have it in stock , I told her that it was misleading and wrong to have it  on their website as in stock and demanded to cancel my order, she then spoke to her manager and got my projector shipped.  I thought the worse was over...wrong ! when filing for a rebate which had 8 days left to file I found out that the serial number on the invoice was wrong again I contacted Donna and we went back and forth with several emails and after 2 days she finally got customer service to send me the corrected invoice which I mailed to the Epson rebate center but I highly doubt that the mail reached them on time since I havent heard back from them. The final nail in the coffin is the $200 gift card its been 50 days since my credit card was charged and I still havent got the gift card, on contacting Donna and going back and forth in emails she refuses to tell me the ETA of the gift card all she told me was we dont handle mailing the gift card the fulfillment center does  and there is no tracking number for it.  \r I have been plenty patient but I have my limits, seems to me like projector people give you good service only when you are buying from them after that they don't care much. I spoke to my bank and since I haven't got everything I was supposed to get with the projector they have agreed to do a charge back . Will never buy from them again, Beware buyers !"

          "Contenu": "On 8.3.2017 we purchased an Optoma UHD65 Projector, the necessary mounting equipment and an Elite Screen AEON 135\" Zero Edge Screen.  The mount/projector went up with easy - our experience was going quite well until we got to putting the Elite Screen together.  This wasn't our first rodeo - we just finished building this (new) house and had a theater room in our old house (which we still own) that had a Screen Innovations 120\" - we loved this screen - could not have been easier to put together/hang.  First impression on the Elite Screen was the fit/finish/instructions were not great - we had trouble getting the 'seams' on the aluminum flush - and finally had to improvise with black electrician's tape because we were afraid the 'ridge' where the aluminum frame connected would tear the screen material as we stretched it across the frame.   Our frustration didn't stop there - we could not figure out the 'two-sided' tape that was supposed to hold the frame on the screen.  How hard can this be ... we asked ourselves???  I had two helpers - one a mechanical engineer and our son the rocket scientist (yes - he's an aeronautical engineer) - we could NOT get this part of the process completed - the tape was not 'two-sided'!  I called Projector People the next day and asked for help.  They were nice enough to get me on a conference call with the Elite Screen people.  This is where the experience really went downhill.  I was told i could just use the screen as it was (no frame) which didn't seem like an option to me as I bought it for the look of the frame.  Second option was I could go to a hardware store and buy my own tape (seriously???) or glue it???  They made me feel like an idiot because I wasn't willing to 'just go pick up some double sided tape' - didn't seem like a great answer to me.  At this point I wanted nothing to do with Elite Screens - they finally offered to send me out replacement tape - which I declined - I did not want this companies screen in my home theater.   I called the Projector People the following day - expressed my frustrations and made it clear I was not happy with this screen - I wanted to get the screen we had before (Screen Innovations) that performed flawlessly.  No problem they said - but it was going to cost me a pretty hefty re-stocking fee(?).  Yes a re-stocking fee for a product that was defective and I wasn't happy with.My initial response was to throw the Elite Screen in the trash and purchase another Screen Innovations from Best Buy.  Unfortunately that would have meant not only throwing away $500 with it - but the cost of another screen.  Since our 'old' house is on the market I took down the Elite Screen (135\") and put it up at the old house - took the Screen Innovations (120\") and put it up at  the new house.  Unfortunately the 'new' theater was designed around a 135\" screen and the old around a 120\" which meant both projectors had to be moved - ceilings repaired (holes) and seating distances changed.   Had I known Projector People did not have a 100% return policy (especially with a defective product) I would NOT have purchased anything from them.  Very disappointed."

Number two had to have been damaged somewhere. FedEx says maybe Elite is shipping bent stuff .... who knows. Elite screen company in California shifts the blame to the dealer and the dealer shifts the blame to FedEx .... there has got to be common ground somewhere.  I would be ok with a refund and keep the bent screen since I am aleady out the cost and time of 2 separate installations. I have been a long time customer but, when one of the really good guys retired (Michael) the caring for little customers seemed to decline. That's kind of descrimatory if you look at it in one sense of the word. Donna has been nice, but passes the buck. I guess ultimately, I am the loser because I paid for it and still have a damged screen. My customer suffers too ... they still have a bent screen as we wait and wait and wait. Thanks"

Recently, I used their online chat feature to inquire about a projector and didn't receive the most friendly service. I was kind of taken aback by this. The person on the on the other end named \"Lisa\" called me in the middle of our instant message conversation to tell me that basically I was asking too many questions too fast and that she's the only one working there in the evening. First of all, why does the customer care that you are the only person working there? A customer just wants their questions answered. I didn't care if would take her a few minutes to respond on the chat. She tried to make me feel like I was super inconveniencing her for asking questions which was very odd. She kept stressing that she was the only person there like it was my fault I was asking questions. The funniest part is that in the instant messaging she mentioned she can call me when she has more information on the projector, then later she said I can't expect her to call me because they have so many customers that they help that calling someone personally is not possible. Well then why did you offer to call me?! Seriously it was comical. Based on this experience, it has left a seriously sour taste for me and I probably wouldn't do business with them again for this reason. There are so many other authorized projector dealers that are willing to provide excellent customer service and answer your questions in a polite manner."

          "Contenu": "Tl;dr - I'm not one to write reviews often but my experience with Projector People can be summarized as uncaring and incompetent and definitely NOT worth your time. Ordered a HU80KA LG 4K Laser projector with \"guaranteed\" 3-days shipping, it came 30 days later! I reached out to Projector People multiple times that month specifically to my sales rep Sarah Buss-Fonk via phone and email. Not only was she unapologetic for the delay and kept saying it was coming in just 3-more days (untrue), when I asked for a tracking number she gave me one for an accessory that came with it instead. When the projector again didn't come after an additional week's delay, Sarah acknowledged Projector People still hadn't shipped the projector in the first place! Instead of taking responsibility for the mistake, Sarah tried to blame the manufacturer of the projector and recommended I call them to complain (and in the process named the WRONG manufacturer over email proving she wasn't paying any attention). When I explained it wasn't the manufacturer, but Projector People who guaranteed 3-day shipping, she claimed that I \"could have cancelled the order at any time\" and stopped responding to my calls/emails altogether asking for a refund or a discount. I called Projector People asking for a manager to call me back. No manager would talk to me and no one at Projector People attempted to call me. Instead, when I called in I was directed to voice mails that were never returned. Finally, I had to ask a poor secretary for a manager's email and put the manager on the month-long email thread with Sarah showing weeks without any response and multiple instances of Sarah telling me it has shipped when it hadn't. Only then did the manager acknowledge my request to return the unopened projector that came a month late and get a refund. 2 stars instead of 1 because once I did get approval for a refund, it was done quickly. In summary, Projector People sales reps and management was unresponsive and cowardly, hoping I would just give up and take a projector that should have come in 3-days in a month. It took many calls and emails to even get a refund for an unopened, returned projector. Small companies like this have to have good customer service. I could have gotten the projector for the same price on Amazon Prime with included 2-day shipping. Don't shop at Projector People, it is made up of people who don't care about customers."

However, the sales associates forgot they offered free 2 day shipping so unfortunately, we are going to have to wait a bit longer for our projector. Makes me wonder if they will remember the free lifetime support they say they offer too. Other than that, I would say the transaction was about what you would expect from an online retailer. Average."

Shipping was free ground and they shipped that day but it took 8 damn days to get to my house and luckily I was home as it shipped in the Epson box so anyone looking to potentially steal a package would have known exactly what they were grabbing! I'm just kind of upset as I didn't think about it until after I bought it that instead of waiting, I could have just ran to the store as I checked and they had 3 in stock. All I got from Projector People was an unnecessary wait. At least in the old days I'd have had the satisfaction of knowing I kept a few bucks out of the hands of the corrupt state politicians to fund their evil."

I tried ordering a projector lamp from them. Website claimed it ships in 1-2 days. Two weeks later, still no package, no shipping confirmation, no tracking, nothing. So I email their support. Three days later, still no response whatsoever. So I try calling their support number. Holding loop. 12 minutes in, it rings, someone picks up, and immediately hangs up without a word.

          "Contenu": "I purchased a Panasonic AE8000U during a recent sale. The offer included free 2-day shipping, and the price was excellent. I ordered on Friday and was assured that the projector would go out that day, and should arrive by Tuesday. I hadn't received a tracking number, so I called Monday to ask for one so that I could monitor the shipment and make sure I was home to sign for the projector. The person I spoke with said that the package was on it's way and projected for delivery on Friday. When I asked why it was taking so long, I was informed that the projector was shipped ground. It turns out that even though the salesperson marked the projector for 2-day shipment, the warehouse sent it ground. It's not a major problem, more of an inconvenience, but I would think that when the company advertises free 2-day shipping, they would let the warehouse know. Also, if I had actually paid extra for the 2-day shipping and it had been shipped ground, I would have been pretty angry, so I would expect the warehouse to do a better job of paying attention to shipping method. Overall, the great price far outweighs the inconvenience of the shipping error."

          "Contenu": "On my first try to order a Benq HT1075 through the website, it wouldn't process (take credit card info and finish order) on first 2 tries. I then tried another one of my other pc's and was successful. When you order from ProjectorPeople you have to coordinate all your business through an assigned agent. The projector did arrive even earlier than projected which was very nice but getting tracking info was slow and the projector actually showed up at my door before I was able to get the tracking info from my agent and from the tracking deliverer. The projector itself had a glaring hotspot issue in the bottom center of the projected image with other image uniformity issues of fading focus and brightness areas at the edges. It appears this is somewhat documented online as a known issue and may be resolved with a firmware update which may be performed by the brave adventurer with the proper software but could brick the unit and/or void the warranty, and to have it done by the factory techs would cost a substantial additional amount of money for the upgrade as well as the shipping and the down time without a projector...all of which is ridiculous, as the units should be upgraded to latest firmware for free. One of the primary reasons that I bought from ProjectorPeople in the first place was because of their so called \"No Hassle\" return policy, which is a little misleading. So, with these issues, I requested a RMA for a refund. If you can find the \"fine print\" before you buy, not super easy, you have to pay for your own shipping back to ProjectorPeople and if it has over 4hrs of use, have to pay a restocking fee. My projector's lamp runtime claimed that it had 10hrs or use which was impossible as I didn't even hook it up till 5pm that day and after trying some calibration to correct the image issues and sampling the beginning of a couple of movies, I shut the projector off before 9pm, boxed it back up to send it back, so it either had been previously used or tested somewhere or the lamp runtime counter also had a defect. My agent did agree to waive the restocking fee but to assure that the projector arrived back to them with the limited return window and requirement to be insured, it was like $80 to ship it back. As an important comparison, (external reference) provides free return shipping and labels and is truly \"No Hassle\" as I've had to send a different model projector back to them and never threatened with a restocking fee. Lastly, it took numerous inquires as to the status of my RMA transaction, which took longer than I was quoted it would take. While the prices were very competitive at ProjectorPeople, I found the return policy, slight ordering issues, etc to be enough that I probably won't use them again."

          "Contenu": "I have done a lot of business with ProjectorPeople in the past through personal purchases and referrals to my customers amounting to 10+ projectors over the past several years.  Having purchased a new home for myself, I am installing my own theater and ordered a projector and screen on the website.  The projector was shipped quickly and worked great, as I have always come to expect from my past experience with ProjectorPeople.  I got a call after the order was placed, thanking me for my business and providing contact numbers.  The screen however was not such a great experience.  After several days of not having seen a tracking number for the screen, I finally called PP.  My sales rep was not in the office so I spoke to another rep.  I asked about the tracking number and was told that the screen was coming on Pilot freight lines, which is why I wasn't seeing a tracking number.  He told me that the screen was scheduled to be delivered on a day last week where I was going to be out of town.  I asked him if they could reschedule delivery for today, June 9, so that I could be here to sign for it.  He put me on hold and came back on the line and told me that delivery was rescheduled for today.  Since nothing had come today, I called PP again and this time spoke to my rep.  He told me that the way it worked was that I had to call Pilot to schedule a delivery time.  When I explained my earlier conversation with his colleague he told me that they can't schedule the freight delivery on their end, it has to be done by me.  When I asked \"how was I supposed to know that?\".  He told me that I should have been contacted with the information.  I had received no email and no calls.  He gave me the number for Pilot and the tracking number (it actually does exist).  I called Pilot and was told, \"there is a note here that we weren't supposed to deliver until after June 9\" (evidently communication can happen from PP to the shipper, it was just not the correct communication).  He asked me if I would like to set up a delivery time.  I was transferred to the local facility and a very helpful Pilot rep set up my delivery for tomorrow (meanwhile I waited around all day today for a shipment that would have never come had I not called PP).  Here is where it gets even more frustrating.  About 5 minutes after I got off of the phone with Pilot, I got an automated phone call from Pilot telling me that I needed to call their facility to schedule a delivery time.  Someone was asleep on this one.  It almost seems like my call to PP today woke them up and they called the shipper to get the next phase of this $100 delivery going.\r I am a big fan of projectors and had three in my old home (sold with the house) and just installed the first of three in my new home.  I am a big fan of ProjectorPeople, as evidenced by my business with them.  I could have purchased this projector for less money from B&H Photo or other authorized dealer, but I went with PP because of my incredible satisfaction with their service in the past.  I feel like this time around they dropped the ball despite my efforts to help them keep it in play with my call a several days ago and the revelations today.  I am hoping that there are no more surprises with the screen.  I have to admit, that with my past experience with the excellent communication from PP and their knowledge of my issues with this delivery, I am surprised that PP hasn't at least called me to follow up to make sure I have been taken care of by Pilot.  I even told my rep, \"I'm going to be upset if I call Pilot and find out that delivery hasn't been scheduled for today\".  My phone remains silent.  With this experience, I'm not sure that I can forego saving $50+ on the projector and mount to maintain my loyalty to PP.  Disappointed...."

We managed to obtain an adapter to make the unit function, but the instruction sheet is still wrong. In general, it is good value for the money, but would have confused someone not an AV geek."

The shipping was strange - the shipping notification had two tracking numbers. Both belonged to the freebies that came well packed by FeDex with signature required. Whereas, the projector tracking was not in the notification (found it on their order page) was sent by ground shipping in its native-box with no additional packing and no signature required. All in all I would recommend as although the site said that projector purchases need to be verified by phone (which is always a hassle), it was shipped right away without any such verification."

The Fedex shipping tag described the projector being held in FL through Tuesday meaning earliest delivery was Wednesday.  So, for the extra $62 I got a 5 day delivery.  While not your fault, I spoke to an agent on Tuesday when the projector did not arrive and was told it should be here.  It was not here.  It arrived another day later.  Meanwhile, I had to cancel customers costing me additional loss of revenue.  Again, not your fault, but I would think you might be able to contest the delivery with Fedex on my behalf."

Too much time had elapsed for them to replace the screens again.  However, this is a simple fix:  Don't ever buy Da-Lite screens.  I try and purchase US-made products as often as I can.  I hope I can find a different domestic manufacturer.\r We bought another projector from The Projector People last week.  We are very pleased with the unit.  It works very well for our room and is plenty bright.  Carmen gave us a good recommendation."

I originally thought it was a bait-n-switch scam, since that's the way they work... but no, they really just wanted to upsell me and when I didn't bite, they shipped out what I ordered very quickly.\r Really, there's no valid reason to call somebody after an Internet order unless you are trying to squeeze more money out of your customer, somehow.  That's borderline sleezy these days.\r But other than that, my experience with Projector People was top-notch."

I am getting a 93\" movie image at 15' of throw.3) The speaker(s) \"sound\" appears to be directed behind the projector and is of less quality than most TVs.  To be fair, only a few will rely on built in sound.  It is capable of getting loud depending on the source volume."

But it was less expensive than the one the website suggested and did all the same stuff.

He had his installed by professionals so his help was a little limited as to set up etc. I was \"assigned\" a rep. and herein lies the \"but\" above. After ordering the projector, she could have contacted me and offered advice about 3D Blu-Ray players available and other accessories available. Instead, I had to research and go elsewhere to purchase my Samsung H-6500 Smart 3D Blu-Ray player and she could have queried my installation. My installation is in an enclosed housing which requires an IR extender accessory made by Panasonic. Even though the accessory is listed in the Panasonic instructions, I could not locate in in your web site. Instead, I had to order it from a different company. Even though the rep's help would have been unsolicited to some degree, it could have saved me some time and frustration in set up."

Shortly after I had buyer's remorse as I found out PP offered the same projector without sales tax and a $50 Visa gift card.  That was going to be a $90 savings that made it worth the while to shop at PP.  The shipping time was from PP was over a week, but I wasn't in a hurry.  My only disappointment with the whole experience with PP was the projector was not shipped in a secondary box like Amazon did.  Not only does this offer more protection for a expensive piece of electronics but it prevents prying eyes from seeing what I ordered.  The package was delivered by FedEX and was left on my doorstep, no signature required as I was led to believe.  My wife postponed running errands on the delivery day specifically to sign for the package, that didn't require it.  Overall I would order from PP again if they continued to offer the best price and provided more security in shipping their products.  Thanks"

The information and price offered by the Projector People was second to none. The communication and shipping were great. My projector connected and was perfect in less than 10 minutes after I opened it. My only negative experience was my unavoidable concern that I wouldn't be able to return the projector if there was a small problem or it didn't fit my needs right. I was told by the company that if there were any problems I would have a very short window of return and a long process of them trying to fix any problems I may have rather than refunding me. I understand it's a business and refunds mean lost money, but I am still very concerned that if a problem arises that can't be hashed out over a phone call I will be out of luck. There have been no problems thus far though and I am happy with the quality I have received from this company."

Their site showed the item as \"In stock - ships within 24 hours\". 3 days later, still no shipment ackowledgement. I emailed their customer service and got \"I'm sorry, the product is not in stock due to high demand, but we placed the order with Epson to have shipped direct to you and you should have within a week\". Week and a half later, still nothing. Check ProjectorPeople.com website and it shows \"In stock - ships within 24 hours\". I email asking if mine has shipped? Response \"We received in about 5 units last week but Epson was supposed to ship yours direct to you. Epson didn't ship your order yet. They are telling me now Mid-November.\".\r -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r The same day of posting the above, I was contacted and assured the projector would be overnighted and delivered the following day. It is the following day, and the projector did arrive as promised."

Finding someone knowledgeable to help me navigate to making the 'right' purchase was what I was striving for and my 1st phone call to this company was all I needed to tell me I had made the right decision. My sales associate Rich simply the best! A great listener, very informative...very friendly and was able to put me in the right direction to exactly what I needed. I ended up purchasing an Epson 3800. While there were a couple models a step up from that which were recommended, due to the size of those units and the limitations of my placement, the 3800 was the ideal choice and wow....what a difference from the budget projector I had been using for the past 6 months. That Epson may end up being one of the best upgrades I've ever made! After I finished ceiling mounting it...I called Rich with a follow up comment about how great the picture looked and he was even able to provide valuable info which helped me tweak the machine to meet a specific ratio issue I was having getting it to fit my screen. I love that the company provides lifetime customer support....even though I could go to Epson directly. Courteous and knowledgeable customer support from a reliable company! what more can you ask for!!! I highly recommend finding reviewers of the 3800 on YouTube to get additional pointers on best calibration. You'll want to play around a little with settings to suit your environment, but once you lock in your settings you'll be thrilled with how it delivers!!!"
