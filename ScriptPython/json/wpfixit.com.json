          "Contenu": "I posted a review 2 days ago, after I was dissatisfied with the service. In essence, I was hoping I could fix a WP issue without STFP credentials. I paid for the service but was told it couldn't be done without it. I asked for a refund and I was offered 100% credit or 50% cash. I was unhappy, so I posted a review that reflected my negative experience. After that, I received over 10 emails threatening my website and business. The senders were both an employee and a manager. My WP credentials were also used by someone to take my website down (i can see activity under my name when I wasn't online).  Here are a few examples of the emails I received:\"You have five minutes to remove your Google review or I will destroy your business online and let everybody know how you do business with others. I can play the same game with your company. Report back when the review is removed and I will stop all actions.\"\"OK!!!Get ready for the pain!!I will spend all day leaving bad reviews for your company.It can all stop as soon as you remove yours.\"\"Here is another and there will be 100s more.  You are wrong and the time I spent here IS NOT free.\"\"OK.  You will get the SAME treatment.Our refund policy was clear and you agreed to it when you made a purchase. I spent an hour here and that time is not free!!!!\u200bI have a massive agenda to kick in tons of negative SEO against your website over the next six months.It could all end as soon as you remove your review.\"I do not recommend dealing with WP fix it."

          "Contenu": "There are no words to describe how awful this \"company\" is. They bully, they threaten retaliation, and we've got the emails to prove it. Their customer service is by the far worst of any online company we've ever worked with.The owner is probably going to post a reply to this review saying that we're not customers, that they have hundreds of five star reviews, etc. etc. etc. Or they'll cut and paste their usual reply to negative reviews. Yes, they have lots of positive reviews, and maybe some of them are actually real. But why is the second highest percentage of reviews so incredibly negative? Do yourself a favor and read all the negative reviews and look for the patterns. Then ask yourself why so many people say the same things?There are many services who can fix wordpress problems for about the same price without the headaches and complete lack of professionalism.###UPDATED: Read their reply. No apology, just assumptions and accusations. We're not tarnishing their reputation, we're telling the truth. They do a perfectly fine job of tarnishing their own reputation.As for details, our experience was the same as virtually every other negative reviewer. When you raise legitimate concerns, they reply with insults and threats.And this isn't a fake account, it's a new account we created for TrustPilot. As we said before, just read their one and two star reviews and do your homework. Do you see this many people saying the same things about other companies?###UPDATED: Good, legitimate companies always apologize first for misunderstandings or miscommunication and trust their customers. The customer is always right. Well, that is unless you're working with WPFixit.Again, just read the reviews, their business model is to over-promise, under-deliver, and then harass and bully and threaten. Also, we never said \"the majority of reviews\" \u2014 as any literate reader can see by reading our review. We simply asked why the #2 most popular category is 1 star.Potential customers: Please just take the time and read their negative reviews. It's not hard to see how these guys operate.And as for all the five-star reviews, maybe ask yourself if they're using one of the many services where you can buy paid reviews. They're easy to find.###UPDATED: Once again, wrong. They keep repeating lies in hopes their potential customers cannot read. We have not said \"the majority of people are unhappy\" \u2014 that's them twisting words, as they have done with so many clients.But why is there such a clear pattern in their 1 star extremely negative reviews?We are happy to provide additional information privately to potential customers of this small business. But we will not reveal ourselves here so that WPFixIt can blackmail us by posting fake negative reviews about our own company, even though they've never been our customers. (thankfully) Yes, sadly you can buy fake reviews for site and others. Just Google it, we did and found several options.And finally, potential customers who might be reading this review, don't you think it's interesting that he said our review and account were fake, but then wrote this?\"These reviews are all fully verified and real because that is the power behind TrustPilot. You cannot provide fake reviews.\"Exactly. And our review is not fake."

It is a huge sham that I advise you to avoid at all costs. Hire a freelancer who can cost you even less on fiverr.com, toptal.com or freelancer.com, ... and make a good job."

If you read other responses to bad reviews you can see how they go after the reviewer. And they seem to have no problem completely making things up. I didn't ask for a refund, I just decided not to work with them again. And I certainly was never vulgar with them.  Only because I had given a previous review I wanted to update my response to warn others.  I seriously can't believe their response. If you read through their responses to negative reviews you can see clearly how they turn to slander in attempt to get people to take their reviews down.

This is just what a professional service looks like to me.Jan 30, 2019 (I was just notified that WP Fix IT have now edited their reply and offered to correct the situation ... 1.5 years after my initial review). I think I will leave my review as is. A year and a half later, my site has long since been fixed but NOT by WP Fix IT. Perhaps they have since improved their customer service. I hope so."

They broke my website and didn't even perform the service I paid for - and then they all-caps email shouted at me when I complained.I hired them to do a site speed up service. At first, all seemed well. They sent me screenshots that seemed to indicate the site was going faster. Great.Two days later, I noticed that ever since they updated my site, my Google traffic had disappeared. When I contacted them about the issue, they claimed there was no way it could have been a problem they created, even though it happened on the day of the service.I spent hours of my own time figuring out that they'd somehow broken my analytics code. My code is tied to my advertising network, which means I lost income during the 2.5 days between their service and my fix, in addition to the time and frustration of spending hours fixing what they broke and being talked down to when I suggested that they were the ones who broke it.Finally, irony of ironies, I checked my site speed via Google's speed checker and...it's the same speed it was before they got in there. So not only did they break my site and cost me time and money, but they didn't even speed up my site! I reached out to customer service to try and get a refund and they didn't seem to even read my emails. They just kept sending irritable responses telling me I had to deal directly with the person who'd broken my site (who had already been testy with me and who I never wanted to deal with again).Absolutely do not use their service if you value your website. This company does not give a crap about your site or you as a person and if something does go wrong, their customer service will just yell at you about it."

I started with the basic plan as I had read all the services and it seemed to fit. I was promptly advised to pay for a more expensive service, which I did. The agent was really very rude, but I figured he might be having a hard day or something and carried on with the services. Next he asked for my hosting credentials which seemed a little off. I gave it to him trusting the reviews I read were spot on. Next he informs me that my hosting company is \"the worst\" and that I should change it to another one where I, no surprise, I get a great deal if I use their coupon code. NO THANK YOU. I call my hosting and do what he told me to do, and next thing you know, I have a security warning screen and my site is TOTALLY GONE. He, again with a lot of attitude, informs me that this is my fault and he can't do anything until it is back online. But I had literally only done what he asked. Next, I find out that my IP address had been changed, WEIRD. I am now on my 4th call to my host trying to undo what he has done and when I asked for a refund, I was told I could have 50% back of the more expensive plan that they sold me to no fix my issue. DO NOT ENGAGE THIS COMPANY.EDIT POST REPLY:It appears that this company also bullies after being reviewed poorly. I run a tiny internet shop that is focused on being a good person and putting out good vibes. Reviewing our interaction, there really is no reason for him to continue to come after me. The profanity he refers to is the following comment \"Is there anyway we can talk on the phone? I for some reason have given you the impression that I am an a**hole, but I am totally not. I am just worried about how long my shop has been down\". The worst part is that after I honestly answered a survey on the site that my experiece was \"Not Good\" he replied to my ticket  \"Game On!!!\". I feel scared for the integrity of my online business, is that really a company you want to ask to help?"

This seems to be one of these companies that have shiny marketing (even the owner sends you personalised videos) but once you purchase it's chaotic and simply rude. I spent $147 to get my website speed improved. After the purchase, you get an email asking you to supply your WordPress login data (I made another admin account for them). I submitted this right away via a simple web form.You then get a series of emails explaining how 'easy peasy' everything is. I was able to log into my account and download my invoice. The account overview looks decent.The 'ticket' section, however, didn't allow me to log in (password not matching). There is no password recovery option. I sent a manual email to reset. A representative rudely replied \"I sent you an email about 3 hours ago and you did not follow what it says.  You will not have an account created until you do this.\" I tried to explain to him that I DID have an account - how could I have otherwise downloaded my invoice? I even attached screenshots.It went back and forth a few times until he wrote \"You will not see any tickets because you have not created a ticket yet. You have to follow the instructions in the email that was sent to you twice in order to create a ticket and create an account.\"I have no idea which email he refers to.It's still a mystery to me why I have to create any ticket at all when I have bought a simple service. Why can you not just deliver what I've paid for?Anyways, after maybe 10 emails I've had enough of his incompetence and unwillingness to help. No work had yet be done so I requested a refund. I was sent a link to their 'refund policy' and guess what... it asked me for a ticket number! So I went back to the very first email and did the whole process again and somehow managed to create a ticket number. After supplying the ticket number I was given two options: 50% money back, or a voucher.This is totally unacceptable. You are keeping your customers trapped. Every decent company is transparent from the start about how to stop a service and request a refund.Shortly after I received an email that my login details have been changed to an email that is not my own anymore. (xxxx AT yyyy.dispute) . Now I am locked out.I reached out to PayPal to escalate the issue there. In the reply of WP FIX IT I was threatened with legal action \"This request is fraudulent and further pursuit will result in legal action.\"Now I am locked out of the account, I cannot reset any password and I'm being threatened on PayPal.WP FIX IT will probably refer to their small print in the T&C's when replying to this message. I can only say that I am utterly disappointed how a company that seemed so capable on the outside turned out to be the exact opposite after they have taken my money. I will continue trying to get my money back and will update this review when I know more."

          "Contenu": "I recently had a horrendous (and frankly, quite unbelievable) experience with WP Fixit.  Unfortunately I found my assigned agent to be rude, pushy and not the slightest bit interested in providing customer \u2018care\u2019. I tried to explain 5 times what I needed done (as evidenced by the transcript), but this agent refused to respond to my request. Instead, he made a \u2018fix\u2019 that I did NOT request and ultimately left my site in a worse condition than it was prior to his supposed help. I've since had to hire another developer at a cost of over US$200 to fix the damage.As soon as it became obvious that the agent\u2019s work was causing more issues on the site and that he was not taking time to understand my actual problem, I asked him to stop working and to please provide me with documentation on what he had done, so that I could hopefully remedy the worsening situation. At this point the agent quickly closed the ticket so that I could no longer communicate with him. He failed to provide me with any explanation or any documentation. And I could no longer access my site. After contacting my hosting provider, it turns out that this agent had deliberately inserted some code into the .htaccess in the root directory to cause a 500 Internal Server error.  My host had to remove this code to allow me to access my site again.  At first I couldn't believe that the agent would have sabotaged my site out of spite, but after reading reviews about him on another site, I absolutely believe that he did.  What\u2019s more, when I contacted \u2018support\u2019 to make a complaint and ask for a refund, the attitude was similarly rude and nasty. Despite a courteous, detailed email from me explaining the situation and offering evidence to back my position, \u2018support\u2019 was clearly not interested and fobbed me off in two short sentences. The email wasn\u2019t even signed \u2013 just a rude, anonymous message that I wouldn\u2019t be getting a refund.When I asked for the name of a superior who could help, the reply was just \u2018I am the boss. No-one higher.\u201dI have used this company in the past and had excellent service from other agents. I was shocked and distressed by this recent interaction and won\u2019t be using the service again. I still don\u2019t have a refund, despite the damage that was done to my site and additional cost of getting it rectified.I have tried to contact the owner to report this agent's criminal behaviour but haven't had any luck as yet.IN RESPONSE TO WPFIXIT'S REPLY BELOW:  Unfortunately it appears you've confused me with another customer.  Contrary to what you say below, I have only ever been decent and polite in my communications.  I have also never asked or expected any work to be done for free.  Nor have I EVER been given a refund or asked not to use the service again.  I have seen the exact same response given to another customer on another review site so suspect that you have me confused with them."

          "Contenu": "I purchased the speed up service a week ago. Before work commenced, I stated that this was a multisite, and that we had a special setup involving redirect code, and that any time of caching (historically) would break that code. After work was completed, our site was completely broken. We were told the site was faster, but users are getting random 404 errors on pages that definitely exist, getting random 502 timeout errors, https:// urls are redirecting to http:// and giving insecure content warnings, and worst of all - none of the sub sites within the multisite are accessible at all, not front end nor in the admin dashboard. The service technician refuses to fix the problem, and continually blames our web host (WP Engine), saying our server must have \"infections\", and that it's not his fault or his problem. When I asked for a refund he refused. When I asked to be placed into contact with a supervisor, he said he was the supervisor. When I asked to be put into contact with the manager, he said he was the manager. When I asked to be put into contact with the owner, he refused. Now we are forced to restore our site to a backup from a week ago, which means we lose content and woocommerce order data, which costs us even more time and money. This is absolutely ridiculous, and certainly the worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life.IN RESPONSE TO WP FIXIT'S REPLY:Every time I described the issue, the agent alternately kept saying \"this is not our issue - your server is full of infections, this is not my fault\", then would turn around and say please describe your problem so I can look at it\". After a week of this I am done. The site is broken as a direct result of what the technician did. No other work was done during this time. He has stated he cannot fix it. He has refused to issue a refund. He refused to put me in contact with anyone of higher authority to discuss the issue. There is absolutely nothing inaccurate about anything I said, and I am happy to share the full ticket transcript with anyone who would like to see it.Direct quotes from the service agent on the ticket - \"That issue has nothing at all to do with the work I completed.\" - \"Please ask your host. None of my actions are related to your issues now. Ask your host. They are are a very difficult host to run a site on. So many limitations. \" - \"I am sorry but even if I reverse all that was completed and put in a default .htaccess file, multisite still does not work. There are also some infections in your account. You will need to work with host to correct.\" - \"I spent 3 hours on your site this morning and no matter what multi site will not work. You have bigger issues. You also have infections on the server.\" - \"You can even turn off every single plugin on the site and multi-site still will not work.\" - \"Refund is not happening. I have spent about 7 hours on this ticket and sped it up and provided proof of that. Have the host scan account for infections and you will see. I am simply reporting what I see and what I know. I do this all day every day for 10 years now.\" - \"Not happening. More than happy to help fix what you see broken and I have reported to you that site is infected and multi site issues have nothing to do with my work. Why don't you restore site to before work and we can go from there with starting over. That will still not remvoe infectiosn though.\"....and on and on and on....The fact remains that the site worked just fine (slow - but working fine) before you did any work - now it is completely broken. I gave the technician examples of what was broken several times, and kept getting the same answers over and over. So please don't put the blame on me for not accepting help.IN RESPONSE TO WP FIXIT'S 2ND RESPONSE:Wow...very professional.  Write a bad review of WP Fixit, share the details of the service ticket to back up your review, and get your company bad mouthed.  No, \"we're sorry you had a bad experience, let's find another way to help you\", no \"we did what we could, if you are not satisfied we'll stand by our policy and issue a refund\".  Just a total flat out denial, lying about our refusal to tell them the problem when I did several times, and a public sharing of our private customer details.  Then they have the temerity to tell people not to purchase products from our site.  Again - anyone who would like a copy of the complete and whole transcript of the service ticket so you can judge for yourself, I am happy to share it!   Good luck to you all!"

By blindly optimizing our WP site, they configured the plugin of *their* choice incorrectly for the site's needs and it literally cratered the site, putting us out of business for an extended time period. Further, they took NO responsibility for their lack or preparation or the consequences. Zero. It resulted in nearly $2000 in repair work that was essentially a rebuild. Very small, inconsequential issues is what they can fix, but DO NOT entrust them with anything more than that."

Their customer service only routed me back to my ticket, so I could not reach a human on the phone or via their chat function. They then blocked my IP address from their site. They blackmailed me and I have the screenshots to prove it (I would upload if TrustPilot offered that option). Jay, the customer associate from from WPFixIt.com blackmailed me and provided threats. Subsequent email I received: \"I am going to make it my life mission letting others online know about how you operate and to stay far far away from your business.  I was very nice and response to you here fixing your issue FAST and explained that the error message you see is a general message for 1000s of different issues.  This is what WordPress displays when there is an issue.  DOES NOT mean it is the same issue every time. Those 18 years of SEO experience will really come in handy.\" STAY FAR AWAY FROM WPFixIt.com Do not use WPFixit.com.I submitted a complaint with the BBB and also consulted a lawyer, as blackmail is a considered extortion and a crime. Since I am a professional writer with work in national publications, I will be covering this situation in the media as a cautionary tale to other business owners."

Enthusiastic I took the 3-month subscription and it comes out there and I can't do this and I can't do this one, in the end maybe they just upload some text and some images for you .. so canceled. Then I take the package to speed up the site again and here the impossible occurs ... I was in an area with little network coverage and I could not immediately see the result on the site side but the metrics they had reported were excellent GTm double A then I go to verify in practice the css do not load, it results page without background and text at random, on the PC you need to scroll the page and at that point it loads but on the mobile phone a blank page appears. In these 8 days that the work has finished, I contact the chat, send the ticket etc but they do not answer me only today they ask me that I have to repay ... repay what you did wrong. In the meantime, however, after not having received a response from them, I also tried to do all the plugin updates to see if it resolved but nothing. I have an e-commerce that does not load for 8 days get a little idea of \u200b\u200bthe damage I am suffering.2 stars and I don't put 1 because the first few times they worked well but this last thing is destroying me for old customers, it's an eleraning platform so they can't study, and for new ones who don't see the site well.UPDATATE AFTER YOUR REPLYYou are lousy you have made it clear my website and the admin user and password of my site in the pdf linked here on this page.UPDATE AND AFTER JUST 2 MINWP Fix It (Changing Lives) ha scritto una nuova recensione a 1 stella di Fiorerosalba:The owner of this website hired up to do some work and it was completed exactly as described and then they when and disputed the charge to get their money back after the work was completed. Stay far away from this company.Is this serious business behavior? What should I expect you to hack me and destroy the site now?UPDATE 8:26 pm (Italy time)And even on the corporate Facebook of FioreRosalba.com Mr. Jarrett Gucci owner of wpfix went to put his negative review\"Horrible Communication and Reputation Shaming...The owner of this website my company to do some work and it was completed exactly as described and then they when and disputed the charge to get their money back after the work was completed.See full details of the entire service communication at url (of pdf whit admin user and passwod that he shared before)Stay far away from this company.\" Forgetting that the \u20ac 598 I paid him in 2020 for various jobs I opened the dispute only for the last \u20ac 77. Instead of going to look at the site it is filling the internet with negative reviews. This is bully behavior."

(Seriously, we were on the phone with them for HOURS and repeatedly getting disconnected...) I paid for WP Fix It's speed optimization fix. They also couldn't fix the issue, but my understanding was that godaddy needed to fix something on their end and really no one outside of godaddy could fix it. And godaddy support is just awful. So, based on their recommendation, I simply signed up with WP Fix It to host our site. They had the site ported over to their servers AND had the problem fixed within an hour. It's really expensive hosting for what little we have/need, but for them to have fixed our problem and be able to do so for no extra charge in the future may be perfect for us. Everyone that helped us was incredibly responsive (on a Sunday no less), friendly, and capable. I knocked off a star for having paid for the initial service that didn't fix our problem (although it seems like they spent a fair amount of time on it, and ultimately I don't think any third party could have fixed it) and their hosting is pricy. Again, it may very well be completely worth it. I'll update this review after we've used them for a bit."

There were a number of hours before my ticket was allocated to someone.After the fix I had an email with \"Thank you so much for submitting your feedback. We really appreciate it and use this info to keep making us better.\". I don't believe I submitted feedback. The feedback that I \"submitted\" was \"Awesome\". So I'm annoyed that WP Fix It appear to award themselves \"Awesome\" on what could be an automatic or default basis.On a second support case, this went through much more quickly with Kumar. Again good communication occurred. I'm testing the fix at the moment. I'm happier on this second experience and would use WP Fix It again I think."

In the course of the fix, I found out about their WooCommerce monthly subscription package, which for the price they are asking, is an absolute steal! I will be subscribing the store they fixed, as well as any other Woo stores I manage for my clients, to this service with WP Fix It. It definitely takes a load off this busy website designer, so I can get other things that I am more skilled at done. Bravo!!!"

Since starting hosting a month ago, we found another tricky problem with our site and Landen at WPFixit spent hours helping us dig into it, and eventually found a solution - He was tenacious and spent a lot of time with us, even though I thought we weren't going to be able to fix it and would just have to live with it.

          "Contenu": "This review is about their hosting service! Over the past year or so the various WP Fix It support members who have helped me fix client sites have mentioned their hosting services. Admittedly I was really wary about making the change. Price was a big factor but also the idea of trying to convince several hundred clients to make the move AND having their website hosting in one place and their domain with another.Cher with WP Fix It reached out to me and answered every question I threw at her until I couldn't come up with a reason not to make the move. She was that thorough and understanding in making sure I had all the information I needed before I made the leap of faith. So with nothing left to ask and only money to lose I made the leap on March 1st. I knew to sell my clients on the idea of making this move I needed examples and WP Fix It server setup support free of charge (included in initial setup) migrated all the sites that I was hosting myself (about 14). The speed in which it was completed was amazing and the performance improvements of the websites amazed me as well! I knew I could start selling my clients on the idea.In 16 short days I've convinced about 2 dozen more to make the move with a lot more to go. But every step along the way WP Fix It has answered every support ticket I've submitted and fixed every issue that has come up. I can say that WP Fix It is the leader in WordPress hosting and support."
