These thieves tricked me into purchasing a year's worth of their service by listing the MONTHLY price on the payment page and only listing that I will be paying the full year's worth of service in small text down below.  Any company that needs to hide their terms like that are thieves and untrustworthy.  Do not trust this company!  I got a refund but I should not have to ask for a refund!  The sign up process should be clear and plain as day if you have a product that is worth buying!"

Even Google just charge 1 $ and refund after several hours, it is just a way for google to check the payment is working or not. Free trial is free, no reason to take 1 month billing like this Newshosting, and when I want to shut down my account, I must tell their supporter how to refund my free trial charge, they tell me must wait after 2 week(or 1 month I dont remembered exactly), funny than ever.

This process has crashed my computer more times than I can count.  Not only this, but if i cue multiple binaries, the files for each successive download are delayed in propagating until all files in the cue are downloaded and are sent through whatever processor-intensive process they must pass.It used to be that downloaded files appeared almost as soon as the download was finished.  Now, if I am downloading more than 100MB at a time, I can expect huge delays, possibly the lockup or crashing of my computer, and possibly the loss of the files that caused the processing logjam in the first place.I adore the search feature, the completion levels, and most of the features of the application, but now, if I want to download binaries without crashes, I have to go a little bit at a time.Also, as a Mac user, it's unfortunate that Newshosting is again neglecting us by failing to explicitly stating whether or not the news reading app is compatible with the latest OS or the new M1 chip Macs.  The last time I upgraded my OS, the news reader was not updated for a few months.  I was lucky enough to have another computer which I did not upgrade, but it was a hassle to figure out why Newshosting's app did not work."

The search function is not discriminating enough. It has 'way too wide match parameters for content--one constantly gets overwhelming numbers of results, most of which have absolutely nothing to do with specific content searched for. The browser app also does a very poor job of deciphering the current content obfuscation methods in use in most Usenet forums, so oftentimes the results are difficult to understand.  Also, there needs to be some way to in your browser download function to Shift-select a whole chunk of radio-boxes en-mass, rather than having to laboriously select each box individually (the lack of that function alone is a real pain.)"

For example if I type in a search for Mash Season One I'll get ALL of the Mash episodes along with a bunch of stuff that doesn't have anything to do with MASH.  I'd like to get results, then re-filter those results. I'd also like better customization. Every time I use it I have to go in an resize the date cell so I can see all of it. I'd really like there to be a workspace that I could set up and have that every time.I'd like there to be a much better user manual for the software. It could be in the form of a YouTube video but I'd like to get an explanation for how each part of the Newshosting app works. I suspect that I'm only using a small percentage of Newshosting's capabilities simply because I don't know that certain features are there."

Also the lag time of when I can get items from using other newsreaders appears to be about 12 hours ahead of Newshosting.  I love the format of Newshosting, but it does lag behind other more developed news readers. Please include the ability to request uploads as another feature."

If I can ever shake my old VPN, I will use the one offered by Newshosting.In the past, I was disappointed with customer support not getting back with me.

          "Contenu": "Their core service of providing a 24/7 Usenet is feed is absolutely excellent.  I've been with them for many many years and I can't even remember when their service has ever been down.  It has good coverage too.My only gripe is the Windows application they provide. It's functionality is very basic and the search function in particular is very poor compared to, say, Newsbin.  Development of this app is almost non existent and when they do actually provide an update it usually breaks the app. This is currently the case. Rather than fix it, the support team simply inform me to downgrade the app to an old version. This has happened to me twice and if you try and get further information from support, they simply ignore you.I'd actually like to offer a 4.5 star review but it's either  4 or 5.In summary, a brilliant usenet service let down my a poor app."
