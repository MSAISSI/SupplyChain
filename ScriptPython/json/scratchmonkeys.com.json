          "Contenu": "I have tried so many times to buy from their site, and every single one my orders ends up being canceled even though I'm receiving an order receipt on my email just fine. The reason for that is that their site detects an unusual activity on my end. What's unusual thought, that I don't know. I also sent an email to their support to help me on what to do but it's been weeks and I have not received any response since.A total waste of time.Edit: just spoke with them on chat. They weren't helpful at all. Said that it's because of a 3rd party security that they are using and there's nothing they can do on their end to help me. Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if all this is just a scheme to steal my card info. Lemme cancel the ones I used ASAP."

Same issue, and it shows that my cart is still filled. Next morning, I see I got charged for the digital codes on my credit card even though I NEVER GOT PAST CHECK OUT OR RECEIVED THE CODES. THE ITEM IS STILL IN MY CART SO I DO NOT KNOW HOW THE TRANSACTION EVEN WENT THROUGH. Bank even called me because it was deemed suspicious activity. I will be buying my game cards elsewhere from now on due to my bad experience with this site."

My account says otherwise, but I have no way of contacting them to see how the card is supposed to be delivered! Very disappointing experience. Maybe a rip off.UPDATE: I received an update that noted this may have been marked for fraud by this vendor. I was not using a VPN, and all my information was correct, so I'm not sure how this happened. The card indicates the funds were removed, but the vendor indicates it may be in Pending status, meaning it's not in my account, not paid out, just inaccessible. I will contact the card company, but while that may return my funds, it does not get me any closer to the purchase. It's only $10, but because it's only $10, it shouldn't be this fraught to get it to work."

          "Contenu": "Overall, a good experience; purchase was legitimate and code worked. Unfortunately, due to fraud concerns, my original order had to be modified from three items to one, and the promo for new members was wasted. Also, a minor discrepancy with order total (price for original order came to approx. $85 CAD, but showed as approx. $90 CAD on Paypal), which isn't exactly proper. I had concerns that I wouldn't get customer service on the weekend, and was surprised to see a reply back within an hour. After a couple days going back and forth, finally got a replacement coupon, but three codes at a time was still flagged (did order a single code again, and no troubles redeeming)! Will attempt to do two, but doesn't look promising that more than one code at a time will ever be permitted."
