Said will investigate why the video was just white and never got back with answers. Super 8 film was old but kept in a dry and dark place. I believe this was a film development error. Just go somewhere else. And I can answer their reply even before this review gets one:Sure, I can remove this review for a small fee of 200$ and 20$ for audio that you will not receive plus 30$ for flash drive that you also will not receive. I might also come up with some more fees if you want me to remove this review faster. Sorry I actually can't remove it but I can overexpose it for a small fee. Sounds familiar?"

However while their service is friendly and cheerful, it leaves a bit to be desired in other ways.  EG, I was handed a box of archival DVD's in flimsy sheets with no sort of box the right size to store them so they don't wobble and also stay upright, and when I asked for advice on how to find the right-size container I got a shrug.  Also, they take the materials and don;t give you a receipt or even an accurate quote- that cones by email later.  In my case it was double what I was originally quoted because that quote did not include an extra charge for retrieving the audio tapes from dropbox, or a fee for paying by credit card.  So if one balks at the actual quote one has to make an additional trip to Greenpoint after work (they have no weekend hours) to retrieve the materials, all for nothing."

However, I wasn\u2019t notified of that and also paid to have the tape shipped back to me. They did refund me that shipping cost, but I paid a lot of money for what turned out to be a blank tape. They could have told me the tape was blank instead of sending a blank file to me for no apparent reason, which I then wasted days trying to listen to files that weren\u2019t there. It was my mistake to send a blank tape, I take the blame for that, but disappointed the communication was so poor."

I easily did my own split on the longer .wavs that were done right, so I can mix them as properly as possible - each song has a different set of mic placements, so the stere tracks were a waste, and I paid for them. Otherwise, great transfers. After the fact DiJiFi offered to do the individual song splits, but they are already done. We all did extra work, so this seems all fair."

Deducted one star because of the confusion and lack of response to my question regarding the differences in transferring VHS over to DVD or Blu Ray. When I dropped my VHS off I was told the technician who could answer my question specifically was not available but he would contact me regarding my question about Blu Ray quality compared to DVD for a VHS transfer and the cost difference. A week went by without a response and I emailed them. The reply I received back was the same as when I dropped the VHS off...the technician was not around but I would receive a response shortly. Not long thereafter I was notified the VHS transfer was completed and done on DVD. I was very happy with the final product and the quality was good for a 33 year old VHS source. I just didn't understand why I couldn't get a straight answer to a simple question and why they went ahead and completed the transfer without answering me first...I was willing to spend more on the Blu Ray if in fact it would have been a noticeable difference in quality. Not a big deal, like I said I would use them again."

          "Contenu": "This company was just great. Talk about above and beyond! I sent them a precious audio tape from 1971. Or I thought I did and that's where the trouble started. Jim had been in touch with me from my first contact, and when the tape did not arrive, he leaped into detective mode. He didn't give up, finally discovering that I had interchanged two digits and sent it to the wrong address. He visited that building multiple times trying to track the tape down but he had no luck. We both finally gave up. That was in March '22. In December, someone called me and told me the package had been left outside her door and she brought it inside. I told Jim and he called her and arranged to pick up the tape. He did that, and within a matter of days, an excellent digital version of my precious tape arrived. DiJiFi was far more patient than they needed to be since the whole mess was my fault. All that and a great job, too! I highly recommend them."
