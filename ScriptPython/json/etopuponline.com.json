For example, it seems RBC in T&T charges $50 TTD for using their debit cards because they consider the transaction an international purchase. This means if you purchase a top up of $50 TTD, your bank statement will reflect $100 TTD. Basically, you could have gotten 2 top ups if purchased offline.Check in with your respective banks to ensure their bank charges aren't the same cost as the top up amount or more, it may be cheaper to purchase offline for some.Update: Upon review of other T&T nationals ratings on Trustpilot, it seems that eTopUponline and Bmobile have ignored the concerns and are well aware of the $50 TTD that debit card holders (RBC) are having to pay for some time now and yet still chose not to disclose to customers that though you pay in TTD some banks view it as USD transaction and charge accordingly. Keep the customers in the know, please, its only courtesy. It's quite simple, let customer's know what they are getting into and they won't feel bamboozled."

It was only after I contacted a Bmobile Rep in Trinidad I was told that I had to take my Iphone to one of your Bmobile outlets before I left Trinidad to have something done to the SIM card before I could use it to make roaming calls in Guyana. Why wasn\u2019t this information posted on your online Bmobile web page where I purchase the online package. I spent approx $178.00 for a package that I can\u2019t use because I am in Guyana for the next couple of weeks and by the time I return to Trinidad for whatever adjustment to done to my SIM card, the package will be expired and I would have lost my $178.00 that I paid for the package. It\u2019s unfair to me and I think that I should be give some kind of credit to my account for not being provided with the relevant information when I was purchasing the package online.***Thank you bmobile for the quick reply I received to my review."

If the service they sold was not received, take it up with the  mobile operator... it's not their problem.This occurred on multiple occasions with multiple transactions. I am a very unsatisfied customer.Updated on 2023-04-24:I received an email from eTopUpOnline today claiming they resolved the problem, but they did NOT.In fact, they did absolutely nothing, except to repeat the same thing as they have on previous occurrences:  that the transaction was processed.The transactions were indeed processed, but NOT for the services purchased. This was made PERFECTLY CLEAR in my original complaint.In both cases I purchased Natcom 15-day Internet plans for 2 mobile numbers. But the those numbers did NOT receive the purchased services. Instead they received a much lower credit value for minutes only... no Internet... and worth only a fraction of the purchased value.If I could rate eTopUpOnline lower than one star, I would. Absolutely terrible value, terrible to do business with, terrible customer service."
