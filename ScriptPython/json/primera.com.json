          "Contenu": "I am a small business owner who has pretty much felt like he has flushed $3000 down the toilet with my purchase of the LX3000 by Primera. The first few months had all sorts of alignment issues. I finally worked those out and used them sparingly for a year. Maybe 1000 print jobs or less. Now I can't complete a project I need for my little coffee shop cause the prints are coming out of color cause the Printer Head dye cartridge is broken. Tried doing their ghetto procedure of taking out and dabbing it on wet paper towel. Worked for a total of two prints, and then a problem arose again. I should sue Primera in small claims court. These people are Shysters selling a product that is God Awful. I am wasting all the paper and ink printing it with the broken print head and won't get my needed project done before the Holidays. Shame on you Shysters. Watch the video I am posting on YouTube. Search for LX3000 Primera nightmare."

The new printer should have been sent from Primera to us overnight since we rely on the printer to print the labels to sell our products, but it was sent ground which caused many more days of delay in our business productivity."

I've spent hours of my life trying to get this hunk of junk to work consistently. It's caused so much stress, like it knows when we have a deadline. - The printer had to be sent back when we first got it, problem with the printhead.- It has trouble reading the ink cartridges- It got very clogged another time (but we were told to leave it on if not using it often so it cleans itself periodically, noted) I gave them one star because their tech support is actually quite good and responsive, maybe they get a lot of practice. It's possible I got a lemon, I know someone who raves about Primera printers. They would not refund my money or send a new one."

          "Contenu": "We purchased the LX2000 a  couple years back. As soon as it arrived we had issues with the machines reliability, consistency and just over all user experience, which was extremely subpar to other sticker and label machines we have ran and operated. We tried to get refunded, but they insisted it was our machine, so we sent it in and received a new one just to find the same cumbersome issues. We tried to get a refund but they insisted it was too late by that time (conveniently for them right?)  We then  sporadically used the LX2000, even with its time consuming printing setup process (print a test, adjust, print a test, adjust, etc). This setup process can take a long time, waste material and is just a straight up pain. Then additionally, with there high print costs. They use HP print cartridges with chips which the printer will only allow one use of, even though you can easily just refill them and not produce the extra plastic, waste or charge. It was a pain but we persisted using it as we had paid over $3000 for the LX2000. Fast forward to present, we had a small issue with a stuck label, no big deal we thought as its happened 100's of times. However this time after removal of the stuck label, we had issues with our upper & lower label sensors. We called tech support, and after discussion determined it was either another stuck label or the sensors. After confirming that no stuck label was present, we called back to find out that the upper and lower sensors are not available for purchase... that instead you have to purchase the whole feeder, a $650 dollar charge before shipping.  After confirming that the individual sensor parts are \"not available\" they insisted the only option was to send it in, and have them perform their duties to fix the sensors, but again at the same time consistently claimed they couldn't send me those exact parts that would be used. When I stated our frustration with the time, money and energy put forth the customer service team just simply dismissed me, not caring that I would NEVER purchase anything Primera every again. Which makes it very clear these guys are just simple scam artist who prey on unknowledgeable consumers. They nickel and dime there consumers at every opportunity. Who in their right mind should have to pay hundreds of dollars to have to send in a bulky machine because a label got stuck? How is that even reasonable? Stay away from this company at all costs. This company will waste your money, time and energy. Go elsewhere and avoid headaches."

          "Contenu": "LX3000. Looking for a good compact cost effective printer? I would not be able to recommend the LX3000. We purchased ours in April of 2022. Today on January 29th, 2023 I have been trying to print 200 3.125 x 3.125 BOPP labels for the last four hours. I have less than 20 printed. I have to stand by the machine and press the feed button every 4-labels. I have made several attempts at resets gap sensors and powered unit off/wait/on. To reset gap sensors  labels have to be removed and did as instructed, yet software states labels are still in and at same time states \"out of paper\". Prints 4 spits out 4 and stops.  We have had nothing but problems. Despite attempts from both sides to work out issues, we are still having problems with every label run.  We use their recommended label provider Hickman Labels. We have gone through 4 printer replacements and 9600 labels printed in the 8 months we have owned the LX3000, we still run into consistent issues.1. Gap Sensor issues: Consistently and on every label run we get gap sensor errors. We go through the reset process, loaf and unload, adjust alignment, reset, power off & on, call support and try to resolve. Sometimes successful, other times not. Spits out and skips massive quantities of labels costing money and time.2. Kraft Label Printing: Cannot print kraft labels without spitting out massive quantities of labels and receiving gap sensor errors throughout the print job of under 100 labels. We had to abandon printing kraft labels to accommodate the printer.3. Service: While the folks are nice and may try to help, I am 50/50 here. We run 7-days per week 7am to 7pm. If we have an issue, we cannot get support in Sundays. Some of the interactions do not result in satisfactory resolution, Some do. I have had contact from top tier and did some good work to help us. Lately though not getting response. Consistently spend hours trying to resolve issues resulting in lost time and production. Strung out on several occasions  shutting down production.6. Labels will peel off on rollers and get stuck. May be a Hickman Label problem but the result is no field serviceable capability on the LX3000 to remove a stuck label. Told by support to try using tweezers, otherwise no way to remove stuck label. Requires stopping production and sending unit for repair. I have two of these that are now unable to be used due to the stuck labels.7. Reviews: When I first had issues I was asked to take down negative review. I did this as I thought the replacement printer would work. Not so, three printers later and still having several issues. Was told by support they have hundreds of LX3000's in field with no issues. Nice to have a supplier make you feel like you are incompetent.All in all I would do a lot more research into the LX3000 before deciding on its purchase. I have learned a lot about label printers as a result of my experience I would look for the following as must haves. Good sensors technology. Ability to print the labels you need. Field serviceable label feeds. 7-days per week support."

I HAVE HAD IT ALL THESE YEARS AND HAVE ALWAYS BOUGHT ALL MY SUPPLIES FROM YOU EVER SINCE.  I FINALLY WAS LAID TO REST 2 WEEKS AGO AND I CALLED SPOKE WITH SOMEONE AT PRIMERA TO SEE WHICH WOULD FIT ME AND ASK ABOUT THE REFURBISHED AND HOW QUICK I COULD IT GET AS ALL MY PRODUCTION WAS DONE FOR MY BUSINESS WITHOUT THE PRINTER.  SHE SAID THAT THE SALE OF 8% HAD JUST BEGUN ON THE REFURBISHED SO IF I PLACED MY ORDER RIGHT THEN I COULD HAVE IT OVERNIGHTED. SO I PLACED MY ORDER ON LINE FOR A REFURBISHED PRINTER O#1000805418 $2159.91.  ONCE I RECEIVED MY PRINTER I TRIED TO GET IT TO PRINT AND WAS IMMEDIATELY HAVING PROBLEMS.  IT WAS ONLY PRINTING 1/2 THE COLOR THE OTHER HALF WAS EITHER FADED OR NOTHING AT ALL. I CALL ON THE 31ST AND SPOKE WITH TECH SUPPORT.  I THINK I FIRST TRIED GOING THRU THE CHAT BUT THEN CALLED. ANYWHO, THE PERSON I SPOKE WITH ON TECH SUPPORT WALKED ME THRU MY CLEANING, INSERTED, CLEANING ETC ETC.  NOTHING WORKED.  I ALREADY USED THE INK THAT CAME WITH IT AND THEN USED THE ADDL ONE I PURCHASED AT THE SAME TIME AS I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS THE INK?? THE TECH SUPPORT GUY SAID HE WOULD HAVE TO OVERNIGHT ME AN INK CARTRIDGE FIRST TO SEE IF IT WAS INFACT THE INK AND IF THAT WAS NOT THE PROBLEM I WOULD HAVE A NEW PRINTER OVERNIGHTED.  WELL INK CAME THE NEXT DAY AND DID NOT WORK SO I CALLED BACK AND SPOKE WITH BRENTLEY WALTERS IN TECH SUPPORT.  I HAVE TO SAY I WAS NOT NICE THE FIRST TIME AND THEN NOW THIS CALL I GOT VERY ANGRY BECAUSE BRENTLY TOLD ME THAT WAS NOT HOW THE PROCESS WORKED AND THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PURCHASE THE $600 2 YEAR EXT WARRANTY IN ORDER TO HAVE A PRINTER SHIPPED OVERNIGHT TO ME OTHERWISE I WOULD HAVE TO SEND IN MY PRINTER FOR REPAIR????!!! KEEP IN MIND THE PRINTER CAME TO MY DOORSTEP DEFECTIVE!!!!!!! I WAS FURIOUS I EXPLAINED THAT MY BUSINESS WAS PRACTICALLY SHUT DOWN BECAUSE OF THIS AND YES I WAS VERY ANGRY.  HE MADE ME GO ON LINE AND PAY FOR THE EXT WARRANT o#1000809777 TO VERBALLY GIVE HIM THE ORDER NUMBER AND MY NEW PRINTER WOULD BE SHIPPED OUT OVERNIGHT.  WELL NEXT COMES AROUND I WAITED ALL DAY UNTIL 5PM AND WENT ONTO PRIMERA TO CHECK THE TRACKING AND GUESS WHAT THE ORDER HAD BEEN CANCELED!!!!!!! NOW I AM VERY VERY ANGRY.  I CALL BACK AND TECH SUPPORT INFORMS ME THAT PRIMERA DOES NOT SELL REFURBISHED PRINTERS ONLY NEW.  I TOLD HIM HE WAS CRAZY AND HE NEEDED TO KNOW THE WEBSITE AND GAVE HIM THE ORDER #.  AGAIN, NOW IM TOLD THAT I WAS NOT ABLE TO PURCHASE AN EXT WARRANTY ON A REFURBISHED AND THAT I WOULD STILL HAVE TO SEND MY PRINTER IN FOR REPAIR.  I WAS VERY VERY HOT.  I TOLD HIM I WANTED TO SPEAK TO A SUPERVISOR AND THEN I WAS SENT TO RICHIE GRIFFITHS.  HE EXPLAINED TO ME AGAIN THAT HE WAS SORRY AND IF I GOT THE PRINTER TO FEDEX AND SENT A PICTURE OF IT AND TRACKING TO HIM I WOULD GET MY PRINTER IN MY HANDS TODAY AS IT WOULD BE OVERNIGHTED!!!!  WELL I SENT PICTURES TO HIM AROUND 10AMEST AND EMAILED AND SAID IT WAS GOING OUT. THOUGHT ALL WAS GOING TO BE GOOD UNTIL WENT ONTO TRACKING WITH FEDEX AND IT SHOWS THAT THE PRINTER WILL NOT BE DELIVERED UNTIL MONDAY!!! I HAVE NEVER NEVER NEVER BEEN MORE DISAPPOINTED WITH THE WAY I HAVE BEEN TREATED AND LACK OF CARE FOR ME AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER.  I EVEN TOLD RICHIED YESTERDAY I WOULD RATHER ORDER ONLINE A BRAND NEW ONE YESTERDAY AND PAY THE FEDEX OVERNIGHT TO HAVE IT HEAR TODAY AND RETURN THIS PIECE OF CRAP THAN TO WAIT ANOTHER DAY WITHOUT MY PRINTER.  HE ASSURED ME THAT I WOULD HAVE MY PRINTER TODAY, WHICH AGAIN WAS A LIE.  I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND YOUR COMPANY FOR ANY PRINTERS IN THE FUTURE AS I HAVE ALWAYS GAVE GREAT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOUR COMPANY BUT AFTER THIS I WILL NOT."

What I got back was a machine that would turn on, but now the robot arm would move horizontally, only one DVD drive was recognized and the lid switch was not connected so the software thought the lid was up all the time and wouldn't duplicate anything.  Nice job, Primera!  They had me ship it back (at their cost this time) and now I'm waiting to see what else they screwed up."

But what they don't tell you is that you have to spend more money on a laminate process to have waterproof cosmetic labels. But even then, the laminate only comes in specific size formats. If you need custom sizes they send you to a third party to have a custom set made, which increases the cost even more. They have a clear label, but they will not send a sample to test. They expect you to spend the $255 on the full 2 rolls. This is a giant paper weight for us and can not be used. Also, they refuse to take it back even though there is nothing wrong with the machine. We were just sold wrongly on how it would benefit us. We will not be doing business with Primera Tech in the future. Make sure you ask EVERY question you need and then some before purchasing the LX610."

Load ink cartridge. -1 to -2 labels every time you do this as the printer is programmed to spit out a blank label when the cartridge is changed. If you fail to use your printer every 3 days, the ink cartridge dries out. You must then manually rehydrate it as per their support team's directions. Again losing 2 to 3 labels to get this to work properly again. Once the ink gets down to 30-40% it frequently just stops working entirely & when it's at 0% it's often just a programming scam to get you to order more ink because it'll print another 30-50 labels in full color, but not when it's at 50% apparently. Absolutely terrible, pull your hair out trouble shooting every time you use it. Should've bought the other brand, deeply regretting it."

Now we can't print from either, and tech support can't get it working and say its Adobe and Corel problems. say we need to use Bartender software work around. Hmmm worked for months. We have tremendous numbers of files that have been designed for this printer, and a small fortune in labels. They won't fix the issue! So upset about cavalier attitude of their tech support since we purchased these. Do your self a favor and look at the Epson comparable. Work's with the main graphic software's, faster and more affordable consumables. Don't risk your business future on a company that does not support its customers and it's current products!

That was not accurate - the ink smears if it even remotely touches any form of water or condensation.  If you are running different labels at different times, it constantly advances a label so that you are wasting so many labels instead of it printing on the first available label. The software for designing the labels is not user friendly or intuitive either.  I do not recommend this product.  I've expressed these concerns to Primera and they have offered an upgrade that of course, we would pay for.  I'm not willing to spend more money and not have my problems solved.  No reimbursement has been offered for the wasted labels.Thank you for your response.  We order BOPP labels and I turn down the ink saturation.  Both of those options have been provided over the phone and I currently do both - not with the success I had hoped.  When this machine was demo-ed for us, it had beautiful multi-color labels, not barcodes."

So, I shipped it to Primera for $650 and am crossing my fingers it can be repaired.I contacted support because a label came off the backing and got stuck under the feeder. I was looking for instructions on how to remove the stuck label.Tech support recommended either sending me a service manual or shipping the LX2000 in for servicing, costing $650, not including shipping. I chose the service manual. The manual was complicated and not very helpful. I searched YouTube hoping someone else had this issue. I found a video by Primera showing how to remove a stuck label on the LX2000. I followed the directions on the video and successfully removed the label. I recommend tech support have a reference list of Primera's videos to offer the customer."

The only viable way to print with it is when you just plop a .png or .jpg file  on it but that sucks too because the print always comes out faded. The only upside to this purchase is saving pennies per label, but is it really worth it when the quality is so much worse? I might just go back to ordering labels from Avery or Staples. Supplies for this printer are not cheap either. $120 for two rolls of paper? How am I saving money with this thing again?"

Prior to purchase, we did our research and spoke to Primera and we\u2019re assured this printer would work die our needs. Unfortunately the label stock does not hold up to any moisture whatsoever which is essential for our product. We have spent hours on the phone with tech support adjusting the ink and saturation, but it has made no difference. We were advised to purchase the clear lamination that was recently released, which we did. But, the lamination film does not work on labels with a white background. It shows every spec of dust/imperfection (maybe this is a better solution for full colour labels?). We\u2019re feeling disappointed and frustrated - having invested $4k+ CDN and countless hours troubleshooting, but have no solution for our needs."

The other issue is that the printer will not function if you run out of any single cartridge. They have intentionally placed a bug in the system that will intentionally only print a partial label when a cartridge is empty. Even if you switch the settings to monochrome black it will still not function properly (this is by their intentional design). During such cases the printer is a totally useless robot that intentionally prints improperly until you pay the outrageous price to have a single cartridge shipped to you and replace it. A week later and after much inconvienience you are good to go again. I have no complaints about reliability. I like the printer."

We purchased our primera printer primarily FOR wine labels and now it appears that it is not a good use for that - even though our rep told us this printer would work specifically for this.  We ended up going through a different vendor, and are now left wondering what to use the machine for.  The only reason they get 2 stars is because of them finally accepting the labels that they recommended to us back, and after going through some red tape, they also included the shipping of said product back."

We ordered on Aug 14, 2021, and were told it would be a 1-2 week lead time which would be putting us in a tight position as we had several events coming up in Sept, mainly a beer can release on Sept 8th.  Apparently, there were issues and I was not made aware and we did not receive the printer until Sept 10th.  Then there was an issue with the Paypal credit payment (because it took so long Paypal put it on hold and then dropped it) and they threatened me with having to send the printer back if I did not pay.  Then to top it all off, one of the ink tanks did not have a chip on it so I could not use the printer.  I contacted them and instead of just sending me a new ink tank they made me send the other one back first.  Needless to say, I was out a label printer for 2 months during the busiest time of the year for our business.  The printer is up and working now and for that I am thankful, but Primera really needs to work on their customer service.  I was made to feel like it was all my fault.  We would never treat a customer like that and in fact would do everything to make it up to them.  It was a very frustrating experience."

When I use the PTPublisher, it takes anywhere from 2 minutes to 10 minutes to print each disc.  So, I always bypass it by using the Disc Cover 3 PE software.  Unfortunately, Primera locks the quantity of prints to 1.  So, I have to enter each print job, one at a time.  When you have 340 discs to print like i did last night, it can take a half hour to enter the print job.  But when you bust your butt to get a job done, then have to wait for the Primera print job, it can take 24-36 hours to print compared to manually getting it done in 4 hours.When you are manually loading jobs, you cannot use the PTPublisher's data to watch ink levels.  I have asked Primera why it takes so long to print and they just tell me the pauses are built in to let the system cool off or let programming respond to the next task.  I don't buy that, because it is very slow from the start.I have been manually entering 4000 disc per year, and it doesn't seem to overheat or have a problem with programming, printing a disc every 40-50 seconds, depending on the ink coverage (area printed).  If only they could give me a firmware to unlock the quantity of one limit, I would be totally satisfied and change my rating to 5."

It started with no assistance in using BarTender software and printer setup.  I had to teach myself how to setup and use that, then I've had glitches along the way and contacted customer support.  They are less than impressive and I get the feeling they are learning alongside with me.   They even had me go onto their website to download the manual for my printer only to find out that it was a broken link so he told me to just use a different printer model because \"it's almost the same.\" Now my printer is in for repair because a label peeled off while printing and got jammed.  A jammed label = sending printer in for repair, folks!!  I was quoted 5-7 business days for the repair.  Today is DAY 9  and nobody will respond to me regarding the status of the repair.  Also interestingly enough, I placed a low rating earlier after my purchase regarding the customer service in the beginning and they begged me to remove or edit it.  I did not and quite honestly I am glad I didn't because they have continuously proved less than stellar in the customer service area.  Always say \"they are working on the website\" or \"have new techs\".  We get a lot of positive comments about our labels and packaging.  They are beautiful.  But when we are asked what printer we are using, I will tell them and will be honest about our customer service experiences."

          "Contenu": "We have the Printer **, the spooler***** and the labeler *****.  The worst of the 3 is the printer.   very quirky.  Getting the label centered is hit and miss, the same label can print 100 times, and then all of a sudden be off the label. Also, the image will fade unexpectedly and you will have to abort and clean the print head - sometimes that works, sometimes it does not - the printer needs constant babysitting if you care about the quality of your labels.  Service is not real good, they have no loaner program and you have to send the printer in with no guarantee it will be fixed or how long they will have it.  Printer is 2 years old (bought it new), and already deemed obsolete by the vendor, some things just can't be fixed because the 2 year old printer is discontinued.  For this reason they get a 2 Star (should really be 1 star).  When it is working it is great, but the quirkiness is annoying and the repair is non existent.  When it fails we will replace with another vendor.  What would be great customer service in this case is an offer to give us some sort of credit/incentive to stay with the primera line.  But in the 2 years and the $10K + we have spent, not one offer or any type of communication has come our way - we discover the primera product strategy when the device fails and we have to call support - which I might add is not often (we deal with the quirky printer issues, primera can not fix them as it is not constant).  Oh, and did I mention the printer eats ink and it is not cheap.  The spooler and labeler have been error free in the last 2 years - they are great and hopefully will work with other printers."

For the price of the machine and for some of the accessories, there should not be issues with parts on it being level. I purchased a new machine and used it for three weeks when I decided to install the platform kit that was an extra $80. I noticed the platform was not level and therefore the food items being printed on were not level causing images to be blurry on one side. Thinking it was the platform, I removed it to check. The platform was fine and is level but the arm that it attaches to is not. After receiving a second printer to hopefully resolve the issue, it disappointingly is not resolved. The new machine has the same issue. So, buyers should read reviews and think twice before paying extra for the platform kit because you will never get a clear image with a 3 mm difference in heights between the two sides. The same issue can be seen in the video on the website for the installation of the platform kit."

For this effort I am changing my review to a #3 and if we are able to finally solve this problem I will upgrade the rating again to a #5.The chat line after 3 tries didn't help me determine my problem with the LX900 Color Label Printer. So I called twice to the customer service support line and in both cases after about 10-15 minutes the recording said sorry try some other time. So the second time it asked if I wanted a call back which I said yes and gave my phone number. After 3 days I am still waiting. I gave up and used a different printer. I have had good experience with my AP362 but cannot get this LX900 Printer do do anything. Ed Wagner"

I do not know if it is any good because without the battery I cannot test it, so you can understand though I like it generally I am not impressed with your site"

My other issue is that it only works with specific drives why not get the customer the option to purchase your awesome printer, but get there own drive. Overall the product works great and support is great."

Some rolls have tape and have been repaired in the middle of a roll. Last time I called to report a cartridge that would not work, I felt like the man I spoke with was giving me the third degree. I sent it back to you with label you emailed me.  I had to call over a week later to see if you received and were going to send me a replacement out.  When I called they had not sent a replacement, so if I had not called would you have not sent a replacement?Your pop up on website, I had tried to use once when placing an order, they told me to do it on line and not through the pop-up.  Don't have it there then."

When I finally advanced, the cart showed 3 :)!  It said one would be delayed.  I reduced it to 1 printer and checked out.  After submission, I got the backorder message in email.  You do have a message on the front, but different messaging on the actual order screens.  I was hopeful it would be here before I leave town, now I don't know.  I think the web order screens / cart need to be reviewed.  Hope this helps."

After $ 450.00 to Primera and another $ 65.85 to ship the unit, they returned the unit with a new print head.  The unit worked and had been returned with ink cartridges that they had installed.  I then tried my original black ink cartridge again.  I got the same \"ink cartridge not installed properly\" message.  After a couple times back and forth with their replacement and my original cartridge, the real problem was evident.  My ink cartridge (yes, it's an original Primera cartridge and not an aftermarket one) was the problem all along.  I would think they woud have had similar problems in the past and could have suggested the source of the problem, thus saving me close to $ 500.00."

          "Contenu": "I have had multiple Primera products over the years. Their products are mostly in a niche that no other company is competing with. This means, in part, that they are not motivated to have their products work as smoothly, or with the refinement, that one might normally expect. It also seems likely that their sales quantity is lower than would be normal for most other equipment. All this seems to result in a less refined product at a higher price, but if you need this kind of product you don't have much other choice. My biggest issues are inconsistent technical support when problems arise, glitchy and/or under-refined printer drivers and/or application software, high cost of expendables, high purchase prices, and the fact that they don't make their own print engines and are thus at the mercy of the print engine manufacturer when it comes to availability and price of ink."

It was my mistake ordering the wrong size so I can not be upset with them for that but not responding to a customer even if they were not able to accept the return is my complaint.UPDATE: After seeing this review I was notified that they assume the emails went to their spam folder and then created a ticket and sent a return label for those items to be sent back.  I would suggest maybe the spam folder to be checked if you are not seeing customer emails.  Regardless the situation is resolved."

At Primera's urging, we switched to the 53334 cartridge and now we get significantly more disks printed per cartridge. Primera even sent me a free sample and a new \"wiper\" to help clean cartridges."

I think if it had instructions it would be way better. The printer says stop, hook up to a computer first. So it is contradictory info. I YouTubed it and it still is not perfect. How will I know when my ink is low? And it does not print as quickly as advertised. There is a big pause between printing. It is better than the cheap small air printer for sure, but for the cost, it should be turn key easy. Plus it did not come with paper or ink. I mean I bought that and refills, but it should honestly have a starter checklist or something. So to improve: getting started what to buy if printing from computer or phone. And a way to talk to the phone to check ink levels or thst the paper is loose. The paper comes loose and it prints anyway!!! I have to open it and it happened mid printing without moving it too. I hear the printer going bit no prints!!! Also, please sell an inexpensive carrying case for it."

I cannot use the dvds and will go back to Verbatim inkjet printable a which are half the cost and have always worked fine. I\u2019m bummed that these didn\u2019t work out and I have to now wait for the Verbatims to arrive to finish my project, but I appreciate Patrick and others reaching out to me and trying to make it right. The first person I spoke to, Kim, just kept saying I have the settings wrong etc and I didn\u2019t really appreciate how they were corresponding with me, but Patrick and others have been great. My primera se-3 is awesome, will just use Verbatim discs from here on out."

There's so much you can do with it. The only reason for the 4 (and not 5) star review is it is glitchy.  It may stop partway through a print. It is not something you can set and walk away from. I have yet to call customer service because I have figured it out on my own - which usually consists of pressing the load or pause buttons or turn it off and back on again. I hear customer service is responsive and very good!We do find the Eddie a wonderful addition to our business and would consider purchasing another one!"

We received a shipping notification with tracking and finally had to call to see why the printer hadn\u2019t moved. Come to find out it was still sitting at Primera. After speaking with customer service, we completed our charge, the printer was shipped and received within 3 days. 2 days later however, we received an email from customer service that they needed a new card number to run through because the first one was declined. I politely emailed back to let them know we had already received our printer and it was already being used.I know communication can fail sometimes but I feel this could be better. We are loving our Eddie and are pleased with the purchase!"

Then the PTPublisher would not recognize the repaired printer even after rebooting the computer and changing cables. An email to tech support was answered by phone soon and, after eventually getting the remote control application to work, tech support cleared the problem.
