They basically said \"you guys work it out yourselves\".There aren't any FAQ's about returning items or any systems set up to follow the progress of returned items as there are with purchases. The main webpages are built from the purchase perspective. They need to imagine what it is like to be customer having to deal with a deceitful seller and then develop a seamless return process. Tracking is needed. I am relying on the seller to refund my money once he receives the item back. No way to follow the progress or enforce this event."

As of three weeks I still have yet to receive my phone that I paid more than $850 for. Buyers are more safe buying from eBay because eBay guaranteed your refund if you don\u2019t get your product. Don\u2019t trust swappa and definitely don\u2019t trust Pdx cellular solutions!"

Had to go through PayPal to get the rest of my money, took a week and some phone calls. How does that make Swappa any different/better than eBay or anywhere else you could pay with PayPal?"

Unfortunately at this time, I recommend you file a PayPal dispute to begin the forced refund process: Login to PayPal, locate and click on the payment sent to the seller, and then click on the \"Report a problem\" link. From there, you can file a dispute.\"When I asked for more details I got: \"we do not have additional details to share at this time.\"When I asked how they knew to cancel and remove the seller I got no response. I guess it is a mystery. Another interesting thing is the listing shows \"sold\", but my invoice shows \"cancelled\" and apparently no more help than what you read. $633 tied up for weeks in dispute resolution, no iphone, and some jerk is enjoying themselves. So much for \"No junk, No jerks\". Give it some thought.Update: I resent my question and did get another response from them, but it is nothing helpful: \"We are not able to give out specific information when a user is removed from the site.\" I only wish they could explain how 36min after I paid they knew it was a scam and not before they approved the listing."

I ended up losing money on the sale and paying dispute fees for no justifiable reason. Buyer was eventually removed from the platform but nothing was done to address my loses.As stated earlier the seller fees + paypal fees makes selling devices on the platform too expensive for the seller. I sold my iPhone for $540 (Customer purchased it for $570!!) and yet I got about $480 after fees. Swappa is making money off both seller and buyer and allowing Paypal to charge as well."

Furthermore, the phone still works with screen damage, so they would not take it back.  I reached at to Swappa to help moderate and resolve the issue. Their slogan is the \"safe place to buy used electronics.\"  Instead of helping me, they responded they don't resolve disputes and it is between me and the seller. Then Heather K. from Swappa \"restricted\" by account.  All this to save basically $200 on a used iPhone. I've learned my lesson, don't deal with these sites. I thought eBay was bad, by Swappa was managed to lower the bar. Well done."

Instead of accepting responsibility for selling a faulty product, the seller insisted that I contact Google Support. They informed me that Google Support needed to verify that the watch was indeed not functioning properly before accepting the return.To make matters worse, my experience with Swappa's customer support was equally frustrating. I was connected with three different representatives in the chat, but none of them provided any solutions. Instead, they left me to fend for myself in a dispute with the seller.Overall, my experience with this seller, as well as Swappa's customer support, has been incredibly disappointing and unhelpful. I would caution anyone considering a purchase from this seller to think twice, as their commitment to customer satisfaction and support is severely lacking"

I had also messaged you in the comments saying that there was a restriction for new users, but I wasn't a new user.

After some web searching I decided to set up an account on Swappa. I photographed my mint condition iPhone 14 Pro, wrote up a description and listed it for sale. But then I got a message telling me that the listing was not live and that Swappa needed additional information. Their site said I needed to write the listing number down and photograph it with the item. The iPhone was already packaged for shipping but, OK, I took it out of the box and photographed it with the item number on a piece of paper. Then I submitted it for review and.....nothing. Two days later I get a message (with zero explanation) telling me the listing was cancelled. When I inquired as to why, I was told the item had to be turned on and facing the camera with the item number next to it. I obviously would have done that had they just, you know, provided those instructions on their site. Man, what a pedantic hassle and a waste of time. At that point I was just too annoyed to go any further, thinking that if I kept jumping through hoops they would continue to add more. This was my first and last experience trying to sell anything on Swappa. Since my name isn't Marvin the Mindreader I guess Swappa isn't the place for me."

As a seller, you have no way to prevent persons outside the U.S. from purchasing your items (or from persons residing in US overseas territories). Even if you expressly state in your listing that you will only ship to US buyers residing in the CONUS, there is no way to prevent overseas buyers from purchasing items via freight forwarding services. This is important because of increased costs and risks to sellers that their goods will be lost, stollen, or damaged if the goods are sent overseas (on swappa, the sellers are responsible for all shipping costs). Not to mention buyers who might be trying to use a freight-forwarding service to circumvent US export sanctions controlsSwappa support has proved to be extremely unhelpful and slow. There is no phone or chat support and trying to cancel a transaction and issue a refund to buyers you deem an unacceptably high-risk is a nightmare."

This is a site that gives refuge to sellers selling stolen electronics, broken junk,etc., and there is virtually nothing you can do as a buyer if you are unlucky enough to buy one of these devices. It is the wild west. If you have a good experience, great. But if you don't you are out of luck.As far as prices go, eBay is very similar, and has more buyer protection. Go there.

I purchased  a phone from Cheap Phones USA through Swappa (SXFK36879) on 5/21/23. It was lost in the mail. When I finally received it on June 2, 2023, it was defective.  You could not talk and listen w/o toggling back and forth to the speaker.  I was told to reset the phone.  That did not work.  Cheap Phones USA then admitted that the phone \"did need a replacement speaker so that part may not be working.\"  Absolutely, it did not work.  So, I returned the phone in a the same padded envelope with the label emailed to me. Afterwards I received a message from Cheap Phones USA that they would not refund my money ($108.15) because the back glass and front screen were damaged.  When I put the phone in the mail, it was not damaged!  Cheap Phones USA sells cheap and defective phones.  They also do not refund customers.  Based on this horrible experience and losing over $100, I urged Swappa to discontinue business with Cheap Phones USA or intercede for me.  Swappa did not help me, but sent a quick \"too bad\" message.Buyer Beware!  DO NOT BUY A USED PHONE ONLINE THROUGH SWAPPA!"

          "Contenu": "As a buyer, I believe that SWAPPA is not very fair to people who use forwarding/reshipping services because we are always required to ask the seller if they are willing to ship their merchandise to such addresses. This causes us to wait for the seller's response, during which another buyer might beat us to purchasing the product. Additionally, in many cases, sellers become wary because they perceive risks associated with forwarding/reshipping. While it is true that risks exist, it should be taken into consideration that in the year 2023, risk is something that is present everywhere.I use forwarding/reshipping services, and there have been many instances where a 100% American seller tries to scam me by not sending the item or providing an invalid tracking number. I understand that having to ask the seller before making a purchase if they are willing to ship to a forwarding/reshipping address is somewhat discriminatory and unfair to us buyers.I also believe that SWAPPA should allow sellers to leave feedback for buyers, or at the very least, allow those buyers with a certain number of purchases and length of membership to make purchases without having to ask beforehand."

          "Contenu": "Have been selling on Swappa for over a decade, and it's gone so far downhill I don't think I'll continue to sell through this website anymore.Recently sold a phone that had hiccups with tracking numbers (that were well out of my hands and fixed fairly quickly) to an individual that let the phone sit in the mail for 5 days and then decided to accuse me of committing fraud multiple times because someone in his family picked up the phone and he didn't even realize it. I got a PayPal case started against me for no reason (which froze my account) and was berated by the buyer and continuously accused of never shipping the phone or somehow manipulating USPS shipping numbers. What's hilarious is that the numbers I provided the buyer clearly showed the delivery date/etc., so there was no reason for any of this to happen. I reach out to Swappa staff during the process and get a copy-pasted paragraph, and that's it. No actual help or intermediation whatsoever. I reached out again, and GOT THE SAME EXACT COPY PASTED PARAGRAPH from the first time. Hours later, the buyer comes clean and drops the PayPal case and admits he had actually received the phone. I ask Swappa staff for some type of punitive action for the buyer since the buyer has made defamatory statements and caused issues with my PayPal account, and Swappa staff simply says:\"It appears that the case with PayPal was resolved and that the buyer did receive the device. This was a clear issue on the buyers part, however we cannot penalize the buyer for their mistake on this part. We will notate their account regarding the sale and watch for any future behavior.\"So it would seem that there are near zero repercussions for buyers who act like this?? Combine this nightmare of an experience with Swappa's MASSIVELY increased fees over the years, and you have a marketplace that I can barely consider viable anymore. Swappa, you truly used to be great, now you've absolutely fallen by the wayside. P.S., if your staff could actually respond to my email asking why you openly allow libel from buyers on your site, that would be great. Still haven't heard back! Truly seems like you can't be bothered to do anything to support your sellers."

It was after your third FAIL Swappa, so it was far too late to win me over. I told the rep. as much and even shared the Trustpilot review with him. Quite nervy of awful Swappa to try to blame me cause they FAILed thrice: {NOTE, Swappa, how your reply is all about trying to save face instead of simply saying,  \"Sorry you had trouble with ordering. That's not our aim, so let's see how we can remedy this situation\". In fact, your reply demonstrates FAIL #4, and still demonstrates no interest in addressing the problem presented at the first.} What a wretchedly horrible customer service experience you provided, again, and again, and again. What a tremendous FAIL.  And this time on Trustpilot before everyone.  that you failed miserably, then came back after multiple fails.... Now, off to google, yelp, and so on the share about this abysmal experience.Trustpilot REVIEW::::: Good customer service takes a problem and resolves it.I wanna buy a new iphone Pro Max so I attempted to order one on Swappa. But both credit cards, and Venmo failed to process for the payment. So I took the following steps: 1. Contacted my bank about credit card; no problems identified.2. Contacted Swappa and received a canned, non specific unhelpful response, which paragraphs later, advised me to contact my bank {already done}.3. Contacted seller {he said to contact Swappa}Bottom line? Neither Swappa or the seller cares to help the customer navigate their system when a hiccup in the process is encountered. Similarly, Swappa and the merchant cared nothing for the problem, or the sale. Ultimately,  I chose a competitor, and learned to never trust Swappa with a sale again.Waited for someone at Swappa actually own the problem and solve it which is what good customer service does."

I'm not super \"techy\", and admittedly don't understand all about networks and unlocked phones. Bought an unlocked phone, and upon receipt quickly noticed it can't be used with Verizon. I had used a Google search's 1st hit info to define \"unlocked\" (my bad, I guess), which said unlocked phones can be used with any carrier of choice. Phone wouldn't recognize sim upon arrival. Went through particular heck, costing me tons of time and money to try to figure out why it wouldn't work. Seller repeatedly tried to convince me it could be used, and that Verizon was giving me false info. Like, why would they?? Swappa was no support, and I had to ask them to step in, even tho I had checked their little box for them to be involved in all of our comments (I had a feeling things would go south with seller). When I asked in a comment for Swappa to step in (because they weren't about to otherwise), they immediately jumped to seller's defense. Now seller will accept a return if I pay for return shipping. No thanks. I've lost enough money on this useless phone already. In my opinion, Swappa needs to recognize that not everyone understands all the \"techy\" stuff and jargon. In my opinion, when an \"unlocked\" phone is being purchased, Swappa should help the buyer understand the risks associated, and a pop-up or something should alert the buyer to check the IMEI with their carrier. I didn't understand all of this before, but I do now. Was an expensive education! Swappa could really help their buyers AND sellers, with a little bit of upfront support! Would that really be that hard? All you are is a glorified middleman, collecting your fees, but not actually being of help to anyone. Used to be different. Shame on you Swappa! I believe I'm done with you, since you are basically useless anyway. Sad, so many years of good experiences, and you were willing to just wave goodbye as the door hit me in the butt, on my way out. Should have stood by your good principles, instead of selling out to the \"don't care\" entitled crowd.**Added after Swappa response: Yep. Just like I said in my review, why would I want to pay to return it, after all the expenses I've already been thru? But this review is about you, Swappa, and the fact that you don't offer info for \"dummies\" that don't know or understand all this techie stuff. You used to have it together, Swappa, but now you're pretty much useless. Your sole purpose is only to take money from sales. No point."

You and the seller initially agreed to a $75 partial refund, and then you attempted to double that to $150 after the seller did not respond as quickly as you expected.\"The Seller only agreed to a $75 partial refund after 4 days of non-responsiveness during which I had to deal with PayPal for hours on end to start the dispute process. At that point, I was fed up with his antics and upped the refund to $150 but then brought it back down to $75. PLEASE TELL THE WHOLE TRUTH SWAPPA AND STOP SIDING WITH THE SELLER!\"We also took issue with the fact you were using the device and delaying the return until your next phone purchase arrived, which you confirmed to us via email.\"So you take issue with me using the phone but you don't take issue with the Seller being non-responsive after he listed and sold a USED/DAMAGED phone as NEW for over $1,000?!?!I explained to the Swappa rep why I was using the phone because after I had won the bid for this Seller\u2019s phone, I listed and sold my only phone (ON SWAPPA!!) and this used/damaged phone was the only device I had to use in the meanwhile but the Seller was very slow and delayed in response.Beyond this, the Seller was using profanity and responding with rude, accusatory language/words and Swappa never took issue with his inappropriate language/words. But of course, Swappa took issue with me when I simply tried to speak logically/frankly. I have the screenshots of the correspondences..it was rather UNREAL how BIASED Swappa acted against me.Here's but a few examples and let's let the reader decide who was biased and in the wrong...but nice try Swappa.How about admitting to your bias/wrong and simply apologizing? Not sure I'll ever be using your platform again.WsKmisc Buyer - Apr 30, 2023 - 08:30 PMUmmm...is this Swappa policy or guideline?

Sheesh.Dale K Staff - Apr 30, 2023 - 09:14 PMWsKmisc, we don't allow strong arming people into a higher refund. You already said you would accept $75. Now saying you'll only accept $150 or demand a refund is not appropriate.If you simply would just prefer a return for a refund due to the condition, that's fine but $75 was the amount you said you initially wanted and your seller agreed.WsKmisc Buyer - Apr 30, 2023 - 09:22 PMI'm not strong-arming anyone or anything. Judge much, Dale? For whatever reason, you are exhibiting tremendous partiality towards Ryan.If I didn't have to spend over 2 hours calling and working with PayPal to get the dispute started up, and if I hadn't sold my own device, then all would be somewhat fine but a lot of time and effort has been wasted.Yes, I would simply prefer a full refund for a return of the device.

I wanted to help out smaller companies against giants like Amazon, but I see now that so many of these smaller companies would rather make the quick buck than conduct business ethically.*EDIT*Because of your continued insistence on remaining obtuse on this issue, I have done the bare minimum work needed to resolve this issue on your end:Go to this site:https://www .verizon.co m/sales/byod/devicedetails/imei.htmlInput the IMEI number you sold me and find out that the phone IMEI is unusable. This should have been the first and only step in this entire process. I cannot believe this has been dragged on so long when a 5 second google search could have solved all my issues. \"Go to Verizon and get a printed piece of evidence\" is what your \"customer service\" told me to do.

          "Contenu": "I thought I was purchasing a phone listed for 485.00$, but was charged a 15.00 Swappa fee. Plus tax.  When I contacted Swappa, the customer service agent said The 485.00 is the seller's ask price, not the list fee. So, I am paying 500, which included the Swappa fee.  As a buyer, I think it's misleading and shady, to list products in this way.  When I contacted customer service and sent screen shots of my receipt that did not include the breakdown of the swappa fee and seller's ask price, but did show the 485.00 number, he was condescending and rude to me. He was unable to clarify anything and eventually sent me to another person when I asked for a manager.  The entire experience left a bad taste in my mouth and I am not going to use Swappa again because of it."

The first purchase I made was still tied to a carrier. When I tried to activate it on Verizon, they wouldn't let me because the phone still had payments due. Swappa checks the IMEI, but doesn't check if the phone is still being paid off. Reaching out to Swappa's support just points you to get your refund through PayPal.For the second purchase I made, the seller listed \"Mint\" condition but sent a phone with a bunch of scratches on the screen. Again, support only points you to PayPal.I was able to get refunds for both of my purchases (eventually) through PayPal, but both of these issues could have been prevented by Swappa.Also, I was the one paying for return shipping and never got reimbursed.I sent an email to Swappa's support and never heard anything."

I don't buy from wholesalers anymore on Swappa because Swappa allows them to get around the rules (photos of device, listing phones of poor quality as good, no response from sellers on questions about the phones).  They are hard to find, but if you use Swappa, use the independent sellers.  They want to earn your positive feedback and give you an accurate device and great purchasing experience.  Unfortunately Swappa has become the antithesis of their roots bending to the whims of wholesalers and being greedy on fees."

During this time Swappa didn't allow me to cancel, I was forced to wait however long USPS might take. I had an international trip coming up and it barely made it before my departure. This is an unusual risk when buying from Swappa, compared to a big retailer that permits refusing shipment electronically, rerouting the package back to shipper etc. So even though Swappa wasn't at fault, they haven't addressed the scenarios when their shipping partners mess up. This results in the buyer being powerless, waiting for weeks, instead of cancelling and ordering from elsewhere. Next time I need a device, I will think twice before engaging with these risks."

After a visit to my local verizon we couldn't get the 3 sim's we tried to work, manager stated it must be a bad phone. I decided to return to seller for a refund, with very little directions from swappa. I insured the return package, which never arrived (per Seller) USPS said they have GPS of delivery. Now I'm waiting the minumim time limit to file an insurance claim. Very little directions or suggestion from swappa. lessons learned insurance for $500 no signature required but insurance for $501 signature required. I started an insurance claim on 5/07/2023, as of today 05/15/2023 it's still under review by USPS"

One notable concern is the fees charged by Swappa, along with the additional fees imposed by PayPal. This double fee structure can be frustrating for users. Moreover, when a transaction involves foreign currency, sellers often incur losses, which seems unfair. Despite these shortcomings, Swappa remains a highly user-friendly platform that streamlines the buying and selling process. It would be great if the fees could be reevaluated to ensure a fairer and more transparent pricing structure. Additionally, addressing the issue of currency conversion and its impact on seller profits would greatly enhance the overall experience for international transactions."

I also received subpar support through the buyer\u2019s page. I had to reach out to email to get my issue resolved.In all, I would advise only buying unlocked phones from Swappa to avoid any hassles. I was not able to use my preferred cell provider (ting) nor return the phone. Looking up IMEI numbers for compatibility was not reliable in my case and Swappa will not side with you if things go wrong. The lesson for me was: Be careful and only buy completely unlocked phones.

He wasn't responding to email or in-app Swappa chats, so I had to Google the person, find their place of employment, and text them there. C'mon people! Swappa's only recommendation when contacted was \"well you can file a case with PayPal\". Really? Swappa literally washed their hands of it right when I needed them most. So my recommendation to BUYERS is do not buy a phone unless the seller shows clear proof the device is wiped and ready to activate by the new owner. My recommendation to Swappa is to require PROOF that the device is wiped and ready, in addition to providing pictures with their listing showing proof. For the $150 I saved, I coulda just gone direct to the AT&T store and bought the phone there with WAY less trouble and toil."

It does become more clear once you actually list an item if you pay very close attention to the numbers and do some math. Here is how it actually works out: You list something for $100. The buyer will pay 100 plus their local tax. The seller however will get about $94.09 from swappa, almost 6% less than the list /sold price. Through some really odd fuzzy math, they drop the list/sold price by 3% and then have the buyer pay the actual list price. It makes it seem on paper they are getting 3% from the buyer. But all they did is take 3% off and then add it back. For the seller, they take that lower number with the 3%  taken off (97.00) and then take 3% off that number (94.09) That\u2019s what the seller gets. Essentially the buyer pays the list price and the seller gets almost 6% less than the list price. I\u2019m fine with this, it\u2019s still slightly less of a hit than ebay. What is really confusing is that they state in many places that the buyer and seller each pay 3%. Using my example of 100. Buyer pays 100. Seller gets about 94.09 before PayPal fees. Why not just say \u201cwe charge the seller 6%\u201d ? That\u2019s what is really happening."

My experience is they are ALWAYS right and you are ALWAYS wrong...even when you are obviously right with documented proof to back it up. You\u2019re good once you get the listing approved but be prepared to go through a rigorous, unnecessary process.

What I don't like is that there are a lot of business sellers, who I heard just push out 100's of phones without really checking them. If you check their reviews, they may have 1000's of good reviews but 100 bad reviews. So it's better to buy from private sellers with a few good reviews. But it was hard to find much private sellers for some phone models.I don't like how business sellers are allowed to post placeholder images for their listings, so they can sell a bunch of phones but post a generic image. (there is a disclaimer though)Also Swappa doesn't include battery life in the condition requirements, so you can buy a good condition phone except the battery isn't as good. That's what happened to me, so it's not like I can claim Paypal protection. I should've asked about the battery condition before buying, I guess. Still the seller was very good otherwise so I didn't want to trouble with returning the phone. (a private seller)"

Apparently there is some fine print that lets them charge you $18 if the slightest thing goes wrong with the delivery--and I read that this is a big cash cow for them. That more than doubled the original shipping cost."

I use Verizon so called to setup on Esim but Verizon rep could not do so and said I needed a nano card.  Went to Verizon store to get card and they somehow acivated using eSim.  Since then, decided to switch to US Mobile using eSim on their Verizon system but they said that eSim had some kind of eSIm restriction.  They checked compatibility on their GSM system and said the phone is compatible.  Apparently the phone (verified as unlocked as described) is not truly open to all carriers via eSim which adds disappointment to dealing with Swappa.  I am waiting on a US Mobile nano card which will supposedly overcome the US Mobile Verizon eSim restriction."

Due to the \u201crisky\u201d nature of selling and buying electronics via PayPal, my PayPal account was permanently frozen, with the funds from the sale of my phone held and unavailable to me for 6 months. After an internet search, this is not uncommon with Swappa transactions. It would have been nice to get a heads up from Swappa that this was a possibility. My phone was older, bit having closer to $1000 held by PayPal would have been really disappointing."

When I clicked on contact seller, I wasn't able to ask my questions.  One of my questions was whether it had a SIM card or not (it didn't).  The description said that it was kept in an Otterbox case while they used it - I wanted to ask if I could buy that case too, but I couldn't ask.  So, if you could make it possible to contact sellers BEFORE making a purchase, that would be very helpful.  But, I saved a lot of money by buying on SWAPPA versus new, Thank you!"

I feel like I've always gotten the best deals for used Android phones from anywhere around, and they have excellent customer support. I always feel safe when purchasing with Swappa.Sellers are vetted and motivated and ship quickly, and the site is organized in a way to where if you need a specific model (like for CDMA Verizon only) it's very easy to filter and narrow down.However, on non-phone items I've found other sites (particularly eBay and Amazon) to be much better deals. For example, smartwatches. There seems to be a large premium on Swappa for those for some reason.The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is due to an odd scenario that I've found where Swappa links up with a big reseller and doesn't make them post the individual photos of the item with the timestamp/code. They just say that you will get an item that is representative of the stock photos they have. From my understanding, if you are a small time seller or individual you still must provide the photos of the actual item. Thankfully, I've always gotten phones that are representative of the example pictures. But I would rather they require the big sellers to show the individual items."

I think it would be clearer to have good, excellent, and then mint conditions instead of excellent being a descriptor of a phones listed as good\u2026it\u2019s confusing and led to a more drawn out complicated purchasing process."

Any time I've had a question or an issue (and I have), the Swappa staff is very, very fast to respond with clear, helpful support.  The things that annoy me are that international buyers still get through and you can get slapped with a surprise international fee from PayPal.  This happened on my very first sale and it was a minor headache to sort out, but it worked out in the end.  Speaking of PayPal, that's my second gripe.  Give me more options, with better fees, for managing my payments.  And finally, when I'm listing something, I'd love to not have a public comment area where people make lowball offers.  Let people make offers, but keep it private to me (or at least give me that as an option)."

My phone is now activated by my new wireless carrier and is working just fine. Overall, this ended up being a good experience for me. Hopefully, the phone will last me for quite some time.

          "Contenu": "I really enjoy most everything Swappa does. I love that listings are verified before they can be posted, so it's more likely my purchase is from someone honest.I don't like that businesses can be run from an \"individual\" account--if someone has posted more than a dozen listings per year, they shouldn't be able to qualify as \"individual\". Especially because, when I search for \"individual\", I'm looking for people who are selling their own devices. I want that added familiarity with the device, so when I ask questions they are able to answer, etc. Not someone mass-marketing devices.I also really wish Swappa required a bit more information and pictures for a listing. For an unlocked phone, I'd like to know who the original carrier company it was made for was, as some phones have different bands they operate on, and just because it is \"unlocked\" doesn't necessarily mean it will operate as well on other carrier networks. I also think pictures to verify certain things should be required--such as battery capacity or original carrier. I know we are allowed to return/refund transactions that aren't what they claim, but that could wind up being a huge hassle, when all it would take are a couple extra images to verify."

The Google Pixel 6A was in my price range on Swappa, has a ton of memory + everything I need.  I am so glad I made this purchase.  The Pixel arrived in perfect condition and was easy to set up. It performs flawlessly and was an easy transition.  Unlike the sometimes glitchy Samsung, I have had no problems with connections, settings, or gestures on the Pixel.  It's just an excellent cell phone."

          "Contenu": "This is from a buyer's perspective, not a seller. Whenever I see a piece of tech that I want, but I feel like I can find a better deal elsewhere, I ALWAYS go back to Swappa. Unlike Amazon or Walmart, where sellers of refurbished items use polished, generic product pictures for their used tech, Swappa sellers are required to use their own pictures and SEVERAL at that. If the product has a ding, scratch, or crack, you'll know about it. Of course, there are many products in 'Mint' condition as well, if you like that feeling of opening a product for the first time.I've bought an iPhone, iPad, Samsung tablet and even a Nintendo Switch. Sometimes from sellers that (dun dun DUNN...) didn't even have reviews...or profile pictures, at that. We've all read the eBay horror stories; rocks in boxes--the works, but Swappa is different. I didn't have any issues with any of these purchases, and all devices work, even the used iPhone, 2+ years later.Swappa is easy to navigate and organize. Only two downsides: sometimes the deals are too good that they disappear in a flash and there is not THAT much of product variety beyond phones/tablets. That's no fault of theirs, just a sad lil' note from someone who is tech obsessed. And still, you can still find other things like consoles/cameras/shoes, apparently? Hopefully, as they gain popularity, a bigger variety of tech will be offered on a consistent basis. But whatever they are doing to maintain this level of trustworthiness and reliability between their sellers and buyers, don't stop."
