I registered for their platform a week ago and opted for the paid plan. I've sent over 4 emails seeking support, but have yet to receive a response. Instead, I continually receive their automated newsletters. My concern is the time I'm investing in creating lists and uploading products. Even their test mode doesn't seem to function, making me feel as though I'm adding products that only I can view. Their lack of responsiveness has been an issue from day one. Moreover, they advertise a free 14-day trial before your card is charged, but with this level of service, I'm hesitant to invest any more of my time"

I replied back clarifying that I would be happy with a chat walk through, I haven't heard back since."

          "Contenu": "On the surface SendOwl looks pretty reasonable with its $15\u201340 of monthly fee and $0.04\u20130.03 per transaction, in addition to your Stripe fees.What's not so obvious however, is that the Stripe tariff SendOwl will apply is not the same tariff that you see in your Stripe account. It's not something SendOwl will show you in its plan comparison but a rather small print below: \"2.9% + $0.30 for merchants located in the United States. Add 2% for merchants located outside the United States\".Yes, that's right: with SendOwl you pay 4.9% + $0.30 even for for standard European cards instead of 1.5%  + \u20ac0.25 that you would have paid if just using Stripe checkout. And don't forget to add SendOwl monthly fee plus $0.04\u20130.03 per transaction on top.So, in reality, trading via SendOwl will cost you 6\u20138% on average, depending on your prices, compared to 3.5\u20134.5 of Stripe checkout.What's the takeaway? As usual: be careful, do your own research, do your maths and always read small print."

Their response was that they couldn't help. What? They don't know how their own app works? Well I am disgusted. In the end I pursued and eventually managed to get it onto my kindle library all by myself  but with great difficulty and frustration. The company should be able and keen to advise how to get their app onto one's reading list. If they can't advise,  who can??? Terrible service."

Telling them where it was on the buyers receipt which I didnt have access to at the time, so they could copy and paste it across easily was apparently not telling them where the email address was. And they couldnt simply tell me that they couldnt access that screen or were unable to do it that way.Also the discount codes often do not work but apparently they do - despite me being told regularly by customers that they cant get them to work.

I experienced multiple download fails, which tended to get counted as a download even though they hadn't completed, and attempts to resume a partial download were usually rejected with a forbidden server response. I resorted to downloading to a cloud server instead, which succeeded due to the much higher bandwidth, and then downloading from the cloud server to local. I wouldn't want this hassle in the future so am unlikely to order anything else from the company who used SendOwl, and strongly recommend looking elsewhere if selecting a service to handle your digital downloads."

Our checkout has been down for the majority of the day once again. This marks the third time this has happened since May 2023. We've relied on SendOwl since 2015 to facilitate the sale of our software. We are using the well-designed SendOwl API to drive our web store and previously, we were staunch advocates of its simplicity and reliability for anyone interested in vending digital products. Recent developments with SendOwl have left us puzzled, as we now find ourselves actively exploring alternative solutions. It had been working excellently until it suddenly faltered. While I acknowledge that our specific use case might differ from that of most users, and it's possible we may have expected too much, the fact remains that it worked and then it didn't. So, if you're planning to sell just one PDF a day, it might be acceptable on most occasions. However, if your sales involve dozens of items per day, I strongly recommend conducting thorough testing of this service before fully committing. A loyal user left disappointed."

However, recently it started to display a 404 error in our store (\"404Sorry, we can\u2019t find that page\") after a customer switches the currency. The problem is caused by broken cookies and could be relatively easily fixed on their end. However, customer support says:\"So I have spoken with our development team and they have been over this issue at length, however, unfortunately, it is a real headscratcher and we have not been able to find the root of the issue.\"They now flat out refuse to fix the problem or even to provide a simple workaround (a way to clear the cookies). Instead, they suggest we change our web site, making it more cumbersome for customers to switch currencies.This is unfortunately not the only issue but the real showstopper. Other issues we were having:- download links suddenly stopped working- no translations possible for parts of the checkout- SendOwl displaying the rather unhelpful error message \"Well that didn't work\" to customersUnfortunately, this is the end of the road for us with SendOwl.Update (May 2022):The 404 error issue has now been fixed (about a year after first reporting it). We are still using SendOwl as switching e-commerce solutions is tedious for us and our customers. We can now recommend SendOwl for small businesses which can live with its limitations:- no localization of certain content (product names, upsells)- little control over existing orders (VAT numbers, download restrictions)- little flexibility with certain options (e.g. download validity limited to a fixed list between 1 day and two years)"

          "Contenu": "I've been using SendOwl since 2017 to sell MP3s for my podcast, Literature and History (literatureandhistory.com). I'm puzzled by all of these bad reviews, because as a merchant, the service has been totally flawless. It's easy to use, reasonably priced, and I sell a lot of GB of products every month there.I'm afraid that some of these angry reviews are due to purchasers who are blaming the service (SendOwl) for negligent content providers (like musicians or podcasters) who aren't replying to emails, or configuring the file distribution service correctly for their own customer bases. SendOwl is just a file distribution service, and in my experience, it works perfectly. Once in a while you'll get a customer who's not very computer literate and doesn't know how to download files, or move them into different file folders, but good grief, that's not the distribution service's fault, and SendOwl makes it INCREDIBLY easy to issue refunds, give discount codes, and otherwise help these folks out.So, as a merchant with literally thousands of satisfied customers who have used this simple service, it's outstanding. Again, go to my website (above) and you can see how I have Bonus Content set up for sale - SendOwl is great!"
