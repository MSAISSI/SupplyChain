As my daughter grew older and I decided to transfer her savings to a traditional bank account, I was informed that this option was not available. Consequently, I now have to incur ATM fees to withdraw her cash and deposit it into a real bank account. I am dissatisfied with the way these situations were handled. While Busy Kid serves as a basic means of monitoring a child's spending, it proves challenging for a responsible child who wishes to progress and transition to the next phase of financial growth."

So, without the ability to see their balance, my kids just keep trying ...We spent probably $60 or more in the last 3-4 months on decline fees. I have a feeling, the company does it on purpose (preventing kids from reviewing their balance and charging outrageously high \"decline fees\"... None other debit or credit cards charge these fees. But this company is hunting our kids for these $0.5)"

The confirmation was only for the two kids and things seemed good. Until a day later when my third child tried to use his card and was declined. Only to find out someone messed up and accidentally cancelled his card too. Wife had to leave work in order to go to my child and pay for his items he needed. Now I\u2019ve cancelled everything with them and won\u2019t use again or recommend.Update 9/15/23: I was contacted with an apology and was considering changing my review until the customer support person suggested for me to change my review in an email. Appears they only cared enough to apologize so that I\u2019d change this review and not about the mistakes and time/embarrassment it caused."

This makes no sense with when the transactions happen only when I transfer the money and it always immediately a double transaction (same amount of money twice at the same time)!  I have requested a call back but they only keep emailing me.  Then they tell the transactions are coming from my home address every time when I did my last transaction while at my work address and no one was home at the time.

It should be taken care of by the app.  I like the way they have the stock set up that you click on it and the kid has the stock.  That was also a challenge to get set up and I accidentally sent $10 to the stock site from my child's busy kid debit card by mistake but I figured out how to do it right eventually.  The app needs to have better step by step instructions.  I'm going to continue to try and use this app mostly because I have already spent the money to get my children their debit cards and because they are excited about it.

It's also annoying that communication with busykid is through email only  and once you get a response they will most likely not be able to assist you but refer you to the card issuer who has a limited function. Also, Im not sure how the kids login to there accounts to view balances because I am unable to unlock each card... I was interested in Greenlight for the kids but chose Busykid because the fees were less and the feature of donating to charities etc. is a great idea. But, at this point Im unsure how its going to work out because I am currently in the sunken place with the app."

Reached out to customer service again. I was assured it would be here any day and they would continue to follow up with me until the card arrived. We will see how this pans out or if I will receive the card. At least customer service responds rather quickly - whether they have a resolution or not. I do sincerely appreciate that. ***edited to add that this card was ordered July 9th and the change of address was requested on July 10th. ***Update - I did receive a card and although had issues \"unlocking\" it in the app upon receipt, it did work the following day. With the delays aside (although a bit frustrating, it wasn't the end of the world), I personally would suggest obtaining a debit card through your financial institution. It is cool that kids can check off chores as they complete them but the same could be done via a sticker chart or any other chart. There is also a significant delay when loading the allowance to the card. I will probably cancel this and go through my bank. The customer service representatives are responsive so that is a plus."

Is there something I'm doing wrong or is there just no way for it to be available immediately each time I add money to one of their accounts?!"

This \"BusyMom\" would like to set up the chores once and not have to check and modify them each week.  Here is what would be great to have:   * Allow the assignment of a single chore to rotate between kids based on the day of the week.  For example, if I want to have each of my 3 kids vacuum one day a week on different days, I have to create the chore 3 different times.   * Have the ability to set a repeat to happen every other week (you can have a chore repeat daily, weekly, or monthly).- Have a daily reminder notification to remind kids to do their chores.I feel that if they really work on making the chore area of their app more robust, BusyKid will be leaps and bounds ahead of all of their competition by a mile!"

A couple of things we are having a hard time with. 1. The inability to move money off of the card. Once it's on, you cant take undo it. 2. Inability to pause card usage. My son accidentally put in for an automatic payment instead of a 1 time payment and the company kept trying to run the payment and the card kept declining. We couldn't figure out how to cancel the payment so I went to see how to freeze the card. You can only report card as lost or stolen. 3. Maybe there is this and I have missed it in the instructions, but a way to not allow automatic payments. This isn't the fault of the card and I'm not even sure it's a possibility, just an idea."

The usability for the chores could be better. I wish there was a way to add my own chore and keep it so it pops up when I \u201cadd chores\u201d instead of only being able to select from the preloaded chores. Also, I would love to be able to list the chores each child is assigned in the optimal order for completion. For example brushing teeth in the AM should be followed by making the bed, not brushing teeth PM. Finally, scrolling for the date is confusing. When using the toggle to go to the next week, I would prefer for the highlighted day be the first day of the week, not the day of the week that was highlighted when scrolling. For example if I\u2019m on Wednesday, but I want to see the next week, I want the highlighted day to be Sunday. The reason for this is, if I\u2019m scrolling to the next week, I\u2019m scrolling to view the next week as a whole, not next Wednesday. Also, my children often accidentally check off chores for the next week instead of the current week because they get confused and think the arrow takes them to the next day. I\u2019ve taught them to make sure the date matches the date we are on, but still, this would easily resolve if the arrow took you to the beginning of the week."

IE: Chicken Chores with our own Chicken photo. We like that the chore amounts to be paid are editable as well. We're not a family that's going to pay $2.00 for our child showering, so that is a great feature.Why we've given it 3 stars: Cannot edit paydays, doesn't keep a running allowance to be paid if you don't pay on the 1st and 15th - which in our family we don't. We pay bi-weekly (like we are paid). We don't like the function that is built in that allows us to pay the \"missed payday\" - we also do not like this membership to use the app needs to be paid upfront for a year. Some families cannot afford that. You may not believe it's a large upfront cost for some families, but it is and that shouldn't deter a family from trying to incorporate the value of money. We also tried to use the BusyKid cards at a POS and use the debit function and the pin # doesn't work. When we received the cards it said that the pin # is the last 4 digits of the main phone # that registered the account, either we are wrong or there is a glitch with this. We also give it 3 stars because we're not necessarily wanting to invest in the stock market, use the save option (which we find unclear on what that option actually is) and there will be a max of $2K the cards can hold (which seems unclear as well and if that's divided between all categories). I suppose at that point we'll just move the money to a banking system so that the children can continue to be paid for their chores. We have continued to use this chore app as it has been something our (11 & 8) year olds have enjoyed and has held us all responsible for our parts of being a family unit.I have recommended the app and find it is useful - but some tweaking of the app would also be useful."

Three years later, the kids are on autopilot with chores and have learned good saving and sharing habits. Thank you for the tool."

The chore list is easily modified, you can set reminders and payout automation.  The only issue we have had is with the provided card working at some locations.  This has been a disappointment to my daughter as she looked to spend money with her own card independently.  That said, the CEO himself responded the same day to provide feedback and support for this and they are actively working to fix these issues.  Overall a great app and tool for kids and their parents."

They should just be declined, I don't believe kids should be charged these feesThanks for responding so fast!!!  Amazing! I would love to leave a reply, but don't feel as if this is the best place.  Overall, I love the app/card and praise it to anyone whenever asked about it. Our experience has been great and it is a prefect way to teach kids about credit without them getting into trouble."

There have been times my kid has accidentally signed up for a recurring charge, didn't realize what he was doing because he's a kid. So when the next charge comes through and gets denied bc he doesn't have enough in his card, we get charged a fee. Or when he has only $10 on his card but his total at the store is $11, it gets declined. He thinks it's because he put in his pin number wrong or whatever and has the cashier try again and again and we get charged the fee. That's really my only complaint with busy kid. Aside from the fact that we are incurring fees for dumb things our kids do bc again, they're kids and are learning how to manage money and the importance of earning it, I have no complaints!"

That is fine if everything goes correctly, but is a black box of nothingness when you are trying to figure out if the cards actually shipped, when they shipped, where they shipped from, and when I should start worrying. Everything else ordered online and shipped here in 2022 seems to generate more emails/notifications than I need. Having no information was frustrating.Once received cards were activated through the app. I changed the funding source (I think you can only have one - ?). It would be easier for someone like me who usually has two or three full-size screens within arms reach with the password manager to work with a web page instead of reaching for the tiny screen and having to copy and paste 16-char random passwords from the password manager since the password manager screen overlay wasn't working in-app when adding (changing) funding sources, but I realize I may be an edge case there. Sometimes things are easier from mobile, sometimes things are easier from a web page. I think it would be nice to have a web page to manage the account as an option.Once up and running the app looks straightforward. With only hours sunk into the process there isn't too much to report back on so far.Original Review:According to the app the last activity was July 30, new card processed. It is now Aug 27. Is there a new card still on the way? Is there a problem on their end? Did it get lifted from our mailbox? Is there an ETA?"

          "Contenu": "I love this app I think it's one of the best if not the best one out there I love how you can put chores on there and put amounts on there and then the child can go in and mark off the ones they did and that the end of each week the parents are notified of what they should be getting and that you have a chance to verify that they did in fact do the chores and then you get to pay them onto a card that they have access to that's awesome The only absolute only discrepancy I see in the whole system is it's actually very difficult for me to move money from my son's card to my account. So for some reason my son needs cash and so I want to move it to my account to take it out and you I think if you put it onto the card to be used as a credit and then you change your mind it's nearly if not completely impossible to move it back to where you used to have it I haven't completely figured that all out so I can't really say that you can't do it If you can it's difficult. That's such a minor minor minor issue for me. All of the other benefits absolutely outweigh that one negative"

          "Contenu": "When I signed up and money was going in, things worked very smoothly. I tried to close the account when they changed from a monthly premium to an annual contract.  Now, when money flows in the other direction things are a mess.  I started corresponding with \"Scott M\" via email.  He was VERY quick to respond to all emails and he supposedly closed the account and sent me the check in mid Dec.  After two weeks I followed up and was told the check was sent and that if I did not get it by weeks end he would have a new one sent.  The week ended and I never got it and now Scott has gone dark.  No response for 5 days.  So now I call back and am told the account was never actually closed and they will do so now and that I will have to call again to have the check sent.  All this on top of a claim that the account holds less than half of the funds that I was told were in there originally.  I'd like to look at the transaction history but I can no longer see any details of the account in the app and have been locked out (does this mean it actually was closed?). What a mess.  I look forward to the Presidents response to this like all the other complaints on here.  If you are looking for a credit option for your kids, do yourself a favor and look for another solution.Edit: Literally the next day the President reached out and made an apology and a good offer to keep my business.  I accepted.  I think their systems are pretty mucked up but I have to appreciate the effort to make things right.  Adding 2 stars."

          "Contenu": "BusyKid is a great idea for several reasons but sometimes there are \"glitches\" that can cause real problems. Pros:* Total control over how much money kids get* 100% visibility into where the funds are spent* Self-contained so parent's funds are not at risk* Widely accepted (on-line, retail, etc...)* Kids can see how much money is in their account* Deposits to account can be allowance or a \"bonus\"* Bonuses generally available immediately* Helps kids manage their funds and plan purchases* Set up is pretty simple and user friendly* Easy way to send emergency fundsCons:* Occasional lag in crediting bonuses to kid's account* Fees when the card is declined ($0.50/per)* Some transactions not permitted (Venmo)* No way for kids to deposit funds if they have income* Little to no live customer support* Lag time in responses from customer supportOverall, this is a descent solution for our purposes. We have 1 kid in college and 2 in high school. All are driving so gas money and some money for food is always needed. We used to let them use a credit card but we had no control over spending until after the fact when they racked up big bills. This helps significantly and it is generally seamless once it is all set up. One key tip is that many transactions require a PIN and the kids need to set that up. We had a few glitches when the kids thought they were using the correct PIN but we learned that we did not set that up properly. Once that was done, things started working much better and there were no more declines. I would say that this is the best way to go if you give a regular allowance and the kids can stick to it. It is a good solution to send emergency funds too but the occasional lag in crediting the kid's card could be a problem is there is a real emergency. I deducted one star for 3 reasons: 1) lag in crediting bonuses to the kid's account, 2) lack of real-time customer service, and 3) the process to set up a PIN was not obvious. That said, I do recommend this for parents who need a way to control and monitor the money given to the kids."

          "Titre": "BusyKid Setup works but needs a few tweaks",
          "Contenu": "We have been using the BusyKid App for over one year, and it works well. We have two accounts, one for each child. My daughter's account had a few fraud charges hit at the beginning but Support took care of it within a few days, no issues there. My son's account has never had any problems to date so far. This posting is to put in the RADAR for BusyKid, hopefully, the following issue and request to change the interface a bit to help reduce confusion. In the app, there is a \"GET CASH\" button; this button should be changed to something like \"RETURN MONEY TO PARENT,\" or \"RETURN TO SENDER,\" and the paragraph within that button should read as: If you choose this option you will NOT add any money to your BusyKid Card but in fact give money back to your parents!This button is very confusing and shouldn't be on the main page; perhaps something found in Advanced or Accounts/Settings. This button is confusing to kids as it looks like this is the method to add cash to your Card but it is not. Yes, I know there is an approval process, but if you're not paying attention, parents will approve it without understanding the result, thinking it is just an extra layer of protection to move money to the card. The option to LOAD CARD is the correct method and should be the only thing they can use. Yes, I know you can Send a Bonus directly to the Card, but that is not how I teach them to use the card. We put money into their Spend Bucket, and they Transfer only what they need to the card at the time of purchase. This way, any fraud is minimized as they control what amount is available on the card at all times and no more, as you can't take back money from the card.The other issue is that I recently added my wife to the BusyKid App, and she added her own Funding Source. So last night she added $40 to my daughter's Spend bucket account, and then my daughter went out on her school trip, but she mistakenly used the GET CASH process and sent all the money back to my wife's funding source and she had nothing. The wife checked her debit card account and found nothing listed as credit. I checked my debit card account and found the missing money there, where it should not have been, since my debit card was NOT used to fund my daughter's account. I called and spoke with super friendly and helpful Lisa S, and she told me that BusyKid only credits back to the primary account holder's funding source and not where the funding came from if it is from another person's funding source. This makes no sense at all! Plus the credit amounts were not precise and were broken up into three separate amounts that have no correlation to match up to any transactions on any card accounts.I also asked Lisa which is the fastest way to get customer service, as leaving a phone message and waiting for a call back when there is an issue is sometimes frustrating waiting 3 to 4 hours. Lisa mentioned chatting, which is the method I will use when I need immediate support, and phone support when it is not an emergency. Thank you"

I would recommend Busy Kid to anyone who is looking for a simple, not complicated way to help their children with their homework, chores etc. If those things aren't completed, you run the risk of your card being declined due lack of funds. It is also great for grandparents to do what we like to do and give the grandchildren money. A+ and \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f"
