          "Contenu": "I had an absolutely dreadful experience with Ultahost.com, and I feel compelled to share my frustration. I signed up for their services with high hopes, but unfortunately, they delivered nothing but disappointment.Firstly, their service quality was abysmal. The website loading times were slow, and I frequently encountered downtime issues. This made it extremely difficult to run my online business effectively, leading to a loss of customers and revenue.To make matters worse, I reached out to their customer support multiple times to address these issues, but the response was painfully slow and unhelpful. It felt like I was talking to a wall, as my concerns were brushed off without any real solutions or explanations.As if this wasn't bad enough, when I finally decided I had enough and requested a refund, Ultahost.com proved to be just as disappointing in that aspect. They flat-out refused to process a refund, despite their clear failure to deliver the promised service.In the end, I wasted both my time and money on Ultahost.com, and I would strongly advise anyone considering their services to steer clear. They are unreliable, unresponsive, and have no regard for customer satisfaction. My experience has been nothing short of a nightmare, and I regret ever doing business with them."

Moving to one star now.I started using UltaHost a few days ago. I ordered a VPS from them. Well we started having issues running two very low end websites which the first VPS server should've handled with no issue. Both websites were lagging and the CPU was jumping to 100%. Support told me I needed more resources, I didn't think this was true but I went ahead and spent more money. BUT that didn't fix it either. I reached out to another host and we set up the same two sites on one of their VPS and it ran with no issues. Not even above 50% CPU. This new VPS has the same specs as the UltaHost server. I reached out to billing to request a refund. They refunded the first cost of the stage 1 VPS but they refuse to refund the cost of the upgrade which was $78. Per their terms, I get that. However support told me that I needed more resources which didn't help at all. This was recommended by staff. The gave me credit, which I won't use because their hardware is unstable.The support team was alright.I would recommend spending more money with another host so you don't have these issues."

          "Contenu": "In my many years of online business UltaHost is by far the worst web host I have ever dealt with. To start the live \u201csupport\u201d rep will blatantly lie to get you to sign up. After they migrated my websites literally nothing worked\u2026database, email and ssl. Based on the quick live chat I expected a quick fix but instead the support tickets were just ignored. Chasing it only got me templated responses and attitude. After my websites being down the whole day and nobody being willing to help I switched to a different web host. At least they offered a 30-day money back guarantee\u2026or so they advertised across their site. Turns out they have various clauses to deny refunds to 99% of clients. You\u2019d think their 99.99% uptime guarantee would cover me instead\u2026.nope another meaningless fraudulent \u201cguarantee\u201d. Now I am pursuing a chargeback with my credit card company. The following day they apparently got the hosting working acknowledging their mistakes in setting it up. Also despite multiple requests to cancel my account it is still active which I assume is another part of their scam. Stay far away from this web host. Complete incompetence and complete lack of ethics.UPDATE: Their claims about their refund policy are nonsense.  It is structured so that 99% of clients don't qualify, yet all over their website they brag about 30 day money back guarantee.  If a company is going to promote a certain benefit it needs to apply to more than a tiny percentage of people otherwise it is something they could get sued over.  I'll just get my money back via a credit card chargeback as these guys are crooks.Repeatedly Ultahost has tried to get this review removed by claiming I am not a legit customer.  Clearly this is a tactic they do hoping that people don't save their receipts."

          "Contenu": "They offer competitive pricing, but terribly confusing and predatory billing practices. I chose to close one of the hosting products with them (as many people do) and requested a refund within the 30-day initial period. They made the process insanely difficult and continued to invoice me for a Mac VPS that was cancelled. They took over $60 from my bank account and insisted upon issuing it as a credit for future use with them rather than reversing the erroneous charge. They respond with very long, clearly canned email responses that do not address your concern at all. I tried hard to make them understand the nature of this issue but they kept denying responsibility. Stay away from them if you do not like bureaucracy and shady billing practices. I see most of their responses to negative reviews are mean and trying to shame the customer for doing something wrong. This is clear evidence of a business that does not like to accept responsibility when it has done something wrong. However it's true what they say sometimes, you get what you pay for, and it's on me for choosing a not-so-reputable, small hosting provider.Edit: It looks like they have issued another canned response that is completely tone deaf to the original situation. First of all the cancellation request was made within 30-days of the original month refund timeline. Second, the complaint is regarding me being charged for months after cancelling said service with them."

I sincerely hope ULTA HOST takes this feedback seriously and works towards better customer communication, transparency, and improved service reliability.UPDATED:Team ULTAHOST knows that this is a genuine review and i'm using their services but they are flagging the review on trust pilot that the review is fake.

When I signed up I wanted to make sure the dedicated server was in the USA. They said it doesn't matter where the server is in the world. YES IT DOES! I'm in the USA and the server was in Germany. They never answered me as to where the server was. The dedicated server had issues with site load times of 25 seconds! It took a week for them to \"fix\" the issue, which was removing cpanel and replacing it with a free, cheaper-looking cpanel clone. That's not a fix. My site was down for a week. They offered to move the server to a USA server, at twice the cost, and what I wanted in the first place! Techs support only works through tickets via their site. Maybe it takes a few hours or a couple days to fix. When I had a question on server slowness, one of the techs responded by saying \"I'm talking crazy\" and \"My thoughts are not right.\" They are vain and I never felt comfortable asking questions. I was reminded by them how they are the best and their customer service shines. It doesn't. I cancelled after this 2 week disaster. They refuse to refund money for the server I used for only 2 weeks and paid a year for! They don't do refunds. They saw this review within an hour and threatened to take it down. They care more about their reputation online than supporting customers. I'd stay clear of ultahost. I never felt comfortable. They got paid a full year for 2 weeks of bad use. They said they will respond to this review with a copy of their policy, which says no refunds. They also said they will have my review removed. Any other hosting company would refund the difference for months not used. If you're ok with no refunds, slow tech support via ticketing system and vain remarks, this is the company for you."

I have encountered a serious issue of fraudulent activity running on their hosting, and my attempts to contact them for assistance have been met with utter disappointment. Their unresponsiveness and lack of support have left me frustrated and disillusioned.I initially reached out to UltaHost via email, hoping to alert them to the fraudulent activity taking place on their platform. However, despite multiple attempts, I did not receive a single response from their customer support team. It is deeply concerning that a company entrusted with the responsibility of hosting websites does not take immediate action when notified about fraudulent activities. Their negligence raises serious questions about their commitment to maintaining a secure and trustworthy hosting environment.In an attempt to seek a resolution, I also tried engaging with their live chat agents. Unfortunately, my interactions with them only added to my frustrations. Instead of providing meaningful assistance, the agents simply directed me to resend my emails repeatedly, leading to a never-ending loop of unproductive communication. It was disheartening to witness their inability or unwillingness to address my concerns and provide a satisfactory solution.As a customer, I expect a hosting company to prioritize the security and well-being of its users. UltaHost's failure to acknowledge and promptly address the fraudulent activity on their platform is a clear indication of their disregard for customer safety. The lack of attention given to serious issues and the dismissive behavior of their support staff demonstrate a severe lack of professionalism and commitment to customer satisfaction."

So now I have no service AND missing almost $100. They refuse to acknowledge error on their end and have closed my support tickets instead of refunding me my money.Update: Ultahost has finally figured things out and have begin processing my refund. I still need to get it. But right now I think they need a new payment protal. Whoever they use was the source of the problem, not ultahost. I am upping my rating to 4 stars."

My continual quest to boost my WordPress site's performance became redundant since UltaHost ensures pages load seamlessly.I'm particularly fond of their pick-and-choose method for add-ons, as it allows me to only pay for what I find necessary, saving me from wasting money on unneeded services. The platform is incredibly user-friendly; a simple login, a selection of the desired action or contact, and following the prompted options is all it takes. The transfer process was impressively swift, clocking in at just 3-4 hours, a stark contrast to the days I had expected it to take. Their customer service is top-notch, offering thorough explanations and help with complicated installations that are beyond my expertise.UltaHost has been a revelation for me. Its speed, intuitive interface, and stellar customer service have greatly enhanced my website's performance and my overall user experience. I strongly advocate for it to anyone seeking a dependable and effective hosting service."
