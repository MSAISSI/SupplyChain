After not receiving the desired resolution I uploaded my complaint to a reputable review agency and was met with a response that not only did not refund the necessary amount owed but had the gall to reply in a rude manner . I am still awaiting the final resolution  . I have asked for the refund and look forward in hopes that they will honor their policy. At the very least the customers concerns must be addressed in a professional way. Pt.2 : I will add this since I have been asked by the company to clarify. My ask was for a refund but instead I was met with a list of what ( in their opinion) I the customer had done wrong. The back in forth did not address my reason for contact (refund) .  After what I thought was an attempt at aimiable resolution I was met with the following final email. The Tone in all of the chats and emails was rude, sarcastic unprofessional, and deflective. I will never use this company again nor will I recommend them to anyone else. \"I'm very sorry that your experience was such that you found it necessary to contact the BBB to reach a resolution......Before we go any further, there are a couple of points in your email to the BBB that I would like to clarify...As far as the next steps, we should first have a discussion about your messaging practices.....I hope that you will retract your letter, as well as any similar comments you've made to other entities, with the understanding that we're willing to work with you to advise on best practices .....whether or not you spend another dime with us.\"Final Email:Hello V, If the only resolution you would find amicable is a refund for services we've rendered I'm afraid we can't do that."

I tried to use other functions on the website than just simply texting.  I was given little to zero guidance on how to set up a poll and run it correctly when asking the customer support.   Then when I called in after spending money and not having my poll run correctly for help was given a \"well sucks to be you attitude\"   The texting feature works.  But I will be looking for another company to work with as I feel I can get the simple texting features else where with a higher degree of customer support.  I did not require my money back. Just simply some guidance to use the features that their sales people call me about monthly."

We got all sorts of erroneous texts from outside areas without any understanding of why at that point.  We held an event where we printed a \"text to donate\" banner only to find out that it didn't work for any of the patrons that attended.  I spoke with their \"tech support\" said they couldn't verify why unless we had all of the potential new numbers that  the people used to text in.  Completely unhelpful.  I tried to get a refund and they claim their system cannot refund anything that was processed more than 24 hours ago, despite the fact that their service was a complete ripoff!  We are now almost a year into our campaign, have raised $0 and are actually out $225.  DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE!!!"

So when I was returning to work I wanted to find a way to reach out to all my customers without group text. This company seemed to have promise but after I paid them 400$ I quickly realized it wasn\u2019t going to work.nobody read the text considering the amount of fraud on our phones, my clients don\u2019t reconize the number they used so they were not ever opened. You don\u2019t use you business number. My clients mostly over the age of 60 they are just to cautious. When I tried calling I never got a return call only emails of how to fix the issue. I explained it would never be fixed because my clients would not open the text. I went and individually text my clients on my own it took a couple days but I had to use my number. Ez text claims you can cancel anytime that dosnt mean get you remaining money back. Nope they just keep it even thou they did nothing for you. Maybe if you are a huge retailer with a website you could get leads on it might be worth it then, but my one man business it would never be s\u00edtiale. So unless you have money to throw away, the amount of unprofessionalism and understanding of my situation is horrible. Don\u2019t waste your money there are plenty of other companies to use"

The state of Utah requires specific verbiage sent to patients 45 days prior to sending them to a collections agency. Again, we have been sending the exact same message for 2+ years and we recently received notice that they would be closing our account if we didn't stop the \"threatening messages\". I called customer service and I explained that it is a requirement of the state to include these supposedly \"threatening\" messages. They told me I would no longer be able to send these messages. So when I said we'd need to cancel our account then and asked to received a refund for our previous credit he said they don't issue refunds. So then I asked to speak to a supervisor and was placed on hold. Rep came back on and said again they can't issue a refund for the current credit, however if I purchase additional credits they can then refund those credits plus a small portion of my current credit. Why on earth would I have to purchase additional credits in order to receive a refund for credits I already purchased? There are other companies out there- don't waste your time with this one."
