          "Contenu": "Basic software. Very slow, and there are not a lot of features available. Customer service is bad; re-importing credit gives inaccurate results. Overall, this software is not good to use for credit repair businesses. I will not recommend this software. and the price per month is very high. It is not worth it. You will lose a lot of clients if you use this software. No notifications when stuff is due or past due; no good communication source with the software to communicate with your clients beside messaging. Not recommended."

          "Contenu": "Thus far not good because I have been held up for over a month, while paying for a service that is not benefiting me. An no one seems to really care.When onboarding the system would not let me move forward until I signed up with Credit Score Hero. My first red flag because I was force into the subcription to move forward.As I discovered using Credit Score Hero/Advantage scoring model is inaccurate, as it gave me a 103 point score difference than the FICO scoring model, that most all lenders use. Which I only found out when applying for a refinance on my home, and I learned auto lenders also use FICO.So I cancelled my subscription and signed up with IdentityIQ FICO option.Why Credit Score Hero would have Advantage as their only option makes no sense. Not logical to provide clients scores so much different than what a lender is going to pull. Only serves to upset people as it has me. That is not being a Hero!Yet CRC/CSH (Credit Score Hero) seems determined to make us use Advantage scoring model by making errors pop up when trying to use affiliate links?I can't import my own credit report, much less a client. I have tried 2 different affiliates that use FICO with same error.  So why should I be paying for a service I can't use accurately?Bella in your very slow customer support system says my log in credentials are wrong causing the problem. 1. Your site does not ask for the affiliates login credentials. 2. I provided Bella my log in credentials and same problem and no further response.Seems your company is determined on making people use Credit Score Hero. To what end? It has to be upsetting a lot of customers once they apply for financing and find out their score is actually much lower. Which is bad for the industry's reputation. Credit Repair Cloud seems to have a great platform for processing yet I can't get there to actually find out. CRC seems uninterested in allowing affiliate links to work. The CRC/CSH site even highly discourages using affiliates.I just don't get how CRC/CSH benefits long term.Short of whom ever is reading this being able to resolve my issue very soon, I will be shopping for another platform to process my 20 plus waiting list of clients waiting for me to get started."

Your sidestepping and clear desire to avoid the question is concerning!There is still no clear answer here regarding the business model being promoted in your ads and on social media which is clearly designed to promote collecting fees immediately from clients upon signing them up for services.Simple Question: Do you promote Credit Repair Businesses collecting fees for services on an ongoing monthly basis?Simple Question: You clearly recommend that your trainees (customers) use \"Billsby payment solution\" for taking credit card payments because as you state \"PayPal, Stripe, and other common gateways cannot be used to receive credit repair payments or ACH Transfers for credit repair\" - WHY do these payments services not allow collection of payments for \"credit repair\"?FINALLY: These are valid questions that you as a company promoting this business model should be readily able and prepared to answer.**\ud835\udc14\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc04 \ud835\udc00\ud835\udc05\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc11 \ud835\udc02\ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc0d\ud835\udc18 \ud835\udc11\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc12\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc0d\ud835\udc12\ud835\udc04**The response below completely sidesteps the issues in my review\ud835\uddd9\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddff\ud835\ude00\ud835\ude01 & \ud835\uddd9\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfa\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude00\ud835\ude01This company deleted my question on its Facebook page and blocked me from commenting - WHY? was it to hide the Federal Law Question?NOTE: In their answer below they clearly place the responsibility upon any using their system to comply with the law\ud835\udc12\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1dThe company does not answer the question about the Violation of Federal law under the Credit Repair Organizations Act which prevents the collection of up front fees which Credit Repair Cloud PROMOTES\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1dThey have no telephone contact number and did not provide one in response to my review because they can't!--------------------------------------------------------\ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25 \ud835\udc11\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc30Looking for answers. The company has no telephone number so everything is through electronic communication. When I attempted to get answers on their social media platform they blocked me from commenting which basically provided me with my answer. Here's the question that the company wouldn't answer.In researching this opportunity I came across the Credit Repair Organizations Act (Federal Law). The Act bars companies offering credit repair services from demanding advance payment.How does this affect this business model?How do you structure a credit repair business that creates revenue and complies with the law?"

          "Contenu": "I was very excited to enroll and even paid for their 14 day challenge. I was moving over from another service that has not aged gracefully and didn't have the bells and whistles of CRC.All started out great and they do a wonderful job of providing some of the basic training from within the 14 day challenge which will take up 2-3 weeks of your 30 day trial.If you are starting out with no clients the onboarding and doing your first client doesn't seem that bad. However if you have been in the business for any time at all and are wanting to move clients over they don't really train on that.I had questions, lot of questions..How do I bring my existing 200+ clients over manually?What happens if a client doesn't want to use one of the preferred monitoring services? How are files entered manually without disrupting existing clients with \"thanks for signing up emails\"?What happens and how do you handle future rounds?Can you send out different letters based on the results, if so how?I had these and lots of other questions. The only way to get answers was to email them. No chat support, extremely limited phone support. For me to get all my questions answered would probably take a month and I'll explain why below.I asked if i could talk to someone live as I just had too many questions. They said sure but each call would be limited to 15 minutes. I couldn't imagine I would be limited to 15 minutes \"for real\" so i made the appt.Call was scheduled for the next day at 1:00pm, I was waiting and didn't receive a call. I got a call at 1:10 and answered it and it wasn't them (it was a prospect) While i was talking they called about 1:20 I called back moments later and was told to reschedule the appt.I was upset as it was the caller that was late. I tried to complain via email and all they could do is apologize and setup another meeting a couple days later.I then knew that the 15 minutes was a hard 15 minutes and wanted to complain further and plead my case for more time.I emailed and even posted in the facebook group. The email was responded to within 24 hours with a form letter apologizing and offering the 15 minutesMy facebook post was quickly deleted with the reason that support questions are to be sent to support and not to the facebook group. Before the post was removed I received messages from several people saying the software was good but the service was terrible, 2 of which recommended going elsewhere before I got too deep.Prior to enrolling I did read reviews and most were very good and I used them to help guide my decision. I later found out that most of the reviews were probably incentivized as when I finished the 14 day challenge I was offered the following.Give us a review and the best review will get 1 free month of service ($179 value) and even if you are not the best review you will get a $49 credit. At the time I gave them a good review because I liked the promise of the software but had to rescind and replace once i knew the truthI now know why they got so many good reviews. I did stop everything and moved on to a different service that had all the same bells and whistles and after 2 weeks have experienced overwhelming customer service from the new company. and they are actually cheaperI think this company puts on a show during the trial period with just enough to get new people started knowing that moving and learning a new tool is very difficult. They probably push their training that includes 6 months of software to get you embedded even longer.I would say to stay away from this company if you want to be in the credit repair business long term, especially if you are a new business.BTW - I've been in the business full time for over 13 years and will be in it many more."

          "Contenu": "I signed up with incredible excitement. This company is legit with outstanding reviews. Upon signing up, they talk heavily about such a seamless process and their tech-support is always available and unfortunately that is not a fact and as of this writing I have yet to be helped appropriately I had software issues in the beginning I graduated yesterday I went to move into the master class when I went to buy the material  message pops up saying email address did not exist. My new business email which supposedly was changed did not exist nor did the email that I originally signed up with within their system exist . I called again and left a detailed voice message and instead of getting a return phone call I get a text message telling me the complete opposite of what the tech that told me before who supposedly changed my business address as primary . One of the technicians did not even know how to get around this software for this particular program, let alone help me with my issues. And within that same phone call expressing that I can\u2019t purchase materials the tech didn\u2019t even address that. I feel like most of their tech-support flippantly respond back and just shoot off a email without reading or comprehending the true nature of the problem with half the time in my situation required a telephone call. It has been an absolute nightmare. My question has been. What do they expect me to do with continuous ongoing issues that I have no control over it is coming from their side and there\u2019s no human to talk to  no supervisor to request but yet I\u2019m trying to build a business with this very company. In the Facebook group that you are participating in when you enroll I was called out on some of the life coaching calls because I was posting my issues asking for help and the only way I got help was posting them in the Facebook group and was called out for that. Not one of the administrators in my Facebook group even attempted to help Not in any way shape or form. Nobody did nothing still putting out there that I\u2019m having these issues and have been ignored, and the one technician who shot back with an email that didn\u2019t even resolve my issue. I am not seeing or feeling the level of support that I\u2019ve heard when I first enrolled and went through this training. Their level of support is talked about repeatedly yet they don\u2019t disclose it\u2019s only done by texting and that does not always work and the fact that I cannot reach a human is beyond frustrating. At this point I am not heard and my issues are not being resolved. More issues are coming through and it\u2019s not due to me. It\u2019s due to their technicians whatever they\u2019re not doing right is completely causing a huge ripple and my inability to move forward and practice what I just paid for within this course"

Even after you make a dispute on the same issue no one will call you they keep sending you different links or videos to try to figure it out. You also do not get a mentor you have to depend on the Facebook group for guidance.

With so much jumping from section to section it became very difficult to understand where I was at sometimes. I was so confused that I fell behind ( due to frustration ) but I caught back up after I figured things out. On the other hand, the staff did a VERY good job at keeping me motivated and confident throughout the whole process. They actually made me believe I can get this done and I am determined to get it done. The motivational aspect of the program is very important. The best part of the program is when they actually started teaching you about the software, by going through the steps on screen. They made THAT part very simple to understand, and I am confident I can use it without guidance. I gave it 3 stars  not because I think the program is bad, but because it can use some improvements in the way they teach it.

If you import credit reports through IdentityIQ or the other companies they recommend, be aware that the dispute letters that you generate will not list the name of the collection company furnishing the data.  Instead, they'll list the original creditor (hospital, doctor's office etc).  After waiting 5 days for an answer on this from customer support, I was told that the only way to work around that is to manually change the letters, which completely defeats the purpose of speeding up the dispute letter creation.Poor customer service."

I only gave it 3 stars instead of 5 because i wish they were a bit more user friendly and I also wish they would not have double charged me for 4 months by calling me and telling me my credit card on file needed updated. I told them it should be on auto-pay and they said my card didn't go through so maybe it is expired or something. In efforts to avoid my account being shut off and losing all my current clients, I hurriedly gave them a new card. Come to find out, this opened a new account for me and I was being charged on both accounts now. When I called and explained the situation, they said, sorry, you only have 30 days to dispute a charge and since its been so long (4 months before I noticed) we will not refund the entire 4 months. I explained that They could see that I was not processing clients through the secondary account and had been plenty busy on the original account and that should prove that it was not opened purposefully. They have stuck with the fact that I didn't let them know within 30 days so I was stuck paying it. They agreed to refund 2 months of the fees. I'm still waiting for a call back from a higher up. Higher than the supervisor."

After all, although we are in this to help others out in every way that we can, we cannot continue to support ourselves if our business is not making a living profit. I was also not happy with belief week. While I get it that some people need the help to believe in themselves, I do not think it needed a full week. I almost asked for a refund after the 2nd day because it felt like an MLM seminar and I am not looking to join one. I am very glad that I didn't ask for one now that I have finished the course. Although the Referal Program was mentioned for the Credit Hero Challenge, I feel that more time could have been put into the training side of this. It would have been a great way to create income as people went thru the 14 day challenge. If belief week started as a day or two and then transitioned into teaching how to market the course as a way to \"earn while you learn\" over the next 14 days, I believe it would have been a 5 Star course. Finally, I wish that more time would have been spent in setting up the payment side of the software. It seemed that in the Software certification course it showed Billsby and then breezed on past how to actually set up and what the process needed to be to get approved for a merchant account and then the a billing account."

It is user friendly and easy to navigate through. The training videos are clear and concise. The 14 day challenge was comprehensive and very informative. It helped boost my confidence in being able to start a credit repair business. I enjoyed the FB group too because I was able to see all the issues people were having and see the answers to some of my own questions. I am excited to embark on my credit repair business journey and I pray this the journey God has led me too. I believe I have what it takes to be apart of the millionaire club. I am excited for the opportunity to hopefully join the master class. And really step up my knowledge of the credit repair world. Thank you for this training and opportunity to expand my knowledge in credit repair and making a software that works not just for me on the backend, but my potential clients."

I have worked on my own credit these past 2 years going from 609 to 728 as of today, but if I knew then what I know now it may have been less than 2 years, but it is what it is. The CRC software is excellent and easy to navigate, but most of all makes the whole process move smoothly. The additional books, and PDFs that were given are vital to success, with a lot of useful text, information, do's and dont's, all covering each step of the process. The only issue I see is human error when entering information but that is fixable. The course work was repetitive at times but essential to understand how to do credit repair and be successful. I would recommend others take this Challenge even if it is only to fix their credit problems. For me, 5 Stars it has everything I need to move forward."

I have been experiencing financial hardships since my accident in 3/16/2023 when an Amazon driver struck me being the passenger and things are so backed up and hard trying to make ends meet. I feel as if Anwulika Opone didn\u2019t understand nor did she addressed my original concerns at all, which was me not having the $179 to begin with and she kept pushing the fact to pay the 179 and be discounted half the following month if I had the full 179 I would\u2019ve paid it so that didn\u2019t help at all but Vida instead granted me my original invoice $107 because of Credit added, that was discounted before the expiration took place which was more manageable to pay versus the original $179 . That\u2019s why I would like to take the time to leave this review just to tell Vida thank you so much for understanding my concern and going out your way to addressing provide a solution and such desperate trying times when you still want to operate and do right by your customers . Thank you soooo much vida for your help. !! Things will not continue to be the same it will get better and I\u2019ll be able to manage my payments more responsibly!!! Thank you again CRC !! :)"
