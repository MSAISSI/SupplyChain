Auto generated templates. Ideal for people who are hands on and want to know exactly what is happening with the dispute themselves. Takes several rounds to delete dispute but you have total control over it because you are the one who handle mailing letters. The templates are of perfect native English so they are good qualities. They even refunded me immediately when I wanted to quit! Five star trustworthy customer service."

Can\u2019t thank DisputeBee enough \ud83d\ude4f I\u2019m so happy and thankful I\u2019ve been able to secure 25k credit cards limits and endless low % rates for my new car loans. Saving me thousands - I feel free each month paying low payments because I have a low interest rate. Im able to pay more into my loans and this is reflecting on my credit as well. The program is super simple to use and after a few rounds of letters you\u2019ll see things fall off. It\u2019s amazing and some are persistent and I\u2019m still working on some but only have 5 negative accounts left, out of 38 negative accounts. Seems like a lot but my credit was a mess before and now I\u2019m understanding the ripple effect of just one late payment. And then an entire account closed out adds even more to those late payments now you have collections after that so my sitch was pretty messy. All and all I will say the price for the program and then the add on with the credit report is worth it. I was able to see my score increase and I controlled how fast I wanted to get my score repaired. Total time I\u2019ve spent using the program is about 9 months. I\u2019m thankful now I can have the score I wanted after all the mess I\u2019ve been through. Thank you DisputeBee"
