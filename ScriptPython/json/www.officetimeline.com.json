          "Contenu": "Why have a free version?  If one wanted to determine whether this is the program they wanted they would want to test the actual capabilities of the program.  If the free version doesn't allow one to alter a timeline in any way they wouldn't already be able to do so in Powerpoint or Excel, then how is one able to accurately assess whether they should be 100 bucks to use the service.  In short, I'm sure its a fine service... but if they want to offer a free test version, perhaps it should have ANY features that can tell one if it is useful.  If they do not want to offer a free test version, fine.  They can rely on their brand name.  But, they should not do an in-between version where they pretend to offer a free test that does not at all test the service (because you cannot do anything at all to edit a timeline--the whole point of the service).In any event, I'm sure they have plenty of corporate accounts and need not concern themselves with small-timers who would like to assure the product works for them before blowing a hundred dollars per subscription.In sum, waste of time if you are not absolutely sure before testing the product that this is absolutely what you need (I am positive they allow their corporate clients to test it before committing)."

Import wizard is not intuitive and does not recognize columns like Start Time and End Time; 4. changes to settings made during the import wizard are not reflected unless you close PowerPoint and reopen, etc.  I\u2019ve also experienced freezes in this area as well. I\u2019m using a ssd i5 HP so this should not be behaving this way.  5. Looking at their support section of their web site, it's very limited and no avenue to report bugs or issues.  *Just found the support email buried on the Contact Us page and not on the Support page. 6. This product, while a great concept, has proven to be unstable and offers little support for the many issues I\u2019ve experienced.  Using this application has been extremely frustrating and a waste of time and money!  This is completely unacceptable!  I would NOT recommend Office Timeline for professional or personal use."

          "Contenu": "Updated Review June 13Upon giving my honest opinion of the Office Timeline software, an email conversation was had where I gave more details about my experience with the software. I rated the software a 3 as it was functional but not mind blowing. After this email conversation I received a separate email notifying me of a canceled subscription and refund. I did not ask for this, as I stated, the software is functional and I purchased it to have said functionality. If they were willing to offer a refund to an unhappy customer, fine, offer me that option, but don't unilaterally make a decision without talking to me, the customer. My opinion of the customer service team and or customer policy's are a negative 5 stars, but that is not an option in this rating system.Original Review: While functional, I was surprised by how limited the options were once downloading the full version of Office Timeline. Not sure I think it's worth the money. The software also seems to try to outsmart the user and change things in one area when you only want them changed in another area. I know what I'm doing, I don't need the software to try to 'correct' me. Bottom line, gets the job done, but if you plan to use this for a variety of things, you will probably find the lack of templates and options very limiting."

          "Contenu": "Office Timeline is generally a good and useful software. Nevertheless, I don't recommend it. What I don't like at all is its pricing model. In my opinion it's brazen. I can't understand, why such a relatively small Office-add-on, which is only used from time to time, shall cost nearly as much as the main program \u2013 and, on top of it, it's only offered as a subscription model. (The offered Freemium model is bit of a joke. It's limited to just ten items, which is far too little to make something useful).The pricey subscription model is a deal breaker for me. I don't see how the (time-)cost that one may save with this software, which is only used from time to time, could justify the high expenses. In terms of usability, I also see potential for improvement. It would be nice to consider general settings - also for date formats. Having to change the date format again and again is not fun. Same thing for removing the dates. It has to be done separately through a rather cumbersome menu structure, which takes too much time due to the many clicks.Also, creating bigger, more complex timelines (to be copied into Word reports) in Power-Point with the Office Timeline Add-on, can be quite a mission. Especially, if the Power Point slide is smaller than the timeline. As a consequence, Power Point sometimes switches unintentionally and annoyingly to the next slide. The only way out is to reduce the picture size in order to see the whole (Power Point-)picture. But then everything is so small that it is difficult to recognize something, let alone work efficiently."

If you make a manual change, that's even worse because if you then, for example, edit the timelime after making a manual change, the whole thing reverts back to the template's default making you lose all edits made. 2.\tIt's not easy to move task bars up and down and keep them that way. It would be nice if at least it could behave similarly to the SmartArts feature, where you can at least convert it to text or shapes and go on to make manual changes. 3.\tThe other thing that doesn't work well if you import a list of tasks and dates. It doesn't do anything close to what it should be and it always turns out it's more efficient to enter dates manually and individually. Which ends up taking too much time. 4.\tAlso, if I delete a timeline bar, for example, once I make any other update, the timeline comes back. In essence, the button called \"Accept Changes\" simply doesn't work... Ever. If I like a specific template, there's no way I can move a timeline from the bottom to the top. 5.\tIf I change the colors of the task bars, again, once I edit tasks, the original colors come back\u20266.\tUnder the \"New\" button, I don't see the point of having the 2 options (\"new timeline\" and \"templates\") if both behave the same. The same goes for the \"import\" option that appears twice but do the same thing. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I actually do use some of it. I like the concept for Office Timeline Pro, but it just didn't deliver for me. It's definitely NOT worth the cost because it has way too much improvement to be made overall. The items listed above have a big negative impact on the experience of the tool for the users. When I purchased it, I was under the impression it was far more efficient, but there were times when I was in a hurry that it was much faster to create something complete manually using shapes and texts instead of using this expensive tool. Will definitely not purchase again nor would recommend."

I did find a work around and added some text boxes for the years that were missing but they have to go on at the very end as they will disappear.\u2022\tWhen exporting,  the duration shows in days..  my project spans over 15 years, so it would be better if the default duration could be changed from days to months or even years.\u2022\tWould be nice to be able to connect two tasks that are in different swim lanes, I know you can do this if all the text is all the way to the left\u2026.  But why not be able to do this regardless of where the text is.Of course these are just improvement suggestions and I am overall pleased with the software capabilities."

It comes with some terrific pre-formatted timelines, however, I noticed that the online version has different ones that I wish you could access without having to pay for another subscription.  If anything since both require separate subscriptions at leat give them both access to the same default timelines."

When I need a timeline, a Gantt chart, or a roadmap to make the information easily digestible to everyone, this is the perfect tool to do any of them. The roadmaps and timelines are clear and crisp, looking stunning at the same time. I particularly like the swimlanes, that help group the information in a relevant way, and the drag-and-drop functionality that makes all the work really simple and intuitive. Also, data import and the copy-paste feature save me a lot of time when it comes to getting my data into the timeline. Not to mention the load of templates that come with the add-in. I particularly find templates helpful because sometimes I'm just not inspired on how I want my timeline to look, so I find a lot of ideas there. Plus, I don't have to work hard to build something from scratch. Many times, for me it's just 2-3 clicks to customize, wham-bam, ready to go! Thank you, Office Timeline!"

          "Contenu": "I have been using the software for about 30 days and I really like it.  It is giving me really sharp looking graphs/charts that I can use in PPT, or I have exported these images to use in my academic scientific papers as figures in Word docs.  The two challenges I have is 1) sometimes the file saving aspect does not work and without notice the file converts back to some earlier version.  I have followed the suggested ideas but this is just very challenging when working toward deadlines.  I SAVE my file and start a new one each day so I have the previous days work saved to convert back to.  I do this with Word files for my academic writing so I am used to that but for a software to corrupt itself like this - its a challenge.  2) For sizing we are stuck using PPT sizing formats; I know how to set this up for posters etc for academic research but resizing for different outputs using this software is also challenging.  Not everything I do with a schedule is for PPT presentation.  I tried to just do an 8.5 x 11 paper size and again it didn't like it and reverted my file back to some earlier version.  In fairness to Office Timeline they may have some workarounds for these that I have not fully explored but I am a power user of Office PPT and these things should just not happen IMO.  I am still giving it 5 stars in-spite of this feedback so that should tell you something as well.  I do recommend it, yet be prepared for some modest learning curves.  Good luck!"
