          "Contenu": "Issuu is a UK based publisher of flipbooks, turning PDFs into readable files. So, they're kind of the Youtube of publications. Only thing, they charge ridiculous fees to host your content, unlike Youtube which is free. Issuu USED to a great service, which allowed for small publishers to host their publications, without the severe limits it no imposes without paying ridiculous fees. The free edition of Issu now allows a mere 5 files to be hosted, and limits the number of pages. Which essentially makes it useless unless you pay their ridiculous fees. I would advice anyone feeling equal disappointment with Issuu to look into embedding PDFs directly to their website, using Wordpress plugins. Issuu has made itself a greedy platform, that is becoming irrelevant as tech advances."

          "Contenu": "Their customer service was nearly impossible to reach, and they charged me $1500 in recurring charges after I'd asked them to cancel. The package I bought years ago was not as promised - they continuously showed ads when they promised the package didn't have ads, etc. etc. Unfortunately, the transactions were direct debited through paypal, so I can't get the money back. Issuu cost me a lot of money and even more hassle. Do whatever you want to do on another program.UPDATE: Issuu commented here below as an attempt to clear their name, They sent me to a useless page, with no actual ability to talk to someone on their support team. A good company would simply leave a number I could call to get a human. This company is a total sham offering a defunct, useless product and making tons from ad money."

I wish I knew that. So if people do use your company they should be warned there is no option but to auto renew or remember to cancel a month in advance, unless you have something else in your terms that says you have certain days to cancel before the next term. It sucks that you are so unethical. If you believed in your product, you would give customers the option to renew or not, you would advise them ahead of time that their contract is up for the year. etc.  So I will share my experience and my frustration. I calendared my cancellation a month before the auto renew, do you want to share with me now if you have some other info in your terms that would prohibit this?"

          "Contenu": "Hi, on January 2nd I was charged 650 CAD for a subscription that I clearly remember downgrading. I signed up for ISSUU's free trial mid December 2019 (which is by default their most expensive premium plan) and after checking out the site immediately downgraded. Unfortunately I had given the system my payment details and it appears that the downgrade hadn't applied properly. ISSUU's website states that refunds can be granted within 30 days of the payment. I do expect a full refund as this is a website that I have found to be very convoluted in its sign up process and is one that I have no use for professionally and merely wanted to explore. I am a student who works part time and absolutely cannot afford such a subscription. I have already submitted two tickets to ISSUU's support system and have yet to hear back. After discovering that I am far from alone in this type of situation with the company I do hope they will make an effort to improve their communication with customers as their reputation is at stake, and do expect that this issue be resolved and a full refund granted."

Recently, I was contacted by one of their representatives who suggested I consider upgrading to Premium service. The payment plan seemed rather suspicious and circumspect, so I declined. However, I still uploaded documents to my site. I discovered that this company has taken a manuscript I uploaded almost two years ago, and is selling it for $14.15 per page, WITHOUT MY CONSENT. When I told these Orwellians to terminate my account, they created a new account, WITHOUT MY CONSENT, and added four publications that I deleted! I deleted all of my publications so the crooks would not be able to sell my works illegally WITHOUT MY CONSENT. When you visit the portal to delete the account, the page is inoperable. When you ask them to delete the account, they refuse. Therefore, these bums better pay back every cent they sold my manuscript for. STAY AWAY FROM THESE CROOKED THUGS."

You would think with the competition out here as well as a string of bad reviews they would work to improve their customer satisfaction index and quality rating but I guess not. Over the past few years I had referred several clients to them but will not be using them or referring them moving forward. I signed up for one of their subscription packages on behalf of a client who I later found out has a solution in place they were using. On the SAME day I was billed I reached out to issuu per their policy on refunds and notified them that the services were unused and not needed. I also cancelled subscription services to make sure it wouldnt appear we were attempting to use the service otherwise. It took  ten days for me to even get a response first off, and that they wouldnt be offering a refund along with a 'sorry about that' with no explanation or even an offer of credit for future purchases, nothing. I moved forward with a claim using my fulfillment channels so they will be dealing with it one way or another. If this is how you treat customers, you will be out of business if you continue this way."

          "Contenu": "I recently had an experience with Issuu that I feel compelled to share. Initially attracted by the platform's promising integration with Adobe InDesign, I was looking forward to exploring its features. However, my enthusiasm waned as I found the tools underwhelming, the APIs non-functional, and the pricing higher compared to other software options.Consequently, I decided to downgrade to the free plan. Unfortunately, this is where my challenges began. Despite my immediate action to cancel the subscription on the same day of creation, I faced difficulties in obtaining a confirmation of the cancellation and a refund. The response from Issuu's support team was prompt but strictly adhered to their policy: no refunds for monthly subscriptions.While I understand the importance of company policies, the lack of flexibility, especially considering the immediate cancellation, was disappointing. The situation escalated to the point where I had to initiate a chargeback through my credit card company, which thankfully resolved in my favor.On a positive note, Issuu\u2019s communication was clear and their response times were quick. However, the rigidity of their refund policy and the ensuing hassle left a sour taste.To potential Issuu customers, I'd advise being very certain about your need for the service before subscribing, as their refund policy is stringent, particularly for monthly plans. My experience serves as a reminder that while digital tools can be beneficial, the customer service aspect plays a crucial role in the overall satisfaction with a service."

From its sleek and user-friendly interface to the wealth of valuable content, this website has truly impressed me.First and foremost, the design is modern and intuitive. Navigating through the various sections was a breeze, and I never felt lost or overwhelmed. The layout adapts perfectly to both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a seamless experience regardless of the platform you're using.The content itself is where [Website Name] shines the brightest. Whether you're a novice or an expert in the subject matter, you'll find something of value here. The articles are well-researched, informative, and presented in a way that's easy to digest. I particularly appreciate the way complex topics are broken down into manageable chunks without sacrificing depth.But what truly sets this website apart is its community aspect. The comment sections foster engaging discussions among users who share similar interests. It's refreshing to see a platform that encourages thoughtful conversations rather than mindless trolling.Additionally, the regular updates keep the content fresh and relevant. I've already learned so much from this website, and I'm excited to see what they'll bring in the future.The only minor improvement I could suggest is to include more multimedia elements such as videos or interactive graphics to complement the written content. However, this is merely a suggestion and doesn't detract from the overall exceptional experience.In conclusion, [Website Name] is a gem for anyone looking to expand their knowledge, engage with a like-minded community, and do so in a visually appealing virtual environment. It has quickly become my go-to resource, and I can't recommend it enough. Kudos to the team behind this outstanding website!"
