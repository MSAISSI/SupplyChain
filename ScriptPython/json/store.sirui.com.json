          "Titre": "Sirui 33mm AF Lens (Z-Mount)",
          "Contenu": "I just received my 33mm auto focus lens today.  I installed in to my Nikon Z7 II.  In general, it gets along with my Z7 II.  However, autofocus doesn't work properly all the time and occasionally it struggles to find the focus even though I used single point focus!  My Nikon lenses don't do that.One thing I noticed though, the information on the pictures read by iPhone shown 49mm instead of 33mm!  In my camera, it read 33mm!  Something weird! Also, if I set my camera to full auto mode, the lens settled at F2.8 only.  It won't go to F1.2 nor any other F-stop!  This is kind of interesting.  I could change it to F1.2 only if I use Aperture priority!Overall, the lens is well built and it does a decent job for close up pictures.  Auto focus needs some works for sure!  But for this price point, I can't complaint too much!"
