I am never sure who will end up getting the lease first until I click send, then often times I have to cancel and resend to adjust who will get it first. Clarifying this and being able to adjust before sending would be fantastic. Thanks for a great product!Phil"

My tenants set up auto pay so it goes straight to LR. I do have to wait a good 6 days for funds. I like that I can set up if I want to pay the $5 fee or the tenant. It is good to be able to set up credit, eviction and criminal checks in one place. Again, you select who pays fees. My house payment is due the first and I would have set up rent due earlier if I had realized it takes 6 days to clear. Not a big deal because I have funds to cover. I could see where this would be very handy with multiple properties. I am a part of the landlords association for MT so we use our own forms. I am assuming the ones they have available would be fine. I simply send the payment link and LR does all the rest. My tenant was happy to pay the $5 a month for convince."
