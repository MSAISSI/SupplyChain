          "Contenu": "It is a horrible Platform with rude, irresponsible, cynical customer service and dimwitted buyers. I sold my GPU online using Jawa to this dumb customer who installed it into a low-profile machine, thus destroying my card. He then claimed that my card was broken and wanted a refund. He got what he wanted and returned my GPU in a disastrous state, as if it\u2019s been ridden over by a car. The GPU was returned using a mailer bag! Not even a box. Jawa refused to compensate me in any way even though I had paid for the shipping materials and the cost of shipping and return. To avoid responsibilities, they even claim that if you do not buy the shipping labels from them, they don\u2019t assist you with anything. Then how dare you charge us a fee for the sales? Clearly, Jawa is not interested in the welfare of the buyer and is only interested in sucking a significant percentage of your sales. They will side with the buyer, even if they are insolent fools who will destroy your GPU because they did not understand their computer compatibility with the card. Please don\u2019t sell your precious GPU or computer parts here because the buyer will destroy them, and Jawa will side with them."

          "Contenu": "I created a account and listed a few dozen items, even applied to be a verified seller. Sold two things in three months. I never caused a single problem, never got a single warning or strike on my account. I even asked customer support for help with what I could do better with my business. Next thing I know I get a email today saying my account has been suspended and deleted because apparently there was a link to a phishing website on my business profile. I was extremely shocked by this. Why would I do or want that when I\u2019m trying to grow a successful business? Well I asked jawa the same question but they didnt seem to care. I asked for proof of what there talking about but they just ignore my question. I plead that I had no knowledge or intentions of putting nefarious links on my business, but they didn\u2019t care. In fact it seems to more you talk to them the worse it gets for you somehow. A hour latter they claim to find even more evidence \u201csuddenly\u201d when they \u201crandomly\u201d audit  my account. They said they reverse image searched my item pictures and found them on the internet. WOW amazing discovery Jawa it\u2019s like I don\u2019t have my same items with the same pictures listed on Facebook and eBay to sell, absolutely crazy. Next Jawa customer service further looking for evidence proving their case, says I have another variation of my account and how I don\u2019t have original photos of high priced items. I tell them I only ever had my one account and that if they have any doubt I have legit ownership of my items I am happy to send them photos and receipts of everything immediately, but no they just ignore anything I say. Have I displayed any ill intent toward buyers or the community? Not at all. They wouldn\u2019t work with me all, \u201cI\u2019ll go on a temporary account probation till I earn your trust back after several months\u201d Nope they simply do not care and are not interested. Every time you answer a question from them they ask two more in it\u2019s place painting the user as the enemy, all the while ignoring every question you have. I highly recommend caution when dealing with Jawa apparently they think they are the CIA and will scrub the internet to prove a view against you. Just posted this review and immediately got a response from Jawa about it, and you guessed it used my review it as further reason for there case against me. Apparently guilty until proven innocent is there motive. Just delete someones passion without so much as single word with them, apparently is the right way to go with them. Eventually I had enough of their 20 questions games, and refused to answer any more of there questions till they answered my questions. This was there response. \u201cYou can avoid answering all you want, until you answer the important questions you will not be allowed to sell on the platform.\u201d You would think ohh this sounds like if you keep answering question from them you will get your account back, WRONG. I answer even more questions from them about my identity, I\u2019m not afraid of them I have nothing to hide. I\u2019m willing to send them my full ID, pictures of me with my items, what ever they want, just give me my account that I spent countless hours building. I don\u2019t even care anymore about selling on jawa I just want to see my account. I eventually ask \u201cwill I get account back since I answered so many of your questions\u201d, there response \u201c[no you] will not be able to give you your account back for the aforementioned reasons\u201c I asked them why they even asked all these questions from me from the start when it obvious they never had intention to help or restore my account. No answer from them of course. I can only guess to waste my time or milk more data from me to do god knows with. In the end they\u2019ll waste hours of your time playing 20 questions games to build a case against you without the remote intention of helping you out or being understanding. \u201cYour not building a case for self\u201d - Jawa Ryan Boyette Customer Service ManagerHello Amanda, I am more than forthcoming answering any questions related to my account and identity. I have absolutely nothing to hide and willing to do anything you ask. I have answered dozens and dozens of questions. Nothing happens, my accounts remains suspended with no proof of evidence when I ask for it. 1. More than willing to provide invoices and pictures of items you say I don\u2019t  legitimately own. 2. More than willing to provide to a DD214 or copy of ID to prove identification. 3. I immediately asked for proof and removal of this link \u201cfound in multiple places\u201d on my account as soon as I was told about it, yet provided 0 evidence of this being true."

          "Contenu": "Here's an authentic review for Jawa as a selling & buying platform. Its a great way to sell your PC parts and other peripherals as well to buy/flip. A lot of people are helpful in the discord server that I advise you to join. Here's my main issue with Jawa. Jawa does its best to hear from both sides when there is a dispute about an item but in doing so, it was pointed out by someone else that the platform is buyer centric. As a seller, this worries me. On their support page, it states, \"You have 48 hours from time item was reported as delivered to inspect and test your purchase\" for the buyer. If a dispute is opened after 48 hours, the money can still be pulled from the Stripe account once the seller has received an email about getting paid from Jawa. This concerns me because its showing that even after 48 hours, you're not guaranteed your money. If I could give this 4.5 stars I would because that seems fair in my opinion. Other than that, I do hope Jawa does implement some sort of change to their dispute system. Do not let what I say interfere with your decision upon selling your items on the platform. Seller fees are somewhat higher than I would like them to be but there's a good reason for that. I will continue to use Jawa because I love the platform and the people in the server are great!"

The platform has improved a lot since I first came on board and the staff seem to have a good head on their shoulders and are quite fair. I personally haven't had any issues with sales or purchases on the platform. The big plus is that they integrated Affirm to their platform allowing more people that don't have the cash up front to be able to make payments which is a huge plus."
