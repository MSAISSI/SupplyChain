          "Contenu": "I've had a deeply unsettling experience with this application. Despite clear terms, I was charged an amount surpassing what was agreed upon. When trying to address the issue, it seemed like the support system is designed to deflect rather than assist. While I eventually reached a higher-level manager, the ordeal shed light on potentially deceptive billing practices that I believe are aimed at extracting more money from users. For small businesses, like mine, trust is paramount. It's disappointing to see corporations resort to such tactics. Users deserve transparency and respect, especially when it comes to billing. I'd advise potential users to be wary."

Meanwhile, I have to suffer a currency conversion charge from my bank due to their technical fault and they refused to cover the lossNow I do not want to continue this service and want a refund remaining amount of 2 months.They denied it and told me it was not possible. they did not clarify it when I was subscribing. they are forcing me to consume balance by using their service.and the worst thing is that they reply after 4-5 days on every query. I have been discussing this for the last 20 days and they have not properly responded."

          "Contenu": "I contacted Christopher McHale (T1 Support) from Hubstaff back in June 2023 to disable billing for 4 old accounts that weren't being used. After quite a bit of back-and-forth emails, the issue was resolved, with all 4 accounts being disabled.Fast forward to September 2023, I found out that these 4 old accounts were reinstated as billable Users, despite manually downgrading each account to non-billable Project Viewers. I tried following up with McHale to understand what went wrong, even though this was resolved back in June. He responded with vague details about Hubstaff moving me from an old plan to a new billing structure, despite never giving authorization to be moved to a new plan on my account. After this email, I never heard from McHale again, even after following up with him in 4 separate email threads.I don't think it's my job to chase after a support representative to respond to my emails, so I emailed Jared Brown (CEO). Brown acknowledged my issue and informed me he would look into my billing issue internally before getting back to me. As I'm writing this, 12 days have passed since I received Brown's last email thread (October 16).The conclusion I've reached is that this is a company with ZERO accountability across internal departments. They're quick to send you templated email sequences about product features and add-ons, but they will absolutely turn their back on you if you have a genuine concern about your account."

Fast forward 18 months and accounting noticed we are still being billed monthly even though the account is inactive. In order to stop billing, you need to completely \"archive\" the company. Which means, you lose access to ALL the data you had tracked. So, you need to keep every employee, past and present on the Hubstaff plan, at $7/month indefinitely in order to keep the data history. Really sketchy way for Hubstaff to make money."

However, I am a little disappointed with the entire turn of events. 1. Firstly, I had to live chat 3 times with 3 different people who gave me 3 different solutions and versions of issues causing this delay. 2. Secondly, I was told repeatedly that it will arrive by X date \"latest\" and it hasn't yet reached my account. Since I've been a user of my bank account for quite some time, I am very sure that any STRIPE payments or other gateways DO NOT take more than FIVE days to process any payment they receive. So now, I want a detailed explanation of what is going on and why I am constantly receiving false commitments when it's pretty clear that none of you have the slightest idea of what the processing time usually is. I have dealt with foreign clients throughout my career and I haven't faced such issues with ANY other platform. I will have to take action if I'm not sent:1. A detailed analysis of what went wrong with communication on your end. 2. Detailed information with visual proof of where the payment currently stands on your end. The payment from my second pay period has been processed and I'm yet to receive my first one after two whole weeks of back and forth emails. There has also not been, on your part any assurance that actually had a basis in the reality of the situation. Every Time I've been assured, I have been disappointed."

          "Contenu": "I started using Hubstaff after struggling to get my time sheets complete. I found that the app wasn't what i needed to solve this problem. So I followed the instructions on the portal to try and cancel the subscription at the end of June expecting there to be a 30 day cancellation period and not be recharged. I was charged until November when i realized that i was still being charged on my credit card statement. I rang American Express and disputed the charges and put a stop to any future charges. I have now spent many hours probably 40 hours trying to get the charge of \u00a333.96 refunded. I received a email from Tyler Sellhorn - Director of Customer Experience after I gave poor feedback but still have not received a refund. I have had to send a email to support constantly for the last 2 months will little movement either way. Hubstaff had advised that my account was not cancelled but moved to a \"free\" account. If it is a free account why have i continued to be charged. I am disappointed i ever signed up.Hubstaff did offer me 40% discount or a month free trial if i came back. But after lack of response from Tyler Sellhorn and the refusal to refund the charges i don't feel this is a trust worthy company to work with.The software for Android was very limited and did not record the correct times. I moved to SmarterTime for Android which is much better, has better functionality and is also free of charge."

Whenever I change pages, it takes at least 10-15 seconds to download.  Given I go between pages a lot, 10-15 seconds per pages really adds up.  It means I have to have Hubstaff open in several tabs and then go between the tabs.The support team are great and respond quickly to our concerns and requests.  Their advice is usually helpful and mostly results in issues being quickly resolved.Reports are fairly easy to extract although I don't understand why the excel format is offered in csv and not xlsx.  Whilst I can save changes, the formatting doesn't save and we send the reports to clients."

          "Contenu": "Initially, my experience with Hubstaff was smooth until I encountered an unexpected suspension of my account. This occurred despite having an active subscription. What added to the frustration was that this incident happened over the weekend, when I attempted to reach out to their support, but to no avail, since their support isn't available on weekends.Consequently, my team members were unable to log in and track their working hours until the following Monday. This situation prompted me to explore alternative time tracking solutions, ones that provided accessible support even on weekends.As a result, we essentially enjoyed an unplanned break over the weekend and were back to business as usual come Monday, Eastern Standard Time.During this downtime, I stumbled upon a new time tracking tool that also includes video screencasting. This tool has proven to be particularly beneficial for freelancers like myself, as it allows me to view and review their activities during their shifts. This feature has been instrumental in minimizing downtime and discouraging any slacking off."

If there were a way to have a time tracker switch to start a task from an email kind of like Toggl and ClickUp do, that just makes sense... the switching between the base dashboard and the tasks dashboard could be easier, a way to set a pay period - like right now, I can't find a way to set my billing cycle, and I am afraid to approve any time sheets because I don't want to lock myself out from tracking more time for the month (I bill in cycles of the 11th-25th and 26th-10th. I can't find anywhere to set that). If you could include Square as a billing/payment option, and if you could partner with Clickup - oh my god I would sing your praises and throw my money at you. It's these little tweaks and adjustments that would make you the system I've been looking for my WHOLE LIFE! Just saying. I am a power user and a super nerd, so if you ever want feedback, I'm happy to supply it."
