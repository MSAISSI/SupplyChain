It is like whole paragraphs have fused with previous ones and some edits don't appear to have been saved, rendering sections of the document unreadable on top of losing recent hard work.So far I haven't had this problem with files saved offline, so I've made sure to do that and it suits me just fine.Other than that problem with cloud-saving, this software has been extremely helpful to me, and the number and quality of the features it offers compared to other alternatives is exceedingly impressive."
