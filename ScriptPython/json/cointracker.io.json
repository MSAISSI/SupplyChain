This was not something I could change. It was a different coin, but imagine if they'd arbitrarily decided a bitcoin was worth $1,000,000 even though it's only worth $19,000, and didn't listen well enough to the support request to even check to see if they'd been propagating a mistake. Why should anyone trust them with tax filing???FWIW, Ticket ID #127934 was the September follow-up to the unanswered ticket ID #126906 from August."

What's the point of accurately tracking 65% of my portfolio? There is simply 0 support provided from Cointracker. They have a forum which they say that they monitor closely. But I tested that and made a post asking any single employee from Cointracker to comment. None did. Shocking, I know. And the post was filled with very disgruntled Cointracker customers. One guy even told me to run for the hills because Cointracker is actively selling your data to third parties. (Scary).Just do yourself a favor and avoid. Somebody set up this website and just keeps it running to pocket the monthly fees from suckers like myself. There is ZERO support.

They advise they are aiming to hire additional staff and to eventually address NFT reporting failures but meantime more issues arose with staking rewards reported incorrectly and transaction numbers also incorrect. Cointracker support told me someone had altered the tax capture period from a fiscal (Australian tax year) to a calendar year but WHY didn't this error get detected and fixed before releasing the update? This is dreadful quality control. Even to this date, and more than a month since the error, transaction numbers and staking reward values continue to be reported incorrectly so it would seem they still have not acted on changing the reporting period back to fiscal year. Cannot rely at all on Cointracker to support my tax return despite the AU Tax Office having certified Cointracker as an acceptable reporting program. Cointracker are apologetic but apologies do not address or fix the issues. If you are into NFT's I think you will also encounter grief if you are going to rely on Cointracker for tax reporting."

After I had reconciled my 2020 crypto transactions, it appeared that my 2017 and 2018 gains and losses per CoinTracker no longer reconciled with the tax returns I had filed for those years using the CoinTracker service. This was alarming to me, as I did not want to file my 2020 return only to have to amend it later because somehow CoinTracker's cost basis for prior years shifted from the time when I had originally prepared my prior year returns using the CoinTracker service. Interpretation: the way CoinTracker is calculating the basis for my 2017 and 2018 transactions today is different than the way the service calculated the basis for the same transactions when I originally used the service a while back.After the tax deadline had passed, on 5/19 I received a boiler plate email from the Head of Customer support saying that they only have 3 people working on customer service and that if I still have a question, then to reply. It has been over a week since then and still no update on my issue.

Fortunately all of the purchase dates, amounts, etc are correct, just for the wrong crypto.THIS CAN NOT BE EDITED as when you enter UMA at GEMINI cointracker software does not allow it as it erroneously thinks UMA at GEMINI does not exist while the only option is LUMA which of course in reality does not exist at GEMINI. Strangely enough Cointracker can\u2019t sync a crypto that does not exist at GEMINI ! Well I wonder why? Maybe UMA is a new token at Gemini, nope have had it in years past on cointracker. Maybe I am mistaken and LUMA TOKEN is the crypto I own, noooopppeee it does not even exist at the GEMINI exchange.Maybe some genius at Cointracker changed GEMINI UMA to GEMINI LUMA so UMA is no longer even an option\u2026by JOE we may be on to something now. Something that should be so very, very easy for support to fix but alas after five months and numerous attempts to get COINTRACKER to address it \u2026nothing. AND SUCH AN EASY FIX.Jessica, I got your texts this A.M. however taxes are filed for 2021 with printout of GEMINI UMA transactions along with the highlighted and date/cost matches on LUMA TOKEN as reported by COINTRACKER along with a brief note on COINTRACKER SUPPORTS lack of response on correcting this.We did manage to get locked out of our old account () so I kind of expected this issue to get corrected on what cointracker would have seen as a new account but\u2026again not true. All UMA transactions at GEMINI listed on COINTRACKER as\u2026 you guessed it LUMA TOKEN again. Now of course we no longer have access to our tax records at COINTRACKER but fortunately we downloaded them prior to losing access.After using COINTRACKER for several years and being very happy with it, this last year has been troublesome. I find it may be time to move on as COINTRACKERS support is\u2026welll\u2026not very good and when it comes to taxes the one thing the site exists for should be correct.And COINTRACKER is still being recommended as a top tax site for 2022 ????"

I completely gave up on using their downloadable IRS forms, as they have many blanks or WORSE: COMPLETELY INCORRECT DATA FOR FORM 8949.

Company is aware of issues and have been ignoring customer requests for years.Tax software integrations are nice, but imports are in no way accurate.Specifically, when you receive airdrops of crap coins with misrepresented values, there is no way to ignore these coins, so the total value of assets shown ends up being nowhere close to the actual value (ie $12,000 wallet total ends up showing as $300,000,000)"

If the support team gets back to me and helps me resolve the issue that im having then there would only be pros.Pros: I have a multitude of wallets and exchanges that I use for varius cryptocurrencies so tracking all of them has been cumbersome and frustrating but almost all of my wallets have been able to sync to cointracker! I originally started using cointracker solely for tax purposes but once I saw that cointracker also provides a live dashboard with all of my portfolio consolidated and tracked together I realized cointracker has the potential to be a one stop shop for tracking my positions. cons: the only downside ive found so far (again, only a new user here so I will likely find more undesirable aspects) is adding wallets. Most of my wallets synced no problem but the one that is most important to me does not add. This particular wallet is on ledgerlive (Algorand). It doesnt make sense to me why it doesnt sync because my other ledgerlive wallets managed to sync after a few tries but this one does not. I followed the instructions on the \"add wallet\" page and when I click \"add wallet\" nothing happens. I have this issue with 2 wallets currently. I sent the support team an email through their website and if they get back to me in a timely manner and are able to resolve this then I will gladly update this to a 5 star review. And at that point i believe the fee for cointracker's services will be more than warranted and worth every penny. Until then, Cointracker will continue to NOT be a one-stop-shop for me as I will have to use multiple platforms and websites to track/manage my investments as well as my taxes."

I have never bought it's premium features for tax purposes, since I'm only a retail investor and it wouldn't be necessary for me. I've used it for about a year and a half, or so.My only complaints are as follows: The \"Add Wallet\" feature is certainly fine but it can be frustrating when it somehow cannot add wallets, or certain blockchains not being supported. On a couple of occasions, because I couldn't add the wallets, I ended up manually entering the transactions and it was fine but very time consuming and it made me feel like I was back, tracking my coins on CMC or Coingecko again.It's a pretty great little app and I like that it's always in real time. The daily portfolio updates are nice in general just in case something drastic happens when you're not paying attention.It just feels good to have a huge tracking of my portfolio through an expanse of wallets. That's a big bonus but it's not perfect by any means. You might be frustratedly sitting there, adding transactions manually for a while but when it works, it works."

To be fair, some of the information on the Dashboard of the site can be misleading/confusing. I've upgraded from 1 star to 4 stars because of the effort they've made to resolve this & allowing for some confusion on my end (waiting for clarification on that part).  I tried the contact page several times, it doesn't go through. There is a phone number on my paid subscription confirmation email but it tells you to go to the site and use contact us.  Which I tried several times and it never goes through, the arrow just keeps spinning.The site is not adding up my fiat deposits correctly, it is also not adjusting my gains/losses correctly.  I hope someone from the company can contact me. I just did my 2020 tax year gain/loss and am wondering if it was even correct.   I don't like leaving bad reviews, but companies using the excuse that crypto is a \"new industry\" and we are experiencing substantial growth, please bear with us is just not an excuse anymore.  They're should be a phone number, even if no one is picking it up, to leave a message and someone gets back to you.  You guys really can't find operators to answer your phones?? Or you just don't want to spend the money??    I have 29 days to cancel my 2021 subscription, BUT, it doesn't even have a cancellation page, at least not one that I can find. If a company is entering an industry with a huge growth potential than you should have all your ducks in a row to deal with that growth!!  There are plenty of people at home unemployed at the moment unfortunately, I'm sure some of them have customer service experience.Sorry, don't mean to go on, but I've had this problem with one of the largest crypto exchanges in the USA and it took 5 weeks to even get an answer from them after being locked out of my account, luckily I was able to figure out how to get around the issue and after a week was back in, but with zero help from them.The service is not cheap $199, extremely disappointing at this point.  Hopefully I can resolve this and change my rating. Thank youRay03/29/21UPDATE 03/30/21Received an email from the company & hoping they can resolve my issues.  Not about canceling, it's about receiving support for serious issues & the complexity of reaching out to the company. thank you"
