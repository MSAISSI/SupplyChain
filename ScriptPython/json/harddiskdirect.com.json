After I completely verified myself Ryan from Harddiskdirect said they were refusing to fulfill the order and cancelled the order on me, it took 3 weeks to get a refund from them! Wouldn't trust them at all, especially not with any server equipment that is mission critical, they will leave you in a bad position.The update below is also a lie. They cancelled my order, and never asked me to pay extra freight. They said they had the wrong price on the website and refused to fulfill the order. DO NOT TRUST THESE LIARS!"

His answer that 'soon' does not suit us. It turns out that we are faced with fraud on the part of your company. When we paid for the invoice, all the goods were in stock, only part of this product was shipped to us without agreement with us, we asked for a refund, but we cannot get our money back, they ignore us. I do not recommend buying goods here, this company is a scammer, we have all the correspondence with Bruce and his colleagues, now we are suffering losses because we were unable to deliver the goods to our customer on time."

Despite reports to the contrary, the journey to the cloud still requires hardware onsite. We were searching worldwide for parts and finally found the two groups of adapter cards we needed at Hard Disk Direct. We reached out to the generic sales email at Hard Disk Direct, and Senior Account Manager Bob Ferguson replied. He was quick with the quote, offered us a discount to bring the order within budget and enabled the purchase method that suited our needs. Despite the 11-hour time difference, he came back to us promptly. Mr. Ferguson coordinated with his shipping department and the shipper to get the order out quickly, well packed and with the correctly filled out VAT/Customs forms. That enabled the spares to reach us without additional fees or delay. It was an excellent experience and we will work with Mr. Ferguson and Hard Disk Direct again. Thanks for the great service."

I initially found the vendor from a POC at Dell and I'm so thankful that I did! I have had nothing but Exceptional experiences with this company and more specifically with a Sr. IT Consultant! They are Excellent Communicators, Very Responsive, Professional, Competent, Positive and Friendly! l work with many Sales Representatives regularly and unfortunately, I've only found a limited number of them that provide Great customer service! Usually I have to email them multiple times and it takes too long for them to satisfy my requests, if they can at all. This is Definitely Not the case at Hard Disk Direct! This Sr. IT Consultant is a Unicorn, someone that from day 1 has Always been honest, hard working, helpful, on top of their job and really taking the initiative for building a Fantastic customer service network! They have been assisting me with part availability and providing pricing since April and it's a breathe of fresh air knowing that I'm in good hands and can trust that they are going to do what they say they are going to do! The turnaround time is absolutely top notch! I can tell that they really are putting forth their Best effort and care about their job and assisting others! I Greatly appreciate Hard Disk Direct and all of the time, effort, cooperation and assistance that I've received since discovering this company!!! All thanks to SM, this Sr. IT Consultant who really shines, is doing wonderful things to help her company and truly makes people's jobs around them more enjoyable! Thank you for Everything that you do!"
