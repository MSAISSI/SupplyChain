Right after I received the confirmation I received a message that my order had been canceled and a refund was issued because they were wrong about the inventory (said seven were left upon ordering) and they were completely out.  No offer to keep the order as a backorder just a flat out order cancelation.  Not happy with my experience but at least I saved 95 cents in the end ordering it direct from Gerber with their free shipping and 20% discount."

All slotted connections were a little tight causing some disassembly issues. Be careful as you may over exert and damage the vane."

          "Contenu": "Hello. I recently ordered and received a Kestrel 3500 Weather Meter from you. The item was a gift for my grandson so I have not had an opportunity to use it myself. I'm sure it will be well received.I appreciate you following through and asking for my input. My only criticism concerning this order was the shipping. The item was sent via USPS and I was not happy with the result. It did not arrive on time or when USPS reported that it had arrived. When I checked their website, it said the item was waiting for pickup at a local post office. After driving there and waiting in line for 30 minutes, I was told by an impolite postal worker that the item had been sent out for delivery. No apology from her for me having to waste more than an hour of my time due to incorrect information on their tracking site. She was correct, when I returned home, the meter was in my mailbox. Fortunately, it arrived just in time for me to deliver it to my grandson over Thanksgiving. Otherwise, I would have had to ship it again.In the future, I will request another option for mailing. I have had similar problems with other USPS deliveries. If I may make a suggestion, you might want to consider another option for your basic delivery service. I have never had the problems with UPS or FedEx that I have had with USPS. They really don't seem to care whether they deliver on time or how inconvenient they make it for their customers. I suspect that a basic lack of accountability within USPS is a main reason for their bad service.Thanks for the opportunity to give feedback. I hope to purchase products from ExtremeMeters again.Graham Lorch"
