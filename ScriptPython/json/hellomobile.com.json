Again, this service is nearly worthless. If there was a zero star option, I would mark it thus."

After this they transfer the call to tech support who will raise a ticket and then ask us to wait for 48 hrs. Even after a week there is no response. Then when we contact customer care, they force us through the same checks again to transfer to tech support who will ask us to  power off and power on.

The flow of the sight lets you think that it can happen.  then a warning should come up on activating the account that you should have a phone and the sim card in your hands at the same time.  Lets hope that the service works as expected.  It was just the process to get this far.  The wait and try again later, use a different browser.. use a diffrent device, clear the cookies.  if the cookies are causing such a difficult time for the customers why even use them things."

Also, 2) when they send out EAS alerts, they alert me in the form of a loud siren that is causing me to panic.  I have told this company multiple times to stop the siren, but they totally ignore me and act indignant.  This has nothing to do with my phone, as other cell providers previously on the phone I am using did not use a panicky siren.  They need to stop.  These people need to learn how to act."

I get no service at home, so I wanted to test the service where it would be available. I had full bars in town, and was able to use the data and text, no problems.I then tried to make a call. The call immediately dropped and the bars showed empty. Within a minute, the bars were back to full. I tried again, with the same result.I tried both the chat, and calling customer service. The chat person insisted that the problem was I had not \"turned on wifi calling\" in order to make calls *while at home where I have no service.* which is not at all what I wanted. She did not seem to comprehend my repeated explanations that the phone was dropping calls in areas with FULL BARS OF SERVICE.The telephone representative wasn't much better. I had to give him an address in town. Where I have service. To get him to check coverage- which he confirmed what I had already explained that I had FULL SERVICE in that area. He then proceeded to take my IMEI number... and tell me that the phone \"isn't compatible\" with the network. Even though the checker on the website says the phone is fine, and I was able to partially access the service- data and text, with the phone. It is only calls that were dropping.I'm canceling this and will absolutely not be recommending Hello Mobile to anyone. I have used several pay-as-you-go services in the past and have never dealt with this level of incompetence."

It's now September 19th 2023. So this happened 2 years ago. I have not seen a customer reward since. I really wish Hello Mobile would reward their loyal customers more, with maybe another free month of data or maybe a gift card as a thank you. I also wish that their network speed would improve. My speed really began slowing down back in November of 2022 and I was nowhere near my data limit. Now, whenever I browse using my mobile plan, it sometimes takes a decade for webpages to load or to play a YouTube video. I found out that US Mobile offers a free $25 prepaid card to their first time customers that they can use toward their monthly bill. So that means this company gives money to customers who might not even stay with them or become a loyal customer. I can't even get a reward like that from Hello Mobile and I am a loyal customer who pays every month. I wish Hello Mobile would do even better than US Mobile and offer their loyal paying customers a $25 or maybe even a $50 Visa gift card. That would be nice and it would help a loyal customer spread the word and recommend Hello Mobile. It's a bit confusing how first time customers using another mobile service gets treated better than a loyal customer who uses Hello Mobile."

          "Contenu": "Probably the most affordable cell service around. $5 per month for unlimited call/text with 500MB data is hard to beat. I haven't had any issues with call/txt reception. The 2nd month is also free which is a nice little bonus. They also didn't outright cancel my service when my credit card info changed but I forgot to update the payment info on their site. However they didn't notify me either about the payment issue. I had to contact them.Unfortunately that's where all the pros end. Everything else is pretty subpar. Their website is very basic and some things have issues; I changed my password and it took like 15 min. for the changes to go through. I could still login with my old password for that period which could be a potential security issue.Customer service is unsurprisingly lacking and their reps noticeably stick to a script. Their mobile app had a dangerous security issue a couple years ago allowing anyone who had your phone number to access your personal info, account no., history of calls/text, without any password. Even after being notified it took them months to act on this. They didn't even fix the issue they simply disabled the app. Extremely negligent and irresponsible. I'm not sure if they re-released the app but I wouldn't take the chance of using it.Wifi calling does not work on Hello Mobile. This was confirmed by their customer service. Although one person I talked to said it did work for them on their iphone so Idk. I use a moto phone.Data usage is hard capped I believe.If all you need is dirt cheap calling and txt messaging  then you might consider this. If you want more features (like wifi calling and probably a lot of others) and value good customer service this is absolutely not it. The negligence with their mobile app and site's functionality is also troubling and tells me they don't place high priority on security.  I'm giving this service 2.5 stars."

I\u2019ve never owned an Android & never will.I have Stage IV breast cancer & I may be a little grumpy, but there are sooo many Androids & OLD iPhones. I\u2019m not wasting anymore time than is absolutely necessary.  Think of your customers. Their time is valuable, too. It\u2019s like going to look at Mustangs & the salesman keeps showing Corvettes. What\u2019s the point? Not looking for Corvettes. You got him there & you\u2019re ready to try the upsell. Click bait? I should have known it was too good to be true.

I said that's not true, I punched in the IMEI number before purchasing a sim card and it said the phone was compatible. Meanwhile, the text messages are coming thru whole I'm talking to customer service. My area has terrible reception no matter what service provider. But customer service keeps telling me to replace the phone. Otherwise, their plans are priced perfectly."

They try to restore and reset the connection that takes huge amount of time, but there is nothing wrong with the connection - the only reason for slow internet speed is artificial lowering of speed from your side. But for some reason no one can tell what amout of GB is maximum for the unlimited plan before the speed will be lowered. That's my biggest concern. And this problem appears a number of times a year. There was no any problem on July and August, but for the half of May and June the speed was lowered to 0.01 mbps."

I called the support team and reviewed all the standard procedures to escalate the issue to the next tier. Eventually, I was connected to a second-tier support agent who seemed to be more knowledgeable than the first one. After reviewing the issue, he explained that the SIM was invalid due to a duplicate order. Apparently, they had sent a second SIM after the first one had already shipped, and the new number was assigned to the second SIM, making the first one invalid. It took me about two hours to figure all of this out, and I really wish I had known to ignore the first SIM from the start. In the end, the second SIM worked just fine."

Maybe even a gift card for being a good paying customer.

It took the dogged persistence (spread across 2+ weeks) of personal attempts, a 40-minute support call and 2 chat sessions to activate my Hello Mobile account on an Alcatel Axel 5004R + number both unlocked from AT&T. Signal strength inside my WDC home is weakish. At times calls take 5-10s to connect. Or, they fail, get dropped, and I have to retry 3-5X. What happens when I travel is yet to be seen... **H-O-W-E-V-E-R**, I do not regret the choice. The techs who dealt with me did their best and were cool. For the savings and seems-OK-enough reliability, my high-ish tolerance can take it."

          "Contenu": "Getting set up on the hello mobile site was super easy. I ended up getting a new number even though I have had the same number for close to 20 years give or take but I am no longer in the state that my old number was from. I have had my hello mobile phone for less than a week and here is my honest opinion:The phone: Beings I broke my old phone ( samsung galaxy a51) I needed something fast and cheap. I ended up getting the Hot Pepper serrano3 phone and honestly I 1000% HATE the phone but it was what I could afford just to get me by until I can afford a better phone. The phone itself is very touchy and unresponsive a lot of the time especially if I am trying to look at my bank accounts, bus app, or uber. I have had to take the battery out multiple times a day and restart the phone. Just today (November 21,2023) It rebooted itself while I was trying to get my crew app that I use for work going after I was sent the link Sunday night ( it literally took that long for me to get the text message for the link). I don't know if it is the service OR the phone. IF you need a starter phone that is for the very basic needs of making calls and taking calls its okay at best but wouldn't advise getting this phone if you like to play games on your phone and for social media purposes. I hope to get a new phone soon because I am about to toss this phone out a ten story building window. Maybe with time it will cooperate but in the mean time the Hot Pepper Serrano 3 is not a phone I would get ever again.The service:I made a phone call earlier and while I was on a call somehow my phone dialed the number again which was weird again it may be the phone itself. I will say the sim card worked right away after inserting it into the phone but I wasn't quite impressed with the quality of the sim card ( cheap flimsy plastic) when the sim card from my old phone was metal ( guess I just got to get used to that) The data seems to be fine for the most part however I am in situations where I use wifi most of the time. To start i got the 15 dollar plan which for the time being is enough until I renew the service in which I may go with a different plan for the simple fact that I do use the transit app for my area to catch the bus and I need something with a lot of data for that reason or reasons if I am out of a wifi accessible area. The call that I did make however was rather clear. The other issue I seem to have is not receiving text messages right away. For verification codes it comes in okayish but again the text my manager sent to my phone with a link to my crew app took about a day and a half. Again I don't know if it is the phone or the service. I know it has only been a handful of days so only time will tell if things will improve or not but I am hopeful it will because I like the concept of Hello Mobile and if the service works better than this super. I am also considering that the phone is a 4glte phone and not 5g so that may have something to do with it so maybe with a better phone the service will improve. I am not going to discredit them just yet especially since the plans are really affordable. My boyfriend's daughter just ordered a sim card for a bring your own phone plan through Hello Mobile. When she gets it we will see if she has better service or if the issues are still the same. I know my review isn't exactly fair since I am a new customer BUT I will give a new review once I have had the service a little longer. I will say that having the second month free is really cool and your account is very easy to navigate through. If you do end up getting a phone through Hello Mobile I will say go through all the apps and get rid of what you know you won't use. I had to with the Serrano 3 because it has very limited space. that is the other reason I want to get a better phone."

They never could give me exactly numbers when will it slow down as some reps say 15 g and some say after excessive use of data.. I decided to see what is real story behind the $25 unlimited.  The porting my # to them was pretty simple but still when calling 611 said my service past due but my service paid off for 2 months.  I started testing Speed with my s21Ultra I got up to 100 mbps. But it was only until I reached 2g of use of data and then it dropped to 5-7 mbps speed.. I even called them but they use support team who does same network reset but nothing happened until I reached 5g of data used.. then the speed dropped to 1mbps. And I assume it will drop even more soon ... I guess their $25 plan is just not really unlimited 4 or 5 g plan as they put limit pretty quick on it. The support service is horrible as you can't hear them as they talk out of bathroom or in airport... I hope it will help you to decide"

          "Titre": "I recently switched to Hello Mobile",
          "Contenu": "I recently switched to Hello Mobile, and overall, my experience has been fairly positive. Here's a breakdown of my thoughts on the service:Pros:Affordable Plans: Hello Mobile offers competitive pricing, making it an attractive option for budget-conscious users. The plans provide a good balance of data, talk time, and text messages at reasonable rates.Coverage: The coverage has been reliable in most urban areas, and I haven't experienced any major issues with dropped calls or poor signal quality. However, it's essential to check the coverage map to ensure it meets your needs in specific locations.Simple Activation Process: Setting up the service was straightforward, and I appreciated the ease of activation. The SIM card arrived quickly, and I was able to start using the service without any significant hiccups.Customer Service: While I haven't had many issues, the customer service I've encountered has been responsive. They addressed my inquiries in a timely manner and were generally helpful.Cons:Data Speeds: The data speeds can be inconsistent, especially during peak hours. Streaming or downloading large files may not be as smooth as with some other providers. It's essential to manage your expectations regarding data speed.Limited International Features: If you frequently travel internationally, Hello Mobile might not be the best choice. The international features are somewhat limited, and roaming charges can add up quickly.App Functionality: The mobile app, while functional, could use some improvements in terms of user interface and features. It lacks some of the conveniences provided by larger carriers.Hidden Fees: Keep an eye out for potential hidden fees that may not be immediately apparent when signing up. Some users have reported unexpected charges that weren't clearly outlined in the initial plan details.In conclusion, Hello Mobile is a decent option for individuals seeking a budget-friendly phone plan with reliable coverage in most areas. While it may not have all the bells and whistles of larger carriers, it serves its purpose well for those who prioritize affordability. However, there's room for improvement in terms of data speeds, international features, and app functionality."

It didn't have E-sim but it could use a sim card. The rep was so helpful in understanding my situation and getting it all ordered hassle free and there was no additional charge even though I believe there is normally. I received my sim in less than a week. I popped out my old sim and popped in the new one with that nifty sim tool that was included. I didn't need to do anything else and it was working instantly. I have perfectly clear calls, excellent reception, high speed 4g in the model phone I have. This has been the best experience I have ever had with a carrier overall.Highly recommend 5 out of 5Thanks Hello Mobile"
