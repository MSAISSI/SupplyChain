          "Contenu": "Many direct import connections do not work, or work intermittently. The YNAB solution is to remove and re-add the connection, which is a complex set of steps. If you want to keep your budget current everyday, this becomes a cumbersome process. Mutliple contacts with customer support results in a cheerful but vague response that they are working the issue. If you check YNAB's status report on its direct import connection status, it details so many issues that it is a 19 minute read.Without a reliable direct import, the app is more time consuming than it is worth. YNAB may work for some but it also does not work for many."

          "Contenu": "YNAB has a massive amount of missing features and has been stagnant as a platform for way too long. I really like this platform but for the price it\u2019s pretty unacceptable that it hasn\u2019t seen platform growth in years. It has so much potential but feels like you built something 10 years ago and are coasting off it. If it doesn\u2019t see improvement in many areas soon I\u2019m done. For instance other budgeting software can login to Amazon to auto catalog purchases. Please look at other software on the market and wake up.Edit: In response to the response of this review look no further than /release-notes and just how many of these bullet points aren't user facing features and are things like \"Another round of backend updates\" \"no visual changes\" on loop. I get that the person in charge of writing these release notes has to be fun and cute with what is ultimately nothing new, it's hard to read all of these and try and claim like there has been any real progress in this app and this response isn't convincing me that's going to change anytime soon. I'll start looking elsewhere."

Honestly I could do that without a service charging me for really nothing except a template. I\u2019ve been very disappointed. In the past years YNAB has been so helpful. Their customer service is great. I know the problem will be solved so I will continue to use YNAB as I have for the past 7 years."

The whole point of me subscribing to YNAB was because importantly that i could import alot of my transactions saving me time to manually input transactions.I am bitterly dissapointed with the service i am getting which is definately not the service i paid a premium to YNAB for. i rely alot on YNAB and i am left dissapointed."

The budgeting concepts are good; and, I do recommend that you buy the book and implement the four rules in your budgeting process.The company is not to be trusted.  The software has been buggy from the beginning.  Appeals to fix the linking issues have gone on for years, with half-hearted fixes and a vendor change to Plaid.  The vendor change wasn't adequately tested at the time, and charges were not being imported correctly (Plaid had a little trouble with debits being credits for a while there).  YNAB didn't even know it was going on when its users first started complaining about it.  Testing before implementation feels good, man. The recent treatment of YNAB customers over the price hike really was just the icing on a very old cake.  The entire debacle has been very telling in terms of how the company views its users.  The contempt of their customers was overt in answers to questions posed in an online forum.  They have never listened to their users' concerns in any of the fires they've had to put out over the years.  And they really don't have any intention to start.  YNAB does not value its customers.  It has continuously been the buggiest budget software out there, with no concern about fixing its own issues.Steer clear."

The price hike was particularly awful, given YNAB backtracked on their promise to keep YNAB grandfathered into the original price. Felt like a big slap in the face and a betrayal of trust. Regarding the product itself... wish I could attach receipts to transactions, make a budget template for general planning purposes, have better data visualizations for understanding my financial state, have better investment tracking. Syncing has never worked very well, and I feel like my relationship with YNAB is glorified data entry instead of letting me spend my time understanding and exploring and planning around my financial state."

I have to click on transactions, remember the correct amount to pay, for example 24.95\u20ac, I have to enter it, add the payee, add the category, add the transaction. Every category should be clickable and show options to change the budget, mark as paid, add transaction. Despite being extremely user-friendly, adding all expenses is very stressful for me. The budget should be modified monthly and only show the current expenses screen. I always use English for everything else, but this app, one of the few, I would have liked to have in Italian which seems to not be available. I breathe a sigh of relief to eliminate it. Before, I used a simple excel and added rows every day in a simple way. One column for the budget, one column for what was spent. Now I will try Spendee or Mint.\ud83d\ude16"

However, every few months, something with the importing would break. Sometimes some of my accounts just wouldn't import, and most recently I had an issue where all of my credit card charges would shows as duplicated positive inputs to my bank account. I'd get in to a cycle where I'd get everything set up, use it consistently for a bit, something new would break, and I'd get out of the habit of using it again while I was trying to figure out how to fix what was broken. I ultimately canceled my subscription this year in 2022 because the import issues were too much hassle for the budgeting I wanted to do. I still miss the service sometimes, but I didn't want to keep paying for something that I wasn't going to get much use out of because it kept breaking."

It helped me move to a point where I was living on last month's income and I couldn't not have been happier. That version didn't require a subscription, just a few Dropbox account. Eventually the app stopped syncing with Dropbox and I was forced to \"upgrade.\" This new version doesn't have a few of the features that helped me the most. I can't set up my budget for next month. I have to allocate my funds in the same month so I can't just lay out next month's budget to get a sense of how much I'm going to need. All in all, I'm disappointed with the new version of YNAB. What used to be a one time payment around $20 is now a yearly fee around $100 and the experience has actually degraded for the cost. It's still a useful utility but, is a shadow of what it used to be. I would get rid of it to save money but, I haven't found anything better yet."

For example, I spend $100 in gas on 4/29/23 and it will not show up on YNAB till roughly 5/2/23, which makes sense. But now the debt has been incurred in April with no way for me to know other than me tracking my credit card debt like a hawk. One workaround i found was to change the expense date to sometime in May to bring that credit card expense into the current month so i can tackle it. I guess making us aware that our debt didnt go away bc we're in a new month with a notification would be cool or perhaps keep that debt on the category and carry it over in the category, much like is done with the credit card account."

The transaction filtering feature is very limited and will frustratingly reset every time you change another filter (e.g. if you filter for a time range, and subsequently filter for a transaction type, the date filter will disappear).  A lack of a robust tagging system forces me to use my own codes in the memo which is time consuming and produces incorrect reports when I make a typo.  Finally, the inability to carry over negative category balances month to month remains an infuriating feature.  YNAB's philosophy has dictated this experience, NOT customer feedback.  It's very Apple -- \"We know better than you.\"  I've sampled many budgeting apps over the last 15 years and can say they're all lacking fundamental functionality and sort of suck in irritating ways. YNAB is the best among them, but being the best of the worst isn't exactly a great claim."

The big one being, random and large price increases with poor communication regarding the changes. The price is a pretty large barrier to entry and tough for me to recommend at the latest price points. From an end user perspective I\u2019ve seen these increase fees go towards trying to onboard new customers instead of add features long time users have been asking for. I\u2019ve also seen new features come out in an unfinished state (such as the loan tracker) which caused me to have to use a lot of workarounds.Overall it\u2019s a great product, but with the random, giant price jumps and lack of features that benefit long time users, I keep my eye out for alternatives."

This is no longer the case in the new online version. The budget from last month is only used if it is a positive value. This does not work with the way I am budgeting.2. It is simply to expensive.

          "Contenu": "I started using YNAB over a year ago after the budgeting/envelopes tool I used closed. For the most part, I love YNAB. The user-interface is easy to understand. As a tool, it helps keep the budgeter on track and committed to goals. In general, tools like these are great for those who want to get Credit Card rewards, yet also pay off their credit card balance every month. Having not started YNAB with consumer debt, I cannot speak to how quickly the program can help someone get on track financially, but in principle, YNAB is designed with financially freedom in mind.My only reason for giving 4 stars instead of 5 is for some of the higher level, complex budgeting options, not currently available that I would love to see YNAB offer. For instance, I often have to pay for items and then submit a reimbursement through my employer. I know that I will have the money, as it is not really money spent out of my own budget, but YNAB has no good method for that. Rather, I have to submit preemptive deposits to keep my account from appearing overspent. I imagine that most people do not need the type of function I mention, but for me, this is a small frustration with YNAB."

However, there were some bugs this year when I switched my FNBO password and YNAB stopped conecting to my bank for a month or more. I didn't like that I couldn't call anyone and it took several weeks to get a useful human response. Also, I don't like that YNAB won't carry over a negative account balance into the next month. If I assign my money over multiple months and I over spend in a category this month, after it changes to the next month I have to go to the last month I assigned money to because it takes it from there. I don't know if that makes sense but it's a weird and confusing process. It's still a really great service and I appreciate it a lot. Also, love the new branding!"

We have been budgeting well for 30 years and do the right things. :) I understand WHY YNAB has it up for the utmost accountability.  Our issue is that we budget for the year. Each month is an average of what we need to budget per month. If we go negative in gifts in May because we have 5 birthdays and Mother's Day, we know it will settle out in June because we only have Father's Day. It would be VERY helpful if you had a switch in settings to allow us to carry over a negative balance in a budget category to the next month so we can settle it up easily.  We currently have to keep an additional spreadsheet to even things up month to month. This is our one complaint and it is why we continue to look for a different program that creates less work for us. However, this is by far the best we have found so far."

The answers are not realtime but once they get on the case they figure out what's going on and can explain it.There is kind of a learning curve but if you understand the envelop system of budgeting and can embrace the four rules then YNAB has a chance to make a real difference for a new budgeteer."

The people in customer service know their product well and have outstanding communication skills.  The only reason I did not give a perfect score is because of Plaid.  Plaid is the only issue I've had to contact customer service.  The on going training sessions are done well with clear explanations on how and why we budget the YNAB way."

I replaced my beloved MacBook Pro with a new iPad Pro, and my YNAB experience has suffered a bit. It\u2019s hard to get important reports, and articles and tutorials for all the things are geared toward desktop. (I\u2019ve been told I can switch modes and more easily access my reports, but after several attempts I gave up.) These are small issues compared to the epic benefits.

You can learn the fundamentals in a few minutes. I would prefer a few more reporting capabilities, but many people will not need that level of information. My only gripe is a minor issue with syncing between the iOS and PC versions: the two apps mirror transactions exactly, but sometimes \u201capproved\u201d transactions in one are not marked as \u201capproved\u201d in the other, causing me to have to manually approve them on my phone and PC.

Categorizing everything made it really easy to figure up my tax write offs, which is awesome!There\u2019s still a lot of features I don\u2019t know how to use, but even without all of that, I have a much firmer grip on how my money is spent each month, and that\u2019s a huge help!I definitely recommend it."

          "Contenu": "YNAB is a pretty good tool and has helped me get more organized and learn about budgeting.  One thing is I think they\u2019ve over complicated the software and budgeting.  If software is easy to use incorrectly, then the user will fall into a pitfall despite everyone\u2019s best intention.  One example of this is that I still can\u2019t believe there is not a budget interface in the system where I can see the whole year at once.  Just a spreadsheet basically with the columns as months and the rows as expense categories or income categories.  Then a subtotal column ect and final yearly numbers to have a full projection of a year.  Instead i have to export my budget to a spreadsheet and work with it in excel?  For a specific example, see how this property management software has a dead simple budgeting tool. help.buildium(dot)com/hc/s/article/Budgets So in summary I\u2019m grateful to YNAB for helping me along my budgeting experience, as I use more book keeping tools and accounting tools, I\u2019m realizing they overcomplicated some things and left out some important things.  Keep up the good fight YNAB."

In our case it's fine, but that may be problematic for other businesses that are more tightly budgeted and unclear about how the billing works for wellness accounts."

Secondly, the main reason I used YNAB was because I had to properly budget to prevent myself from going into debt, which ironically means that by using YNAB I learned I shouldn't be paying over ninety euros on a service that is available far cheaper even if I think it worth it."

This means you actually use it as a budget and not a tracking system that runs in the background and you look at once a year after the spending has already taken place. -The software forces you off the credit card float. Which before YNAB I didn't even know I was on. This means I can pay off my credit card bill in full at any point.-No guessing. You know where your money is, and you know exactly what you can afford, and what you can't.-Great for couples who share finances. Each person has their own log in, and multiple accounts can be linked to YNAB.Cons:-The import feature is a bit gimmicky and doesn't always work. There are other options for importing transactions, and YNAB tech support is fantastic, but still, I wish it was better. -Reports could be better on the web, and they are basically non-existent on the app. There is a web extension called \"Toolkit Reports\" which bridges this gap, but for the price, I don't think I should have to rely on random web extensions.

I was into budgeting before my wife and I got married, with most of it being with EveryDollar and the folks of the Ramsey network. The people at YNAB are just more supportive, understanding that how people want to spend their money is as varied as the person who earned it. We don't get yelled at for NOT living on rice and beans, or using credit cards responsibly, and we don't get berated for spending money on the things we enjoy WHILE we pay off debt. And if we decided to sprint, the folks at YNAB would still be there to support and cheer us on. Because they're so damn awesome. I get to watch our net worth go up as we pay down debt, save some money here and there, and we do this all while being encouraged to think about what we want our money to do for us. The only thing I'd like to see added to the Income and Expenses report is an approximate savings rate each month and annualized as well. The Age of Money is awesome as well. MANY thanks to Jesse and the YNAB crew!"

For many years we were using Quicken and for a number of reasons decided it was time to leave, their app and lack of interest in customer issues related to the app being just one. After searching YNAB appeared to be the best choice. We were already trying to follow a zero based budgeting stategy so the transition to YNAB wasn't that difficult. Not saying it was seemless, but with the help of the many video tutorials the transition went pretty well. Needless to say, we just renewed our subscription for another year. YNAB is easy to use, clever in how it handles your budget needs, and provides updates as needed in a timely manner. Another thing I personally like is how rapidly the team responds to questions when something occurs that I cannot figure out on my own. The mobile app is quick and easy to use and actually makes it enjoyable to enter transactions at the time they occur."

The category groups, categories, reports, the integration with banks and credit cards to get transactions, and their support is polite and quick to respond. Plus, they teach you how to use the product and how to have a budget and why! Amazing!The mobile app is amazing! Having my accounts AND my budget in the palm of my hand is invaluable! I can be out and about and need to buy something and just grab phone to see what I have in that category and move things around if needed.I have tried a lot of different tools, including making my own, YNAB has been the best and easiest to learn and has all of the features I needed when it comes to managing my money. YNAB removed the excuses for me to not have a good budget and to not manage it well. Dang you YNAB! :) And also, Thank you YNAB!"

On the days I don\u2019t feel like diving in to my financial situation, I often smile when greeted by \u2018I like big budgets and I cannot lie\u2019 and other similar messages. It\u2019s a relatively small thing but it makes it fun. The tutorials are super helpful when getting started. The basic tracking of income and expenses is very intuitive but I\u2019ve found the asset and tracking capabilities to be super helpful for envisioning the future. The reports function is another great feature that I\u2019ve found a great deal of benefit from. Keeping an eye on your \u2018age of money\u2019 over time has been a real eye opener for me. I will definitely be sticking with YNAB and highly recommend it to a lot of people trying to maximize their financial chops!"
