I use it for my basic blog posts to more advanced data and it just works. I recently had an issue (the only issue really) with the sticky headers breaking the CSS. Stefan couldn't reproduce the issue so took the extra step to login and figure it out and did so in under 2 days (mostly back and forth via emails, the solving was fast). This level of support is what motivated me to come here and leave a review."
