Thankfully I cancelled card and didn't get billed. The response says they had self cancel option but at the time it was not available as others have said. The time it took to respond to trustpilot review I'd already cancelled my card and I never received response to my message I sent directly to them.As others have said this is a scam. To be fair I got a decent cover letter out if it but when I went to cancel my 14 day trial there were no options to cancel.Emailed them and no response, not even a generic we will be in touch on 48 hours. No idea how this company can get away with not having a cancellation policy or way to cancel, thankfully I realised very quickly so reported to my bank not to allow any further payments."

          "Titre": "THIS SITE IS A SCAM",
          "Contenu": "THIS SITE IS A SCAM. THERE IS NO WAY TO CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION.  Do your research and do not use it. I fully agree with others that this is clearly a scam. There is a charge for $2.95 for a 14 day trial.  Once you put your credit card information and you are notified that you will be charged $23.95 each month after the trial is over.  What you can\u2019t access after putting the information in is your account information and a place to effectively cancel your subscription. Again, THERE IS NO WAY TO CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION. I tried to cancel my subscription on the website, but there was no where to click so I sent an email to their support.  It was my fault for not doing my due diligence and looking the company up first or I would\u2019ve come across these reviews and not even used the website.  I sent my email on March 23 requesting cancellation and then I decided to cancel my credit card because I was afraid they were going to try to put the charge through anyways. I was correct as I received an email on March 27 that my credit card payment did not effectively go through.  I had notified them of this in the previous email that I sent on March 23.  This company uses Stripe as their credit card payment processor.  Once I got the email that was automated about the payment not going through. I immediately contacted the support email for AI pro and copied Stripe Customer Service.  I figured one way or another we would get an answer.  After a two day email chain with Stripe (March 27&28), Stripe advised they were going to escalate and look further into this business.  Today, April 6, I received an email acknowledging my request to cancel my subscription from this company. I can only imagine the only reason I received this email was that I contacted Stripe Customer Service about the inability to cancel a subscription.  No reputable company is going to have it where their customers or potential customers have no access to cancel a subscription. That\u2019s poor business practice and it is a scam.  Until they update their website and transparency, as well as giving customers a place to effectively cancel the subscription on their website like most businesses, I will not believe otherwise.  Further, there\u2019s not enough information on the about a section of their website that tells you anything about their company.  It looks good as an aesthetically pleasing website, but is incredibly shady in hindsight.Update: In regards to their response that self cancel is available, unless they just changed it, that is not the case. I would click manage account and there was no way to click anything else. I assure you I am quite tech savvy.  Their site brought me back to the same place with no option to cancel. Hovering over the \u201clinks\u201d did nothing and nothing under \u201cmy account\u201d was clickable. There was no link or button to \u201ccancel subscription\u201d. I understand that they may be working to save face however, it is the initial lack of transparency that has been the issue all along. Not just for me but for others as well."

The Toyota Camry and Corolla models were especially popular due to their affordability and fuel efficiency.Honda - Honda was recognized for its Accord and Civic models, both of which were high-selling due to their reputation for quality, reliability, and good fuel economy.Nissan - Nissan was popular for its range of vehicles including the Maxima and Sentra models. They were highly regarded for their performance, durability, and solid build quality.These brands significantly contributed to the rise of Japanese vehicles in international markets during the 1990s.and koreanDuring the 1990s, the Korean car industry was not as globally recognized or as diversified as it is now. However, two major manufacturers stood out:Hyundai - Hyundai had already been exporting cars to the United States since the mid-1980s. The Hyundai Sonata was one of the models that had a prominent sales figure in the 1990s.Kia - Kia Motors also started exporting to the United States in the early 1990s. They initially delivered small, affordable cars like the Sephia and later the Sportage, a compact SUV.These two brands pioneered the Korean automobile industry's development, and their influence extends to current-day global markets.OK provide 3 car names for each of themI apologize for the confusion, but to provide better assistance, could you please clarify who or what \"them\" refers to in your question? Are you looking for car names for specific manufacturers, car types, time periods, or categories?3 car names of the brands you mentioned earlierI apologize for the confusion, but our previous conversation didn't include specific car brands. Could you please share the car brands you're interested in so I can provide models from those?"

The ability to ask questions and engage in meaningful conversations has been priceless.A strong suit of AI Pro is how quickly it responds with precise and thorough information, and its feature that allows for ongoing conversation has helped me get clearer understandings. This is what really distinguishes AI Pro and makes it a trustworthy resource for learning.A few extra features, in my opinion, would be helpful to further improve the user experience. First off, adding a voice option would be great because it would make the experience more interactive and unique. Additionally, enabling AI Pro to generate visuals, such as tables, calendars, schedules, and even forms, would be immensely valuable.  It would be even more awesome if AI Pro had the option to connect to the web in real-time, providing up-to-date information alongside its robust knowledge base.  If these functions are already present, it would be greatly appreciated if they came with clear instructions on how to make the most of them.Overall, I am highly satisfied with the tools provided by AI Pro. Its ability to supply immediate information, engage in conversations, and foster knowledge growth is commendable. With the suggested enhancements, AI Pro has the potential to become an even more indispensable resource for individuals seeking diverse information and interactive functionality."
