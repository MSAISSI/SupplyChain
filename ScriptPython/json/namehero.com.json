          "Contenu": "On the occasion of my upcoming plan anniversary term, I wanted to stay at Namehero but downgrade from my \"Business Cloud\" plan to a lower one.What sounds like a reasonable request turned into a nightmare (Ticket #031413). As of now, I have lost 7 of my websites.Details below:Before the renewal of my web hosting at Namehero on 8 November 2023, I wanted to downgrade my hosting plan to 'Plus Cloud.'Upon login to my Namhero account to downgrade via the menu in the dashboard, it said I had to pay my bill for the upcoming renewal before being able to downgrade and receive relevant credits.I trusted Namehero and executed the invoice payment for the upcoming renewal before the anniversary on term 8 November.After paying the invoice, there were no options to downgrade from \"Business Cloud\" to \"Plus Cloud,\" but only options to subscribe to more options or to terminate the plan.Because of this, I immediately asked for the termination of the Business Cloud service with a message explaining that I wanted to downgrade to 'Plus Cloud.' After submitting, I received a confirmation email saying my service would be terminated in 24 hours.I reached the support immediately, saying it was a misunderstanding and I just wanted to downgrade, but there were no options to do so. They confirmed their understanding of my request and asked me to wait for further details.Only on 8 November I finally received an email saying that I'd been downgraded and received the relevant credit.What sounds great turned out to be horrific: upon checking, my seven websites were not reachable anymore, and I lost my access to the CPanel.I'm now waiting to hear from them; I hope to get my website back up as soon as possible.I don't understand in 2023 how a simple downgrade wiped out all my website, knowing that all invoices were paid in advance."

The incident was 'current service disruption on elon.securewebhosting.net' which affected the customers' websites. The downtime occurred due to part of the server  hardware overheating which caused thermal damage to the drives. It then became an issue of safely retrieving data from the server.The company were prioritizing their own migration, and allowed limited access for customers who wanted to migrate their data manually (at capped speeds). When I contacted NameHero about the damage to my business and sales, I was informed that as I was an indirect customer (the hosting was with a NameHero reseller) that they weren't going to discuss it with me further. Awful experience, even worse customer service. Thank goodness, we were able to retrieve most data and are now with another company which is a lot better."

This was before I could even supply payment information. Annoying, but sometimes automated systems get it wrong. I contacted support and was told I would need to provide private information in the form of a photo of my government-issued ID plus credit card or the PayPal transaction details. I explained in three separate messages to support that I don't have transaction details because the payment screen was never even shown. Support ignored this and simply kept insisting for me to provide transaction details--which is impossible since a transaction never was created. As a test, tried signing up as a business with completely different and valid payment details that I use for services like AWS and other hosts. I'm US based and not using a VPN. Still flagged. Can only conclude their system is broken or Namehero is deliberately trying to harvest private government IDs. Either way, support was a frustrating waste of time."

I do have a screenshot of the entire ticket conversation with support with timestamps, and in it, you can see how long it took support to reply (if they replied at all). That was the problem. meanwhile, my client's websites were down all that time potentially costing me my customers.

What happened is that I use many hosts, and I can get my money back if a misunderstanding occurs, but what happened here is other than that. The renewal was automatic on the server, although I am sure a million percent that it is closed, and the problem is that they told me that the renewal is open automatically.Why, if it was ok, the renewal took place 15 days after the renewal date, and the visa was withdrawn without my knowledge, and the subscription was suspended, but once the renewal was completed for a month according to the old bill, so it had 14 days left instead of a full month, and what they did was calculate the subscription period from the month that I did not subscribe to originally They pay me for 16 days. I did not use them, and after the renewal date. My experience in this field is great. This is the worst technical support in my life."

I was their affiliate member and once I cross the $500 payout milestone, they are not adding new affiliate income to my account and upon sending 100's of emails to the support team and submitting support tickets they never replied and to my surprise they deactivated my account without giving any reason or sending an email and I am not able to access my account. Soon I will migrate all my clients to a better hosting company and will advise everyone to never use their services."

          "Contenu": "I am shocked that so many people say their customer service is great?!  I am reasonably tech-savvy, but have been left in the dark by ALL of their customer reps 10x's now! Their advice is technical, they take 5-8 minutes to answer, and they don't even apologize or acknowledge their rudeness. I have never had this bad of customer service with any software I have bought, and I am a software junkie.  I'm not sure if they are training new people in 22' or what is going on?  After my transfer from Bluehost, everything went downhill. I decided to keep my Bluehost account because their customer reps actually helped me with stuff I was doing in NameHero! That is ridiculous! I am so mad that I now have to find alternatives just to have a faster site. Every time I do anything on their site I end up getting pissed all over again. If you are not an actual coder or backend web designer stay far away! Also, 500 errors with no explanation, sending me to half-done articles instead of walking me through issues, and one guy even stopped talking to me completely. Did I not just pay for a 3 year plan? I wanted to cancel one week in, but now it's been a few months and I just can't with this any longer. The only thing that has kept me is the fact that I think my multisite will crash with the transfer and per usual I won't have any help."

          "Contenu": "How can I qualify Namehero LLC, of so let me tell you about my experience, I had Webhosting, domains, and email's with them. The Webhosting is one of the slowest I ever had, no SSL, very expensive if you want to buy it, it is impossible to use WordPress because they have incompatibilities with MYSQL and you have to use PHP 7.0 to make it work, many themes and plugins work only with PHP 8.0. Domain, they use a company called Internet.bs (BS is exactly the kind of service they give) they normally \"FAKE\" emails as if they are coming from ICANN simulating delays. For a regular transfer of a domain, go to the previous register (PR) and remove the lock and get the authorization code, go to the new register (NR) and start the transfer with the authorization code, then go back to the PR and agree with the transfer and DONE. With Namehero LLC you have to wait for Internet.bs to release the domain, more than 5 days after. Email, the server they use keeps blocking the IP number from my home, I called 3 times, every time saying DO NOT BLOCK MY IP AGAIN, but it keeps happening. Imagine having to use a VPN to get your emails. And talking about privacy, they let you send emails only if they like the subject, if somebody sends you an email saying amazon account (maybe a scam) they will never let you reply to this email. Even in a regular workday, if you have an email interchange with coworkers, they don't let you send more than 50 emails in one hour. And a very dark way to do business, they like to ask for copies of ID and Credit card, when they really have no authority to ask for it, not a governmental office or a financial institution. They are a private entity. And what about the storage of all these copies."

          "Contenu": "This has been a very bad experience so far but the worst one is still ongoing.Yesterday morning our website went down and at some point we were logged out and as we speak we still can\u2019t get back to business.We have ask for help and we received a link to a YouTube video to fix the problem ourselves which was a tutorial to do a manual backup. No assistance, just a tutorial video.We did the whole thing and what we found? That our last backup was done almost a month ago when it supposed to be done on a daily basis and automatically.When we reached out again to tell about this new issue, we were told that they were having a trouble with their servers but we would be able to access again with no problems and without any data loss. After few hours, we could see again our site working but guess what? We lost a month worth of content and nobody seems to know why. But wait\u2026there is more. So after we accepted the idea of losing all the published but now lost content, we thought \u201cmaybe we can just re upload all the stuff again from our Wordpress dashboard and call it a day but nope, we lost all our admin/login data and they still don\u2019t know how that happened so now we can only see out website as visitors and not as admins.Last thing we were offered was that they could \u201ctry\u201c to do a backup from 5th or 10th April but now, suddenly those options are not available anymore.It is very frustrating to be left like this and without any clear and honest answer from these people that seem to be very confused of what happened.By now we are preparing for the worst case scenario which is to forget about our website and all the work we have put into it.The other bad experience we had with the service was the very first day that we purchased the hosting package and domain (same that is giving us all the mentioned troubles atm) and we were charged twice the price listed but not getting the product.After issuing a complain we had to wait a whole day to get the refund and once we did the purchase again, the difference of price was enormous (this was in 24 hours and it went from 300 plus euros to over 500 euros) so we issued another ticket and got the right price.So this has been our bitter experience so far and hopefully we can get our site back the same way we trusted it to this company in the very beginning, full and without any lost content.UPDATE: Until now, nothing has been fixed and even worse, we have new issues added to this experience:-We have received mails from at least 10 different people telling us the same \"we have escalated this issue to whatever senior/higher ranked individual to look into the problem\"  and not even ONE person was able to explain what was the problem.(Only the very first message we received before all went to hell was from a person named ASHITHA that told us that NameHero servers had a \"glitch\")-We reached out to CEO Ryan Gray with the Ticket ID about the problem as he offered HIMSELF to get involved and see what was the problem and guess what? We got nothing from him either.-Our website not only has no access but it is no longer visible.-We also received a pretty standard answer that we were fully refunded from NameHero on the 20/04/23 which we did receive a refund payment but then they once again took back money from our card without letting us know and without explanation. They just took it and it was the same amount that was initially refunded. INSANE!!-After noticing the issue and the gravity of this action, We have reached out to them and their response was (We are sorry to see you leaving our service and we will refund your money) This is after they told the same speech and did the whole refund spectacle we just mentioned before.-Right this moment, we have received another mail where they are stating that they can't see the money issue and now we supposed to send the card information, the amount paid in USD, transaction ID and card holder which is shady as hell as we got all notifications related to our business from MasterCard of every single transaction done with this card which happens to be for business purposes only. This information is sure held by their accountant department as we did already purchases these tools from NameHero and with the same business credit card.So as you can see, this is very frustrating and it feels like these people are just playing with us at this point. Three weeks have passed already since this started and we have lost  a lot in terms of money, business relations and reliability.(We sent them a copy from the masterCard app with all the detail showing that unauthorized transaction and their reply was that they are happy that we continue to work through this with them but they are still looking into their credit card processor)Not sure if we are the unluckiest people on earth but this has been an awful experience."

If you sign up with them and then regrett it, you will have to pay them 9$ in what they call setup fee(wich is a scam in it self) The so called setup fee they charge you for, is a service that WHMCS does automaticly for them, so its just a scammy way to steal 9$ from the customer that left them. Company with shady refund policy is something you should AVOID. there are so many hosting company out there. NAMEHERO should not be one you consider."

After this they asked me to provide my full credit card details including my CVV, although the payment itself has already been made.And also: how come they have an automated billing for around 300 dollars after the first year, if I only pay 100 for the first year? Smells like scam.Answer to your reply from 15.02.2022: As regards the fraud status, I could first clarify it after talking to my bank. All the messages I received from your service team were actually false, when they said e.g. they did not receive any payment and that I should pay again (!). I wonder what this fraud status is all about, as it never happened to me before.As regards the verification of the last 4 digits, I had previously sent you a copy of my credit card with the last four digits visible on it and upon request of your service team. So no clue why additional data was needed. Plus the form that I was asked to fill out was for an automated billing."

At least with my previous hosts (Bluehost), I could easily navigate and never had issues like this.I wish I never invested my money in them.  Now, I have an awful-looking site, I don't want to try and work on it, and I am ready to dump it all and move on (including losing hundreds of dollars).****UPDATE****I got a brief message from the founder however, I continue to have ridiculous issues.  Now, while trying to update my theme and change the overall appearance of my site through a staging site and get constant messages saying my site is down for scheduled maintenance.Not being able to call someone directly and get my issue resolved over the phone is frustrating.  At least with my old hosting company, I could call and get someone to walk me through the issue and resolve it quickly."

They said fine use our business package. I was not informed that I would only get 1 migration.

My other 10 websites are now subdomains of my main website. I think some re-write rules makes it appear as if they are independent websites.Their support service is crap. They use cheap staff from India that busily mess up your website making the 99.9% up time a big joke. They keep passing the buck when you ask them something or to do something.

          "Contenu": "UPDATE 21-12-21Since this last interaction there have been countless issues. While the platform perfoms adequately with some minor issues the support staff are unable to follow ticket instructions properly. This has set us back a few weeks in our upgrade schedule.UPDATE 07-12-21Although NameHero weren't able to achieve what we originally asked for, they did restore our site back to its original state.The service around this was fast and efficient. Senior staff members did all they could to get the issue resolved as quickly as possible. They were also kind enough to refund our money and added an extra year of hosting which is hugely appreciated!ORIGINAL COMPLAINTNameHero was recommended to us by a blog coach. We did some due diligence by looking for reviews and chatting to some people in forums. The results where impressive and we signed up, moved our web hosting and one of our domains.The website migration went well and thereafter we requested a domain URL change to be done on the staging site first. We mentioned doing this on a staging site 3 times. (We specifically didn't want it done to our live site to avoid potential tech issues.)The charge was $35 (which for us in South Africa is quite a bit of money).Unfortunately NameHero went ahead and changed the domain URL on the live site and it has been pretty much broken in terms of design and internal links since Friday 03 Dec. We sent a list with all the problems we could see and got a response with only one of the issues addressed.   We checked the site and after this first set of \"corrections\" the side bar was not visible anymore.We got in touch yesterday and were told that the matter was escalated. When I got hold of a customer service agent via instant chat today I was told that their Senior Admins only work during business hours.Whilst I do have understanding for a business model that takes care of their staff, I feel that in a case like this one when a website, which is our business, has been compromised by NameHero, then a senior staff member should be available to assist."

Start Now Free, no credit card required, worlds favourite/best/fastest/most loved, 30 day money back guarantee, it's all there. Sounded great, so I signed up for namehero hosting, and had to pay for a year in advance. Thank goodness I didn't choose the 3 year package. Naturally I needed a website, so I  registered buywholesalecannabisseeds.--.--. I started communicating with them about setting up the quic.cloud etc on buywholesalecannabisseeds.-.-. I then set about transferring my income producing site feedaseed.--.-- to their servers. Again, I received assistance from their support staff.  I also bought another domain, bethulierise.-.- Then a week later, with my site having been down, and me eagerly waiting for the domain transfer to complete. I receive a red ABUSE notification, stating that my site is in violation of their Acceptable Use Policy?This policy, hidden at the bottom of the page, prohibits amongst many, many other things CBD and Cannabis related products. Go Figure! I was given 48 hours to remove the offending website. How? We're going to delete your account. Can I get my money Back? No, because their Terms of Use state that if you contravene their, somewhat obscure and disingenuous, Acceptable Use Policy your money belongs to them. No suggestions of an alternative, like we can still honor your hosting for the other  domain you registered with us. Just, we're closing your account and the money is ours. ZAR 1800.00 might not sound like much at $120, but it's not small change in South Africa. It's great to be able to bombard the consumer with Start Now and Start for Free Buttons and other promises but then hide behind a puritanical Acceptable Use Policy and then use that Policy to justify stealing your customers money. Hypocrisy, I say! I am the only one who has been abused. But, I would imagine there have been many others. I would caution any foreigner to do business with companies in the USA. Furthermore, I would caution anyone considering a move to NameHero, not, to carefully read their Acceptable use Policy. Because if you contravene it however innocently they will gladly steal your money."

No problems!\u201d they answered.And we were stupid enough to believe them.Shortly after we started, all my accounts got closed because \u201cI was spamming\u201d (please note that all our mailing-lists \u2014 except the one where people buy a product delivered by mail \u2014 are double opt-in). Now, I had revived a 5 year old list, and I had 30 bounces, so I thought, \u201cokay, that is understandable\u201d.A few weeks later, one more time, all our mail blocked. \u201cWe are spamming\u201d. No, we aren\u2019t. We have self hosted mailing lists and we send mails, mind you.\u201cOh, right, sorry!\u201d\u201cCan you please do something so we don\u2019t get in troubles again?\u201d\u201cYeah, sure!\u201dAnd then, yesterday, one more time: All mails blocked: \u201cYou are spamming!\u201dNo, we\u2019re not! We are working! But this time, almost 24 hours later, our mails are still blocked, we\u2019ve lost some hundred bucks, we tried to contact support again and again and the latest answer is \u201cWe are forwarding your ticket to Abuse department\u201d-Well... we didn\u2019t write any ticket. \u201cAbuse department\u201d was the one contacting us at first and then just got silent, letting us with no solution or anything. The clock is ticking, so are our dollars.Oh, and by the way, in another matter, their support was totally inefficient and unknowledgeable. I couldn\u2019t send mail because it was blocked by Spamhaus. I contacted support who asked me random things, like \u201cSend a mail with full headers\u201d. Me: \u201cHow can I send you headers of a mail I can\u2019t send? There must be a block somewhere on the server\u201d. Support: \u201cNo, it\u2019s your IP\u201d. Me: \u201cNo it\u2019s not, I can send mail from other accounts on same IP. It must be something on the server. I get block before it gets sent\u201d. Support: \u201cNo, it\u2019s your IP\u201d.Result: After spending quite an amount of time searching: There is a switch on the server which set Spamhaus up. I deactivated it and it worked. It was something on the server but support didn\u2019t know.All in all: Don\u2019t go VPS on them, they might cost you a lot and support is amateur at best. Stay away from their VPS-solution."

Went back to see the status of the queue. MY ACCOUNT WAS COMPLETELY CLOSED. 8. I started to understand that what was documented in all the tickets was just a SCAM. Scam, trying to evade $380! Yes guys, they just kept $380 for their business lunches. UAU! 9- After another 2 days of requesting what's the status they opened the account do that I can access the tickets. YES, $380 to be able to access tickets. That meanwhile haven't been answered for 4 days! Finally, what do I need to say...\u200bI don't want to do business with you guys Never again. Why are you keeping my money? Do you really need my $380? So I paid you for 36 months and you canceled the account with 30 months left? Really Ryan?

          "Contenu": "After 30 years of having Register.com hosting my Websites, I decided to change my hosting service when their call center moved completely to the Phillipines. One of my trusted associates recommended Name Hero since I would now be using WordPress for the first time to replace the dreaded Dreamweaver and orphaned Adobe Muse. When I moved my Web Hosting from Register.com to Name Hero, it seemed simple enough. But it was not evident to me that the transfer would move my email service by default to Name Hero. Five days later, my email was cut off by Register.com. It took the better part of two days to fix this, between calling Register.com (Web.com, Network Solutions) Trying to log on to Name Hero was not working because my email address was not recognized as valid. I did not see a customer service phone number on the Name Hero Website. Finally, Register.com customer service supervisor in Nova Scotia found the number and gave it to me. I called and gave the mx code and cName to your agent and my email was restored. 1. My bad for not understanding the email would switch by default and for missing the phone number, but your bad for not displaying it more prominent. 2. This type of problem is typically caused by lack of knowledge by the customer and lack of clear professional explanation by the service provider. Your CEO must know his stuff about your systems and services, but it's time he turned the blogging detail over to a professional communicator."

I get lots of php fatal-errors in my woocommerce journal and website is down 20 times per day. Every time they didn't knew what to do they told me to upgrade and was not the case. I am very upset on the poorly prepared customer support assistants. I lost money in the past 2 months since i am having this issues.If won't get proper support and configuration of the server i will definitely move my websites to another hosting provider.Edit: I am still having issues but at least i can see some improvement in the support system.

The good thing is that they are always replying and very patient with clients.Thanks to all support team members, and special thanks to Arun Paul."

In our free time we can forward questins to your team but what happens to our customers when we are working or sleeping. Still not 100% sure about this part."

          "Contenu": "Servers are fast. Support is next level amazing. Seriously, the best service I have had from a host. I like the backend admin.Room for improvement? Yes. The INODES for \"unlimited\" packages is slightly misleading for un-technical customers like myself. For example: I have purchased the 3 year turbo cloud and it has a hefty 500 000 INODES limit (I discovered after the fact as its not listed in the main price table). I am moving around 20 Wordpress sites to my turbo cloud and over the next 3 years I will likely ad another 10-20.So all in all I might have around 40 Wordpress sites. Now yes that is a lot of Wordpress sites, but it is no where near \"unlimited\". They are all real sites for real clients, no networks, no spam sites. I currently have 13 installed and my INODES usage is already at 100 000. At this rate I will be at 400 000 with Wordpress installs and thats excluding any new posts, new pages, more media uploads, additional plugins etc to all these sites. So I will likely have to pay for an upgrade defeating the savings I wanted to make from moving from my current host to NameHero.So practically for Wordpress this is far from unlimited and for me quite disappointing as I was hoping to be able to use this account for the next 3 years as I paid upfront for it.I understand it's some kind of fair use policy from NameHero's side but unless you understand INODES the \"unlimited websites\" is extremely misleading and far from unlimited.What it should say is. *For Wordpress sites you can have around 40 smaller sites or at a push 10-20 larger sites after that you will have to upgrade to biz cloud or other server. (Which I would have done by the way if I had known).All this said, if not for the INODES I would have given NameHero 5 Stars, as for the price and even compared to more expensive premium WP hosts, the speeds and service are not short of amazing. I highly recommend NameHero as long as you understand INODES."

This isn't the first time a migration didn't go smoothly but, once again, James got me through and I am SO grateful, and for GoToAssist remote technology. Everything needed to be reset, including the ports, as it turns out, which was beyond my knowledge to do. I look forward to enjoying my experience with NameHero. Thank you!

I decided to test the site speed with GTmetrix and achieved my best score ever: a big green capital A with excellent web vitals.  Today it is 10 days later and I ran the GTmetrix speed test again.  The results are still a straight A, but the performance score increased to 100%.  I have 102 published pages on my site and I never saw speeds this fast with my previous two hosting providers.  So far my experience with Namehero has been excellent and I do recommend it for hosting."

She also assisted in updating Cloudflare settings and creating the necessary DNS records. Her explanations were clear, and she ensured that I understood each step.Notably, Anna provided valuable insights on DNS propagation and Cloudflare integration, advising on best practices. Her expertise and dedication simplified what could have been a complex process.In conclusion, NameHero's customer support, exemplified by Anna, is first-rate. This smooth and informative experience earns my highest recommendation."
