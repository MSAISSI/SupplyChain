I have asked to be transferred to another VPS node and they appear to have no process in place to do urgent transfers, so I am waiting for some unknown period of time to hear back from their devops team.

They don't have the knowledge on how to help people moved from slow shared servers to platform i. I've had to contact support multiple times, and the wait time is extremely long. When they email me back they say \"it looks like it is working\" though my dashboard shows clearly it is broken.While Cloudways is more expensive, it is worth it. You get almost instant access to support, and they actually will migrate your site over for free. I still don't get why migration isn't included when you want to upgrade your inmotionhosting account.I used to recommend these guys 10 years ago but the UI/UX hasn't changed much since then expect they added tons more things. Inmotionhosting is obviously behind the times. The fact that their support team and sales team is completely separate shows that they have outdated thinking."

Though the customer service reps/techs are helpful, the issues I have with deliverability are not improving, instead worsening. It has been suggested to me twice now that I use a 3rd-party email provider such as Zoho or Google Workspace to ensure proper deliverability. Fine, but what am I paying InMotion Hosting $215/year for, which includes webhosting and email, when they suggest I use a 3rd-party email provider? Sure, their webhosting is fine, but why am I paying $215/year just to be told to use a a 3rd-party email provider when I contact tech support, only to have them adjust my 'A' records, then send me instructions on how to set up their email service followed by a request for a review? Seems like a slap in the face. InMotion used to be stellar for the for 5 years or so, but now they are far from it. Do better, InMotion."

If, through brute force, my site is spammed with bad emails and I hit a 5/5 per hour deferral limit, my server is shut down. I asked for my limit to be raised and they, the good people in tech support at InMotion, tell me that they have eliminated the limit however I keep seeing this message \"Domain (my domain) has exceeded the max defers and failures per hour (5/5 (100%)) allowed. Message discarded.\" I just got this as I am writing this review. I've lost 100s of thousands of dollars and will be leaving today. I don't believe I am on a dedicated server and I believe that I have been scammed by InMotion hosting. Why else would they be unable or unwilling to raise or remove the deferral limits on the SMTP server?"

I tried to learn what I could do on my end to work out the problems.I did well until Inmotion Hosting cut back on the Technical Dept and the ability to talk to techs. As time went on when you could reach a Tech they seem to become less knowledgeable.Today I left Inmotion and moved all my sites. I'm not saying whom I moved to but it is far less expensive and I found using the Account Management much easier at the new hosting company. My money site has to be built from the ground up because the htaccess was edited by a tech months ago. When I complained to him he just brushed it off with, \"It will work out any problems on it's own. The backups didn't go back far enough to overcome his mistake. I knew the day would come I would have to rebuild it. I started to rebuild today. Made for a good time to change host and not look back."

The Inmotion support manager told us that due to the seriousness of the situation he should consult with his superiors, but that in any case they were going to contact us in a few days, until today, October 23, we have no response or any recognition For damages. Not a free month, not a refund, not an apology."

Whenever you reach out to them for the issues such as these they will tell you that it's outside the scope of their help. Please contact your developer. I am extremely disappointed and sick of their excuses and this has been happening to my blogs for almost a year. It doesn't bother them at all. Why would it? I wish i could show you the screenshot of a white screen here but there is no way to attach it here. The white screen clearly says to contact your hosting. After getting fed up of their excuses i decided to write this review because everyone has a breaking point."

I had to get in touch with support before it magically activated. The next day, the webservers had several HOURS of downtime. This was reported in both US and Europe, so it wasn't just me. I then had trouble editing with remote FTP. I tried a few different extensions in VS Code, but none worked well. Spent a long time setting up SSH just to figure out that there is some kind of caching on the webserver. So when I made a change to a file (PHP, CSS or whatever) it would take around 60 seconds before it was reflected in the browser. There is no way you can do any kind of development or debugging under these conditions. Support chat is sloooow, but they told me that caching can't be turned off with the \"core\" plan. This explains why FTP seemingly didn't work either. I just threw in the towel and requested a refund after two days with nothing but trouble and wasted time. InMotion Hosting was a horrible experience from start to finish."

Neither agent resolved my issue and the first agent rushed me off the chat after telling me there is nothing else that can be done as I was pointing my A record to another domain. However, that was not true and I eventually resolved the issue on my own after hours of researching it online. It required additional DNS and email setting changes which both agents could have walked me through. Another example of a recent issue is when all their emails kept going to my spam folder even after I whitelisted them. I reached out to them about it via email and they replied that they were aware of the issue. I never heard back from them since then even after following up. I know a representative reading this review will ask me to follow up with them but this is not acceptable! Their support team needs to be trained better in being responsive and taking time to resolve issues carefully. Though, I doubt they will as this seems to be a recurring issue based on other older reviews."

More important is that once every few weeks an email I send to a customer is refused due to a blacklist IP address. I've talked to customer support about these issues. Their advice: wait an hour and try again since we cycle IP addresses every hour. Yesterday and today I had an email to a customer refused three times. I had to send it from a gmail account. I asked inmotion customer support if there was any way to get improved email and they said I should move my business email to another host, but keep my domain a web server at inmotion. This is unacceptable, so I'm forced to move. Other than the email issues I'm very happy with inmotion.

I'd had websites hosted in the US before, after all, and they worked just as wel as servers in Europe.Boy was I wrong. I don't know if inmotion messed up the migration (which I paid for), or horribly oversold the server I was on, but speeds were atrocious. I'm talking dialup speeds. The kind of speed that means it now takes a full minute to open a simple WordPress website.When I complained about this, inmotion blamed both the distance from the US to Europe and my ISP. Both are absolute nonsense, as I'm now with another hosting provider in North America, and I'm getting speeds literally sixty times faster.In the process of moving away from inmotion, they tried to prevent my exit every way the could. In a support conversation, they repeatedly pretended I hadn't told them how I wanted to download the website backup they offered to create for me, and when I repeatedly reminded them of the fact that that information was in the first message, they stopped replying.Had they not lied to me, and had they made the exit a bit more graceful, I might have been interested in the European servers location they plan to offer, but with service like this, inmotion is a hosting provider I'd avoid like the plague."

I called in their service, and being put on waiting for over 1 hr while the guy was doing his research...After a few more attempts, I was being told they were aware of this phishing email issue and managed to contained some but unfortunately some of their clients' still received the phishing attack... The solution - you have to spent your time and money to get this taken care of.... I have the ticket # s recorded to proofs of the claim. Ticket # 6316279, 6316086. and all the emails. And my website is being heavily hacked, and I have to spend hours and hours to clean up all this messs.I will have to look for some other services soon unforutnately, and I hope you can learn from my experience and be cautious if you are looking into this company. Your loyalty means little to their time and money. That is what I learned in a hard way after over 8 years being with them."

I reached out to their sales chat to inquire about their web hosting plans, and the sales agent, Danny, claimed to have 13 years of experience but exhibited shockingly unprofessional behavior. I asked a simple question about whether their shared hosting supports Imunify360 + CloudLinux + LiteSpeed, and he couldn't provide a straightforward answer, insisting that I needed to buy a VPS and even shared a link to an official license buying site. He adamantly denied that such features were available in shared hosting plans, demonstrating a lack of knowledge. This encounter left me with no desire to proceed with a purchase, as I believe that if this is how they treat potential customers before making a payment, their post-payment support is likely to be just as disappointing. Despite multiple attempts to communicate clearly, I received nothing but rude and unhelpful responses from Danny. I frequently see their ads on Facebook, and while I had planned to make a purchase, this experience has solidified my decision to steer clear of InMotion Inc hosting. My review may not encompass all of the details, but it reflects the unprofessionalism and lack of communication I encountered during my interaction with their sales representative. This is truly one of the worst experiences I've had in my 16 years of web development."

          "Contenu": "I have been with inMotion for 6 years and always kept my account fully updated. Initially I was on their VPS, which was satisfactory at the time. I've since upgraded to a dedicated server. I was never told that I would lose all customer support when I made this move. I'm not just talking about technical assistance support, I mean any kind of friendliness or professionality from customer support. As soon as I mention it's dedicated support literally tells me they don't want to help me with anything. I paid for 2 x 2TB SSD with my dedicated plan. I realised after a year that they didn't give me the second one. No apologies, in fact they almost didn't help me install the second 2TB, after much struggle that was added for me. No refund, discount or apology. A few months ago I changed from a monthly plan to a 6-monthly plan. Just before my this new plan was up for renewal I requested to change back to a monthly plan. I was told it was changed, but I kept checking and it hadn't been. 3 days after my term lapsed they suspended my server. Forget that I was waiting for them to fix my plan, who suspends a subscription after 3 days of non-pay for a loyal client of 6 years? My server was suspended for almost a day, again no apologies and they eventually said they would fix my subscription by 6 March and would keep my account from suspension until it's fixed. It was suspended once in that time but at least not for long (although it required some more support struggles). I fortunately followed up on 2 March (I had to continually follow-up as they didn't send me any updates on the situation). They then told me that my server will be suspended on 6 March, they can't change my plan back to monthly and they can't extend it more, they can't help to migrate to another package, they can't do anything and I will lose everything in 4 days time. Again, no apology, no assistance, no support, no customer service. I was grateful to move to a better unmanaged dedicated server with better hardware, better systems, and excellent service. These weren't my first problems with them but it will be the last. If they at least apologised or pretended to care but they have shown me the door and I gladly took it."

          "Contenu": "My website hosting service, InMotion Hosting, has totally failed me with this website. I have been a customer for over 10 years. For most of those years, the few tech times I needed tech support, it was provided within 24 hours. Recently, one day suddenly almost 2 years of posts were missing on my website. This included posts, pages, categories, and even media files. I contacted tech support 4 TIMES IN 4 days before they even responded to my tech support questions. When they finally did respond, the answers only addressed some of the questions. It felt like it was a canned answer without any real thought or problem solving going into the response.I then responded with a request that they answer the questions of how this very selective deletion of posts, media files, pages and categories could have happened, and 5 DAYS LATER I finally received a response. IT TOOK 9 DAYS TOTAL TO GET THEIR OFFICIAL DIAGNOSIS ON THE PROBLEM. How is that acceptable for any business?Tech support claimed that there was an SQL database error and that they restored it to June 2020. However, that does not explain how media files after that date were affected.It is my belief (though I do not have evidence) that InMotion is joining other tech platforms and is engaging in censorship of content that does not fit the \u201cofficial narrative\u201d.  InMotion claims that they do not censor.Yet, the very selective nature of the deleted content suggests strongly that this was done by the hosting service, as a hacker would not go to such trouble to be so selective. Those who have followed my site know that there was never any violent, racist, graphic, or other inappropriate content here.  If I was depending on InMotion for income, this entire fiasco would have been a disaster. Gratefully, I do not depend on the website for income, but losing 2 years of work is so frustrating, and then having the lack of response, and then the weak tech support responses when I did get them is unacceptable.Personally, I cannot recommend that anyone use InMotion Hosting as a service."

By the way, the issue was caused by Inmotion Hosting migrating my site to a new VPS server, and making changes to allow for HTTP/2. Once the changes were made, permission on my site changed, and the website crashed. My developer cannot do anything until Inmotion Hosting changes the permissions, and that request has now been nearly 1 week and still not done. What has happened to the stellar tech support that Inmotion Hosting used to have? Something in the company has changed: bad tech support, highly increased fees, and seemingly no way to get things expedited efficiently. I am looking for a new host now, what a huge hassle."

I woke this morning to find the server had been down 6 hrs and it's still down more than another 6 hrs later.  All support says is you're in the queue to be looked at and there is no timetable for that.  Wow.  We can't afford to have this ever happen again and will be looking for a new host soon that cares about their most important customers.UPDATE: After 18 hrs of downtime I finally got someone to be proactive and try to resolve the issue and get systems admin to look as well.  After 30 min of looking they determined that it couldn't be fixed and we'd have to migrate to a new server.  We're now down nearly 36 hrs and estimated a full 2 days of downtime or more at this point.  No real since of urgency or priority was given to us as a long time dedicated server customer.  I'll be reaching out to customer loyalty once it's all said and done."

When we contacted support about this, we were told that they can increase their prices whenever they like and that all customers got the same increase. We stuck with this old server, because the costs fit our budget, but had paid extra to get upgrades on it, such as memory and sn additional hard drive, despite really needing something better, but now with being treated like this after so many years, we are also actively looking elsewhere!  If we have no choice but to pay DOUBLE for a crappy machine, we may as well find another company that will give us a better server!BTW they are STILL advertising their legacy servers from $79.99 pcm! Clearly they dont need the business because I'm guessing most customers that have been faced with 100% increase will go elsewhere."

          "Contenu": "It\u2019s been frustrating. To start with, I was given conflicting advice over the sequence in which to migrate the domain registration and the hosting. First I was told to move the hosting first. Then I was told to move the domain first.Then I found out that it wasn\u2019t possible for your guys to move the email because of the way GoDaddy and Microsoft between them have locked it away from the outside. I verified this was true, but it was disappointing. So I figured out how to export the contents of my email, but I was still left with the problem of updating the name servers. It seems your guys can\u2019t do that either. I understand that GoDaddy will do everything possible to keep hold of the account (except give me the service that I want), but it leaves me in a bad place.I just found a place on the GoDaddy site that describes moving the domain registration. It gives a sequence of steps:Domain transfer checklist:\u2022\tMake sure your administrative contact email is current. (It's where we send your transfer authorization code.)\u2022\tVerify that the new registrar will set up your DNS zone files. If you don't do this, your website and email could go down.\u2022\tStart the domain transfer at your new registrar. (We email you to ensure you requested the transfer.)\u2022\tAuthorize the transfer with your new registrar. (Use the transfer authorization code we email you when you're done here.)\u2022\tWe email you confirmation when your transfer completes, usually not more than 5-7 days.Of these things, the only one that makes sense to me is the first one. What I had hoped to do was pay your $200 fee to make all the rest happen, but so far the only answer I\u2019ve gotten is that I have to do it all. And I don\u2019t know how.Grrr.I want to give a shout-out to Donnie B, who sent me a \u201chow to\u201d description of what needs doing, but I\u2019m too intimidated (so far) to try it. If you guys are unable to make magic happen on your end, I would be willing to pay the fee to have someone hold my hand through the process of doing what I have to do on this end, but I\u2019m past the stage in life where I want to dig through arcane instruction manuals. The downside of screwing up my email (even more than GoDaddy has already screwed it up), is just too great. I love my website, but it is trivial compared to the email.Aren\u2019t you glad you asked?Mary Ellena"

I find myself reaching out to tech support more frequently, especially in the last several months. The quality of support steadily decreased, but tonight was the first time my situation went unresolved. Although tech support has been helpful, I find getting things resolved takes a lot longer and frequently; it has been the same problem. Tonight, I just got offline with tech support, disappointed. Though the tech person was attentive, my situation is unresolved. He politely informed me they are not developers, and I will need to work it out. He shared an article where he found information on my problem. This request has been a recurring issue, and the last time, although I was online for an extended period, that rep could help resolve the issue. Now, I've wasted about 45 minutes and I still have the same problem.  I should have taken a clue a couple of days ago when I went into the AMP panel to purchase a new domain, and saw that my monthly hosting plan increased with no notification. They were just going to charge my card. I was told they rarely notify those on monthly plans and offered a discount to continue at my same cost. I decided not to purchase the domain with Inmotion and have begun to explore other hosting companies.Tonight's experience is confirmation that it's time to find another hosting company.Inmotion Hosting has lost its way and customer service seems to be an after-thought. I can no longer in good conscience recommend Inmotion Hosting."

In fact this is directly from their current website:\"InMotion Hosting is a privately-owned technology company providing web hosting, cloud-based solutions and managed services to businesses and entrepreneurs across the globe. With over 170,000 customers, our mission is to bring tools, platforms and outstanding customer service within anyone\u2019s reach to transform their online presence. Since 2001, we have built our foundation around 24/7/365 U.S.-based customer support, exceptional web hosting, and new product development leveraging open source technology.\"Why is this still on their website? This was their biggest draw. Their support staff were fantastic. For the past week, I have been trying to pay my bill. When I go to pay my bill, it says \"contact us\". Very funny. You can't. Chat is inoperable. When you try, you get an auto message from yes, a contractor, the dreaded Zen Desk.  Zen Desk confirmed In Motion no longer offers 24/7 365 day support. Wow! How professional! Thanks for telling us, your customers! Way to go! Now my business is totally offline, I can't get my client's emails and I can't even pay my bill!  Love the reaching out to tell us that now they don't offer the same level of service. Oops. Guess we forgot to tell you. So sorry. (You might be sorry per some complaints to be filed).Our livelihoods are on the web. Period.  You can't have a hosting company that is non-responsive because for many of us, time off line is time off business. My bet? They were bought by an equity trading firm and now we are stuck with America's new version of a \"company\". Invisible \"owners\". Fired staff replaced by call centers. Terrible to no REAL customer service. Minimal engagement as long as they have your credit card number. Sad. They used to be a great hosting service. I hope I am wrong but I bet I'm not. We need legislation in this country to define what a \"company\" is because the current definition pretty much constitutes a fraud on all of us."

Go figure.Moving away now to another, smaller host."

They told me that they had given us a new machine 2 weeks ago and had told us that we don\u2019t need to do any changes. After 2 weeks, which is today, our website and database is down, causing us to loose thousands of dollars. It was all due to that Inmotion failed to inform (via email or call) us to change our DNS records (we were told by Inmotion that the IP wouldn\u2019t change and we don\u2019t have to update any records). The support agent was very rude. When I asked to speak to his manager, he put me on hold and asked me to wait for 2-3 minutes. I waited for 10 minutes and had to hang up without ever being answered by a manager. Didn\u2019t get a call from them afterward either! If things remain this way, I might use another company \u2014 horrible!"

At first the impression was good.Recently I have lost my databases, everything, my whole livelihood is gone. Support wasn't able to help me and I got no explanation about the causes. My databases, my websites, my content is all gone suddenly.An external hosting professional suggested that it must have been their fault, I will probably never know. Without getting into technical details, I now have no access to over 25 websites I had that ranked and had traffic. InmotionHosting did not even offer me another server as the current one is clearly compromised (wordpress installs with their toolkit don't work). Very negative experience and I would advise anyone to stay far far away from Inmotion, they are not worth it. It is not about the $1,000 I paid yearly.Partially it is my fault as I had no active backups but on the other hand, when I signed up they did not have backup as an additional service and now they do. A support staff told me it was 6 months ago they introduced that. Service went down noticeably in the past years. The reason I gave them 2 stars instead of the 1 that they deserve is because the support staff responds fast when you are dealing with simple issues."

From day one, my website was experiencing very slow  load times and it was not passing the Google PageSpeed Insights, giving the website a poor grade there for server response. It had on average a reading of over 3 seconds for server response and sometimes much bigger, a normal value should be of less than 1 sec. This is the time it takes for the server to respond to the initial page request and deliver the initial html file.I contacted support and they said there was nothing wrong with the server and the speed was fine on some other test tools they provided.I switched to a similar plan at Bluehost.com, and moved my website there. I did the Google speed test again, and it was perfect. It passed the test with a high score of 97 out of 100. So, clearly, there is an issue with Inmotion hosting. The new installation at Bluehost was 100% identical to the one at InMotion Hosting, but the server response time at Bluehost was much faster.I cancelled at Inmotion Hosting and got a full refund. Their customer support is ok, but they were not able to help solve the server response time problem. So i don't recommend them. I recommend Bluehost. The price is the same, and your website will load much faster, which is important if you want good Google search rankings."

          "Contenu": "I've been a customer of InMotion for over 5 years, and in that time have had a relatively good experience. However, within the last 6 months or so, I've noticed some serious deterioration across the board. It started with spontaneous drop-outs in my hosting; never anything more than 5 minutes, but still, if they're doing SCHEDULED maintenance, they could at least send out automated emails to let customers know they can expect an outage between the hours of __ and __ or something - just a courteous 'heads up' would be better than nothing.While that is permissible, the customer service experience isn't. In the past, I've never had to wait more than a minute or 2 (if at all) to be connected to a knowledgeable rep who could handle my issue quickly and courteously. In the last 6 months, I've experienced quite the opposite: interminably long queues for a rep (they are always 'experiencing higher than normal support requests' now), and when the rep does come online (which could be after anywhere from 15 to 45+ minute waits), they have been rushed, rude, and somewhat inept at providing adequate answers.The only reason they get 2 stars is because of the great service in the past. I will be migrating all my hosted domains to Siteground (who has AMAZING customer service) and recommending clients do the same as subscriptions expire this year."

But I have very simple site! I asked support and received answer - ask developer - our system works without problems. I written many mails to support and last mail from support said: We made all - you must buy VPS. Cool! After I sent angry mail and support moved my site from this host to new and voila - time to load less 1 sec! After moving I had problems with mails etc., because they only moving, didn't make changes in system, but this is little things compared with big time to load.\r2 case: I moved site from different hosting provider. At different hosting provider site worked properly. But, at inmotionhosting I have problems with sending mails from contact form. Problem with smtp auth, at inmotionhosting it doesn't work correct. Again I had many mails from support about contact developer; my mail boxes wrong; not correct, because they system don't determine names of my mail boxes, etc. But support agree that smtp auth problem at hosting end. Nice answer from support: you must use forwarder with same real mailbox only (but at  cPanel docs written - it is not necessarily, i.e. support from inmotionhosting does not read docs). Final answer - we made all - you must buy VPS!"

          "Contenu": "I started with InMotion because the reviews I read at the time from major tech blogs gave inMotion good ratings. My needs were a reliable VPS to host multiple websites. The first month or two was good and support promptly responded to my support requests until a problem with PHP-FPM. The PHP-FPM service would stop responding affecting ALL sites on the VPS. None of the sites on the VPS were able to load php web pages. After 5-15 minutes the server would recover and the sites would start loading php web pages again. This process would repeat every 2-3 hours.Tech support could not solve the issue and blamed me. I came up with my own temporary solutions by using a cron job to restart the PHP-FPM service every 15 minutes.Tech support applied a NGINX configuration to my VPS but it was not setup correctly because every site on the VPS would not load. Tech support could not resolve that issue so I had them roll back the config changes.Finally, about a week ago I was again faced with all of the sites on my VPS not loading. I contacted support and they claimed that the firewall was changed. They couldn't tell me when or how the firewall was changed. They attempted to blame me and accused me of changing the firewall. Eventually, they claimed to have reinstalled the firewall... and my sites were loading again. They did not open port 22 for ssh so I have to open another support ticket to get port 22 opened...Technical support has been a complete failure and disappointment. After multiple arguments with support they finally agreed to refund the prepaid service I haven't used. I am in the process of migrating to AWS now."

My clients were often annoyed waiting for time sensitive material from me.

However, we encountered an issue with email delivery and reached out to their support for assistance. Initially, they promptly acknowledged the problem, attributing it to an email delivery issue with the Outlook client. They assured us that the issue had been resolved. Regrettably, after a few days, the problem resurfaced. Upon contacting their support once again, we were informed that we had two options: either endure prolonged delays in email delivery, occasionally lasting up to 24 hours, or procure external email hosting services such as Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace. This response was profoundly disappointing, given that we had invested in their highest tier of hosting."

Therefore, I no longer recommend them. They seem only too happy to take your money, but then fail to supply a reliable service. In the past they used to guarantee a 99.9% uptime for all service levels offered, and lo and behold they no longer offer this (I wonder why; because they are failing to meet the level of availability they used to guarantee). The 99.9% uptime guarantee is now only available on their Pro offerings. I will not be renewing my contract with them as I get better uptime when running my own physical severs on my own internet connections!UPDATE: They have now moved my site to a new server... and lo and behold, no more outages! I still won't be renewing my contract when it expires, as the level of support is not as good as it used to be."

          "Contenu": "I've been with InMotion Hosting since 2015. I started out with the Shared Hosting Pro. Things were fine up until I started an e-commerce store with Shared Hosting Pro. The minute I switched all of the sudden the server was SLOOOOOOOOW as molasses. Due to the fact that I never had an issue in the past with them, I decided, well....maybe it's time to bump up to VPS. I got a VPS 4GB VPS server. After I got the VPS server, the website was much faster with an extremely noticeable difference. Which I was happy about. The only issue I have, is they sign you up for $19.99 per month when you pay for a year in advance and the next year you bump up to $59.99 per month. The transfer appeared to be seamless, up until one of my WordPress websites for my creative agency wasn't fully working. There is a 500 internal server error for the portfolio pages only. I tried to get support and they said it was a portfolio plugin that wasn't active, however that wasn't the issue, because it was a plugin from an old theme. I then paid for Softaculous, which if you know you're way around cPanel, then you know what that is and how handy it comes in for many things. When that was installed I had to go back again after they installed it to have them add all the software, features and scripts.When I wanted to use one of the two dedicated IP's they promised upon signing up for VPS, I asked for a dedicated IP and the representative asked me why? I have never been asked that before when using a dedicated IP and that's kind of a question that is self-explanatory by itself if you know anything about websites, design and development. The sites I run, I want running on a dedicated IP because I don't want to risk any reputation issues if someone on a shared IP isn't following rules that will affect sites in many different ways if you're not careful. The reason I bring that up is they forgot to add that when they created the account. Then there were all kinds of DNS issues that were popping up when I got the new IP address. It was bringing up a site that was installed on a different domain. I burned 1.5 days dealing with that. It was kind of ridiculous how long it took to deal with that. I had changed IP's on Cloudflare to match the new IP address. What wound up happening is DNS records weren't synched by the rep that I was working with to help the the dedicated IP and to match records so the DNS worked as it should.All in all, I would say if you have VPS, you should call in. The reps don't cover everything when you make requests via chat or try to get help via chat. InMotion also MISSED A LOT on the server transfer. I was kind of disappointed. I almost switched over to Dotblock even though they are more expensive. I've worked with them before and their customer service and tech support are stellar. If you're listening InMotion Hosting, you should be consider being more fair in the end with pricing. $19.99 for the first year and boosting it up to $59.99 is a bit much. I'd also say you should definitely work with your employees to make sure bases are covered on tech issues. That would relieve other reps from having to deal with follow ups from previous requests that haven't been fully resolved."

          "Contenu": "I\u2019ve been with InmotionHosting for 5 years, and have 12 dedicated CC2000 servers with them (their biggest dedicated server package). So I can speak as a dedicated hosting customer, but not as a shared hosting customer. Since I\u2019ve communicated with their dedicated tech support over 100+ times  over the last 5 years, I\u2019ve gotten to know half of them by name, and I have a really good pulse on what\u2019s going on support wise. Initially (five years ago) this company was really excellent. The servers were setup quickly, tech support was fast, reliable, and proficient. It was a small team as the calls always got answered by the same people in the tech support team. Managed hosting had an even higher, dedicated, and quality team. Most importantly however, the System Administration team (the team that\u2019s actually at the server location, maintaining the servers) has always responded Extremely Fast. Any issues with the server hardware or anything else that made the server unreachable by the tech support team was handled very well. When something goes truly wrong - that\u2019s the only guys that can bring your server back to life. Unfortunately, over the years, as I\u2019ve watched the company dramatically grow in size, there has has been a steady decline in tech support. Support started to take longer to reach, and then all the familiar voices started to go away. They\u2019ve either moved to other pastures or the team has started to expand in size, or both. The team slowly got replaced by newer, less experienced team members. Tech support wait times took an hour sometimes, so I had to resort to chat only, which sometimes would have 14 people in que anyway. Inmotion did respond to this increase in demand and recently wait times have been restored to less than a few minutes, which is great. As of right now, July 2022, tech support is back to very good. Wait times are minimal, and even though the team is much less experienced, they do care and try to get the job done for you. My main concern, and really the main reason we will be moving our servers elsewhere is because the System Administration team (the team maintaining your physical server) is clearly a Major issue at Inmotion. We have recently had 2 of our servers go down due to separate hardware failures. After calling support and opening tickets for the System Admin team to maintain the servers, it\u2019s been 24 hours and the tickets haven\u2019t even been opened by the team yet. This used to (and should) take less than an hour. Repeated calls don\u2019t help. Escalating the issue to a manager or a supervisor is impossible. It doesn\u2019t matter if you have a CC2000 or your server has been down for days, or 100k visitors are being lost hourly, or if you\u2019ve been a customer for a long time. It\u2019s important to note It\u2019s not really the tech supports fault, they are still excellent.Ultimately, most hosting companies are the same when everything is working fine. What you\u2019re paying for is for the support when something goes wrong. At this point, it seems that Inmotion is unable to keep up with the growth demand they have, and we can\u2019t afford to wait for them to address these issues. So while it\u2019s been a good ride - we\u2019ll be moving somewhere else. Thanks Inmotion!"

No automatic backups on server level, extra memory and storage are very expensive. Still a good choice if the basic configuration is good enough."

In defense of InMotion, they are not the only web hosting company that has cut back technical help to increase profits. Sadly customers are the ones affected."

Also, the difficult reCaptcha is an extremely large hinderance when logging in to AMP, adding additional time before I'm able to access my account.

There should be one rate for one plan. Yes, of-course there can be channel promotions or other affiliate discounts, etc. however once someone signs-up with inmotionhosting, they should be offered the same price (with discounts) at renewal as being offered to a new sign-up. I would have rated 3, however the customer support is very helpful so it's +1 for them.It's not a perfect 5 because of company policy!"

The quality of service has been almost always excellent. There have been some \"technicians\"  I've had to deal with that lack sufficient expertise and/or communication skills for my satisfaction. So, they're not perfect. Over the years, accessibility to sup[port has become more time-consuming and less 100% sure of resolution, particularly with the first contact. Nonetheless, I've yet to find any compelling reason to change. More than anything, I'm consistently surprised and the length support staff will go to help me (when they understand my problem and have some sense of how to fix it.) THAT's customer service, and THAT's what I'm really paying for."

While the price was a bit higher than the other hosting companies, I kept coming back to the security and superior customer support. The person I spoke to over the phone was not only courteous, but we'll versed in what I am trying to accomplish online. He helped me choose the best plan and even helped me understand more of what I'd be getting with inMotion. Once I signed up (super easy and no additional fees) I quickly learned that my decision was absolutely correct. The platform is easy to understand and the service is FAR SUPERIOR to most other hosting companies. (Some don't even have a phone number!!) Not only that, their security is unreal and my WordPress sites perform BETTER than my straight HTML sites which surprised me. Overall the speed is crazy fast and the servers are top notch. InMotion Hosting definitely has earned a lifetime customer!"

          "Contenu": "We have used InMotion hosting for 10 years. We started on their VPS server plan and moved up to dedicated. We've hosted about 100 websites with them over that time. We've literally tried every big hosting company in the US for the 10 years before InMotion. Once we got to InMotion, there were absolutely no errors with any of our servers. We also ran about 30 websites on AWS on a Linux environment for people that requested to be on AWS. Within about 6 months of this, all of the sites disappeared one day. The next day, on a different location of servers, another client's website disappeared. We running another instance for him on his own account. And 2 days later, another one, on a server in Europe. Must have been some updates to the server by said company, which we had nothing to do with. Fortunately we had backups for everyone, and quickly got them back up and running. And after that, we migrated them to InMotion, all of them. But the moral of that story is the grass ain't greener on the other side. And some companies don't accept responsibility, which is unbelievable. InMotion takes care of us almost every day. I manage other clients on their servers. They run their own dedicated managed servers, so i can chat with InMotion and take care of anything. Usually, it's security related - some hackers or DDoS attacks. They get on chat quickly and they are always resolving any problems. The server admins really know their stuff. I know they do because I've had some bad ones from other companies over the years. These guys have been great. We wouldn't have used them for the last 10 years if they weren't."
