Instruction Note 5 would have been a perfect place for it. The graphic for Note 5 is really insufficient to clearly communicate how it works.

From the way that the product was packaged to the way it fit was very impressive to me.... I've tried a number of different screen protectors from a number of different manufacturers, but never had a great experience with any of them. The Tech Armor protector fit like a glove and by far, gave me the best fit of any one I have ever tried up to this point.Going forward, I will definitely start using the Tech Armor line of screen protectors for any new phones I get or for stretching out older phones I've been happy using for a while."
