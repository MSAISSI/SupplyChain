          "Contenu": "Well I order 2 separate order for Samsung nvme drive 1tb, they had them priced for 49.99 ,from 79.99, I purchased 3 total , 2 in the first order,  1 in 2nd order, recieved a email at 10:40am saying \"Hello David,Apologies--we had to cancel your order as there was a pricing error on that item.Mike, FounderGamertech.shop\" Now I personally own my own business and and constantly quoting jobs for my customers,  and yes I have made mistakes before, and have to own them.. I have never screwed the customer because of my mistake,  I had a lot of respect for this company before, so much so that when a psu i ordered from them came in and was left in a hell of a rainstorm buy the delivery company, so they( gamertech) did a insurance claim on it for me and I ask them to out the refund it on gift cards cause I knew I would shop here again. So not only was my power supply ruined, my money refund went to them\"per my request\"  that is what these purchases were actually made with. But now they have nothing I needed except those above listed items, so now they get to keep my refund money,  and won't let me spend ,even if it was there mistake.. just saying think wiser than I did and choose who you shop with , maybe a bigger company that honors their mistake is the way to go. Hopefully someone can learn from my mistakes on who to shop with.."

Everything arrived in about one week in perfect, new condition, so I'm happy.  I ordered these items at about midnight, and then sent an email early the next morning asking if they could add a strimer to my order - the shipping cost would have gone from about $18. to about $18.50.  My email was never answered, and the original items were sent.  So now if I order the strimer, the shipping cost is over $15.  I screwed up, but to this day, a couple of weeks later, they never answered my email.  I'll eventually get the strimer on Amazon."

They upgraded the shipping and kept me up to date with the order. Still waiting on a few components from other vendors so I won't be opening the fans for another 1-2 weeks. Hopefully everything is in working condition when I start building the PC. But as it stands, will definitely be using gamertech.shop for future orders.EDIT: Customer service is amazing! Chatted in with a question about my order and was responded to very quickly. I then had a general question about my new (and first) pc build and Mike was quick to offer his help. We hopped on the phone and continued our conversation there. These guys are truly amazing!!"

So when I found out I had this issue with my card, I was shitting bricks to keep it short. But within minutes of me emailing GamerTech they got back to me with a solution to contact Sapphire and they would replace it. They did not, and told me to go back and talk to GamerTech about getting a replacement model. I was even more scared I was gonna be stuck with this $1200 paperweight. But again within minutes of emailing GamerTech they responded. Offering me another card because they where out of XTX's at that time. Long story short they gave me an upgraded model the ASRock RX 7900 XTX Taichi OC for no extra charge and made me feel that they cared if I was happy with my purchase and not left out to dry."

I ended up with the asus tuf model of 4080 from gamertech.shop  which had it up for sale at the same price(after tax) that I would get a non reference 7900xtx. I was only just able to install it last night, but for example playing spiderman miles morales from my 2080ti I was set at 2560x1440 res at high settings with raytracing off and getting relatively smooth performance. With tuf 4080 it reset resolution 4k, turned graphics to custom with everything maxed, raytracing on, and was extremely smooth gameplay. The sting of paying  so much for a graphics cards was lessened by this friendly and knowledgeable salesman here at gamertech.shop. He contacted with answers very quickly and always was above the norm when I was asking questions or requiring assistance from him. I will be shopping from them again in the future."

          "Contenu": "I originally pre ordered the new Lian Li SL120 Infinity fans in black for my new pc build, but after a few days decided to go with an all white build instead. I inquired with GamerTech about canceling and reordering the white fans instead. Mike canceled/refunded my order and allowed me to get the white fans although the pre orders had closed....amazing!  Most places would tell you \"too bad\" or \"sorry can't do anything for you\", this wasn't the case with GamerTech. I was absolutely blown away by their customer service ( I work in the hospitality/ tourism industry, so I know all about customer service and satisfaction) so much that I immediately ordered the new Lian Li Strimer v2 24pin and dual 8 pin cables on the 4th of July and lo and behold, shipped the very next morning (today July 5th) Just an incredible vendor and will be doing many more orders via GamerTech!!"
