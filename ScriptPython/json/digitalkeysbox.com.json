          "Contenu": "This is a scam.  I don't know where all those positive reviews came from, but I think they wrote the reviews themselves.  I bought Office Professional 2019 from them, and while it installed fine, it only worked for a month - it appears it was a trial copy only good for 30 days, and then most functionality in programs is limited.  I tried reloading, no luck. Tried calling, but their phone #'s are not valid.  Online link wouldn't work, phone to Microsoft said it was not a valid code.  Tried emailing digitalkeysbox.com, never received an answer.My review will not change - it's amazing how they contacted me a few hours after the bad review posted, but it took them a few DAYS to respond to me sending them an email with my problem.  I doubt they ever would have responded to my original email if I hadn't posted a bad review.  In addition, their response to my review looks like a standard response that I have seen sent to others with a bad review of them.  I also don't think they read my review because it was working, and I did try the phone option with Microsoft."

There was a choice to upgrade to 2019 Pro for $7 more dollars that included everything.  I declined and proceeded to download.  The download was taking way too long and I noticed the Pro version was being downloaded with crap I didn't want on my computer like One Drive and Skype.  It took hours to remove them.  2019 isn't a very good product to begin with and 2010 version much easier to use.  Lesson learned in dealing with these types of businesses.  Don't buy from this company.  I gave it two stars because the programs work and didn't mess up my computer too bad.  I'm still trying to get all of One Drive off."

          "Contenu": "I question those 5 star reviews.  The product downloaded fine and installed on a Windows 10 machine.  Product key did not work.  Message is the limit has been reached on the number on time the key could be used.  I tried several times online and by phone.  Emailed the different email addresses four times. Received one reply (from a different email address from the one to  which I was told to write).  They said a response with a solution would come in 10-12 hours.  No emails after that.  Days later here I am.  I called the phone number twice (no answer once and the call spoke a message that the line had been disconnected. The other time it rang and rang.  Of course, they have my money.   Notice the response to negative reviews is that the buyer is at fault.  I did everything correctly. I am not a novice.UPDATE  6 days after initial purchase:I heard from DigitalKeysBox. I was sent a 2nd product key and which allowed me to activate the software. (This was sent from the email address pcsoftmail.sale). The email asked what I meant that the key did not work? Also told me to follow the instructions.  Since I had already used the 2nd activation key and had successfully activated my software I ignored the email.  I received another email from the same address which asked me to EDIT (not amend or update) my initial review, which I am doing now. So, all is well now from my side. There is a bit more to the story, but I will spare everyone."

          "Contenu": "I had a number of pre-purchase questions that the chat operator patiently and politely answered. She confirmed that this is a Retail license (though incorrectly said that the ISO would be included in the download, otherwise 5 stars). If you need to chat, be patient, stay on the line and don't rely on the estimated wait time.Installation went smoothly. MS license verification tool confirmed that it was a Retail channel license. It also lists a Retail(Grace) channel license that has now expired. I suspect it is to allow 5 days for adding your license key or a temporary free version of Office 365 that MS wants you to buy. You can find the product for a few dollars less elsewhere but comments on many of those providers talk about how the key failed and they had to work with the seller to (hopefully) get a valid replacement key. My install was hassle free the first time."

It can't be redeemed.\"I emailed support at their email listed, and I was sent a response the following day saying that I needed to log into my Microsoft account, but I had already done that and sent screen shots.  Then they did not respond again to my email when telling them it didn't work so they could aid in trouble shooting.  I emailed them again and am waiting for a response.A few days ago I tried to call their support number 585-666-0760, but that number is no longer in service.  So I turned to the chat.  In the end, the representative just told me to wait for an email because the rep didn't know what to do.The only reason I am giving them any stars is because I placed an order with them several years ago and it worked well.  This time, I am having issues with the key they provided, and they are not responsive."

It's a one-time purchase for only one computer that is sold at a nominal price (around $35). So, even if you had 5 computers, it's better than an annual licence agreement with Microsoft.  And the support at DigitalKeysBox is exceptional!  Recently my hard drive crashed, and although my data was recovered, I was given Windows-11 instead of Windows-10 (my old O/S). Basically, my old version of MS-OFFICE  from DigitalKeysBox wouldn't download correctly.  I sent an email to the support team at DigitalKeysBox and within 24 hrs, I had the new product key at no charge.  These guys want to help, and I support them."

I had a bit of trouble applying the upgrade and used the online help.  The response was very quick, and my support agent Milana was very nice and extremely helpful.  She was even there to greet me after a reboot to guide me the rest of the way.  A great value and great service to boot.  Very uncommon these days.  Thank you Milana and Trustpilot for making the purchase and install of my software very seamless and efficient!"

She then spent about an hour or maybe a little bit longer clearing room on my computer for the Office suite of apps, and then installing them for me.  All the while she was very professional and reassuring.  What took Milana an hour or two would've literally taken me days to figure out.  I can't properly express just how thankful I am for her assistance today, and I would definitely recommend DigitalKeysBox to whoever needs software. Thank you again for everything Milana.  You rock!"

I uninstalled those).3) Followed the link for setup.office.com4) Followed instructions5) Launched Excel and was ready to activate software. I half expected to have to launch EACH app (Word, Power Point, etc.) and activate each one individually. Nope. The app asked me to validate software over phone or using internet. I choose \"Internet.\" It was practically instantaneous, thanks to Microsoft on that for having a fast network infrastructure.6) Came here to say THANK YOU to DigitalKeysBox for providing an easy, fast, safe, and secure purchase/ install and to let all you skeptics know, this IS 100% legit. I saved $120 at least that I would have otherwise spent using the Microsoft Store/ App purchase.Love and respect for all you do, DKB.com. Thank you!"

I was surprised when PayPal informed me that my payment was made to an entity that appears Russian. However, the installation and activation process described on the DKB product webpage before my purchase using a legitimate Microsoft website and the product key provided by DKB after my purchase was accurate, quick and easy, and the Office Professional Plus 2019 I installed and activated on my PC is the authentic Microsoft software."
