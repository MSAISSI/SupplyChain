          "Contenu": "After mailing my mobile phone through UPS, I was advised that I could check my account on Sell That Cell to track my package. This is incorrect, only the UPS tracker kept me updated. I called after a few days to follow up since I hadn\u2019t heard anything. I\u2019m in CA and my package was mailed to TX. I was advised by a Carter that he would call me back in a couple of hours once he had my phone in hand. He ended up texting late at night which is very unprofessional, advising me that he couldn\u2019t unlock my phone. He sent me text after text, asking where I purchased the phone from and how I wanted him to go about unlocking it. He sent screenshots as well. I truly did not know what was happening with my phone or how to fix it. Carter became very aggressive and informed me that he had to send my phone back to me. I called in again to speak with a supervisor about his behavior and come to find out, he is the owner of the company! I WILL NOT be using this company again. Horrible experience that could have been avoided."

My phone was in \"like new\" condition cosmetically, it just was just broken in that it wouldn't turn on anymore. All other websites offered me next to nothing because it automatically classified it as the lowest condition same as a completely smashed phone. The process of selling the phone was very easy. Shipping (and returns if necessary) were paid for and I received the offer, plus a bonus for sending it in quickly, within a couple days of my package arriving. Overall, great experience and I would definitely use this company again for selling any future used phones should the need arise."

I had never heard of them but everything looked so authentic on the site, I thought why not. They even offered an incentive for getting the phones to them quickly of $5 per cell.  So I did everything they instructed, set my phones to factory settings, removed the Sim cards, shined them up, and packaged them safely, and printed out the First Class Packing Return slip and the cell packing slip. The return slip on the outside of my package, and the packing slip inside. I handed it to a postal worker, as Sell That Cell suggested, got a receipt so I could track my package, and waited. I shipped my package on Wednesday, got updates from USPS, Sell That Cell received my package Friday and I had my money Saturday. SEAMLESS! They did everything they said they would do! I highly recommend Sell That Cell the next time you\u2019re looking to upgrade and relinquish old phones."
