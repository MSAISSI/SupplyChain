My experience, so far, is horrible!!!! I have 2 websites with them and BOTH are websites are not working NOT PUBLISHED, I've been lied to about what has been done to rectify my problem, when it hasn't. I started in September with my websites so they'd be up and running for the holiday season and I'm still experiencing trouble and problems! I do not recommend webador to anyone. I'm thinking that's why \"no telephone numbers\" because of the losy service! They don't want hear anything from the public! If you don't want a headache STAY AWAY!!!!!"

My images looked great on the builder and on other sites I was using, but were grainy when I launched the website with Webador. Billing is a scam. I cancel my subscription which I understand they stated a one-month notice. What I didn't know was they were charging me for a full billing cycle and 28 days because I had just paid. In total my cancellation is nearly 2 months. Never dealt with that before. I will just email my bank and they will take care of it for me.Update after Webador's response: I have emails that went both ways talking about the quality of images. No sure they stated they didn't have communication on this subject. They still are charging me for nearly 60 days. Hiding behind fine print doesn't make it right. I didn't want to leave this review, but I also don't like when companies' penny pinch customers. Other web builder companies I've used cancel and refund me the day I cancelled."

I am so annoyed after spending a lot of time putting the site together. It was the last straw today when I sent emails from my personal email to the business email and those didn't come through either. I did this after yet another customer sent me a message on another platform and complained that I wasn't replying to her order or emails. VERY ANNOYED."

They do not include accurate details in their video section was the reason for me leaving but again how they handled it made it clear they are not doing so well financially. So when you view about sexual content, it shows what they do not allow which you will see reading it yourself til they get smart and put no sexual content. It states many things but not that.I was going to keep one of my paid websites but canceled both since they are unprofessional and dishonest.

I wanted to cancel right away and they would NOT refund my annual plan purchase even though it had been less than 24 hours and I was very clear about why I was unhappy with the product.  The 'support' is only by email and they told me to upgrade for a basic thing like putting links in my pages...Basically double the price for HTML links - really? We emailed back and forth a few times and they wouldn't budge.  I now walked away feeling like I was taken and told them I was going to leave a negative review to warn others.

BUT if you running a real business and ever come into any issues with the site or your Webshop its going to be very hard and frustrating getting the problem fixed and getting a hold of someone.its 2023 .. every business should have a costumer service phone number and be able to fix paying costumers issues on the fly...  everyday they take their sweet time to resolve this issue.. is COSTING MY BUSSINESS THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS and they don't care about it very frustrating... i would recommend using a website host that actually got a phone you can call when you have issues... TRUST ME AT SOME POINT YOU WILL NEED SUPPORT AND THEY WILL FAIL YOU.... JUST LIKE THEY DOING TO ME NOW.

Again, they are also still billing me for a site they don't own and do not host, 4trust4equity.com. This lady wants me to pay for unused sites that she has refused to cancel despite requests to do so, the site is still on there and she is still charging me for all of them, even cancelled ones."

That cannot be done, or they make me email people with in their own company to fix my concerns. The worst part is if I leave they own my domain names. I have one I cancelled 6 months ago, and it still has not been released to buy it on another platform. I have to keep old employee emails, or I won\u2019t be able to get my companies emails, if mail gets sent to an old team member. It\u2019s a miracle to me that Webador has so many great reviews. I just feel like I\u2019m stuck, and never should have started with them to begin with. Worst bureau, worst services, worst platform.June 15, 2023 ( response to their reply) I am not able to reply to what Webador replied to me however I can add to my comment. I am a Pastor. I have no reason to lie. I stand by what I said as the truth. I have proof of them asking me to contact other departments with in there company. Who has time to sit here and make up lies, and to post fake reviews. I did this because I know what has happened, I will testify on a stack of bibles, and my answers will not change.I hope our relationship improves with time. I will respond to their email sent to me however it took me posting a review to get some kind of thought felt, I care interaction. Thank you."

          "Contenu": "I purchased a domain through this company because they seemed to offer a good deal. However, upon getting access to my domain I realized I have very limited access to the DNS. The website builder is a joke and does little to offer any sort of actual customization. I was forced to purchase another domain in order to conduct my business and use the Webador domain as a redirect. Because their DNS is laughable and restrictive, I had to find alternate routes in order to do a basic redirect. For this reason, I anticipated when the time my domain became available for transfer (60 days after registration) and I was aware they had a 30-day cancellation period. After submitting my cancellation request, someone from their company comes back via email (yes, only way to contact them), and tells me that I must wait 90 days to transfer my domain, and that it has been sent to some other host and is no longer in their possession. I also received an automated email confirming that apparently, despite the domain being registered to me and inaccessible to me, it is fully accessible to anyone else who would like to obtain it. Then, a completely different representative from the company sends me a follow-up email and explains that her colleague was incorrect about some of the things conveyed, and correct about others. What initially was supposed to be a simple purchase has now turned into a 3-month headache that has the potential to cause damages to me and my business as stated by them my property has the potential to become possessed by a 3rd party entity.Now, if any of this has you confused, you're not alone. Clearly the business called Webador has no idea what they're doing either. They conduct business in a manner that is incongruent with their competitors, provide services that are laughable at best, and then force inconsistent and inexcusable policies on their customers.In short, I highly recommend you conduct business elsewhere, with a reputable and trustworthy company as this one in particular will bring nothing but headaches and difficulties."

I then got an email from the CEO saying he had read the emails (clearly not), said he\u2019s staff we\u2019re polite (I never complained that they were rude- just incapable of problem solving) and he asked me to take my business elsewhere and that if I chose to stay using their services I won\u2019t receive any support from them.

Fast forward one month, money in my bank to take my daughter for breakfast for her birthday and yes they took another \u00a321.60. Emailed again and had to give one months notice so they charged me. she says my subscription will expire on July 16th, i cancelled this back on the 18th May why 2 more months being open. Stay away from this company. Awful customer services, i dont receive any receipts, invoices or notice money is going to be taken out of my account. AWFUL AVOID APPAULING SERVICE/COMPANY.Thanks for the reply, as i said i dont use your site so why would i log in to look for the invoice. You first sent me my first invoice, by email so i assume if i had an bill you would send me the invoice to my email address as before. Like i said before, just a very poor run site."

They asked me to pay for the second year\u2019s invoice and I explained that I would like to take my first website down and build a new one so I was happy to cancel my first one and take out a new subscription. They told me that was not possible and threatened me if I did not pay for my second year. They told me that I could register a new domain and make a new website once I paid for the second year. Fast forward to me wanting to publish the second website, I was then told I\u2019d have to pay for a second subscription and that the domain I had registered on my first subscription could not be transferred. This went on for FOUR months and they refused to help or come up with any useful solution.  After four months they informed me that I could in fact duplicate pages from my second website (I had already built it and didn\u2019t want to have to dismantle my first website and rebuild it), and paste the duplications onto my first website. Why did it take them FOUR months of back and forth and so many emails to tell me this?! They then told me that they would do it for me with my consent, I consented, they confirmed they had done it and nothing. They did nothing. LMAO at this point what was I expecting. Their support had already proven incompetent and unable to think outside of the box. I ended up doing it myself and finally my website was live after FOUR months of being told I\u2019d have to pay for a new subscription. I asked to be compensated by extending my subscription for four months and they were rude, lied to my face saying they had resolved my issue when I resolved it myself and told me they would no longer respond to my emails. Honestly, the amount of time I\u2019ve wasted, frustration I\u2019ve incurred and the impact on my business\u2026 this whole experience has been awful and would have been avoided with knowledgable and helpful support rather than incompetent robots. Would only recommend if you will NEVER require support from them."

Please do not place any order with them unless you are 100% sure that you understand as to what is good or bad for you with this service. Although they advertise that there is a 30 day money back guarantee but that is not the case. This as you will see is clearly put on Trustpilot quoting by them that they offer 3 months full refund guarantee. Well having purchased their hosting service and having had a look in 2 days I requested refund which they have refused giving all sorts of feeble excuses. Now I have lost full 1 year subscription which they have pocketed under false mis-description.  Furthermore their service/website is difficult to operate if you are not very technical minded. There is no telephone support - each time you need help you have to log a ticket/send a message and wait for them to come back. I have copy documents proving my case and in spite of me showing reasonableness and communicating with them in the nicest possible way the refund is refused. SO PLEASE BE CAREFUL AND IF YOU WISH TO DO BUSINESS WITH THEM THEN TAKE EVERYTHING IN WRITING.I WISH I HAD FOLLOWED MY OWN ADVICE."

Now I\u2019ve deleted my account and they just charged me this next month for nothing, haven\u2019t been using any of their services for past 2 months. So I just recommend not using their services, the first 3 month discount is pretty much a trap, so people would get charged the next 2 months for just not being able to cancel subscription. For example you forgot about your subscription, and they charged you the full price, and now that you know you forgot to cancel it, when you cancel you still need to pay for the next month. AMAZING!Imagine you have a bad memory or God forbid alzheimers ,they would just invoice you anyways, because you agreed to terms and conditions."

So I tried desperately to speak to someone who could apply the discounts to upgrade my account but after trying for 2 weeks to contact them via their contact form, email to their support at jouwweb.nl as well as calling them on the telephone to speak to a live person whom we spoke to 3 people over the 2 week period, all who said they couldn't do anything for us over the phone and that someone higher up would contact us shortly to solve the issue still no one has gotten in touch and we haven't even got a reply via email or otherwise to let us know what to do next. Next thing I tried to contact them again today on their telephone number to find out any updates or explanation but the number given doesn't even ring anymore. I am so frustrated over this as I had wanted this upgrade quickly. The worst non-existant Customer Service ever!"

          "Contenu": "This was one of the easiest sites I have ever put together. I have worked with computers since the early 90s and I found the editor and the offerings top-notch. I created a beautiful and useful site in about a half a day. Everything is streamlined, available and insightfully placed for ease of access. My site looks wonderful and modern. I highly recommend that people give this a try whether you are a highly technical user or a  non-technical user. You will be surprised and pleased. I have had to downsize this for the following reason. The biggest downside of this site is that you will still not be found unless you use a paid version, even if you set your setting correctly on the seo portion, I tried searching for my page and was not able to find it  the only way I could get to it was using the direct address. That makes it fairly pointless to create a website that can't be found. I will upgrade this if this changes in the future. UPDATE 5/20/22 Received an emai, which was nice it was written to me and I appreciate that they took the time to do this, like I said was nice, they explained that it is out of their hands and some stuff that google does not like sites with advertising and so on. The entire internet is one big advertising platform and almost every site I visit I am barraged with advertising so I know that can't be true, however I do know that they have the free sites locked down - meaning they are not submitted and may have a robot file directing google and other search engines away from them. Like I said I have been on the internet since the early 90's and I have kept up with some things. I also know that it can take time for Google to find a site so I will wait a few more weeks then look for another platform. this is pretty much usless to me if I cannot be found by a search engine without putting out a bucket of money. My site is for a public purpose to assist with voting and I will not reap any benefits from it monetarily. It deos however benefit me when I am researching candidates."

          "Contenu": "Webador was a good company.  Service had always been very good.  That was until I tried to leave.  I requested that they release my domain name so that I could use it with a different provider.  I sent them the initial email on 3rd September 2020.  On 4th September 2020, I had to email them again to request that they cancel my subscription.  I received an email back saying that my Pro plan was cancelled and would expire on 27th October 2020.  I was a little bit unsure as to why so I went back to re-read the terms and conditions.  I found that they required a one-month cancellation notice but my payment was due to in the middle of that month.  So I emailed them again and offered to pay the next payment and requested that I had my domain released.  I said I didn't mind paying on 28th September 2020 even though I wasn't planning to use the site as it was me that wanted to end the contract and I didn't want to wait until the expiry date.  I had no issue paying the September payment.  All I wanted was my domain name released. The company I want to switch to suggested that I request that Webador \"pointed\" my domain to their servers and gave me the information which I passed on to Webador but they still won't do that. I was considering leaving them a good review in my blog when my new website was uploaded, until I had this problem.Update: Webador have now dropped my domain name today (27th September 2020) even though they specifically told me they couldn't until 27th October 2020.  I now cannot access my emails, even though I was expecting some to come in.  I can't connect my domain name to my new website provider still as it's still showing as unavailable.  Yes I wanted them to drop my domain name but I was willing to wait until 27th October since they said it couldn't be dropped earlier.  I didn't want it dropped unexpectedly like that.  I wouldn't have sent out those emails yesterday if I'd have known they were just gonna drop my domain just like that, with no warning!"

DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!I really really wish I checked out the one star reviews before I signed up for my issue is identical to theirs. In June I attempted to cancel my domain, I followed their help section and clicked cancel and the page took me back to the home page - NO ERROR MESSAGE, NO PLEASE CONTACT CUSTOMER SERVICE so I believed all was well. Then I was billed in July. I thought okay my fault, maybe I didn't click all the buttons I was supposed to or missed a step. Let me try again, so in July I cancelled again. Followed every step they said, even though it took me round the bend a few times, I clicked cancel and i thought it was done with. Now they are trying to bill me again for August and WORSE they now say i owe them for September as well???? In all the years I dealt with Wix in America I never had this kind of scam like customer service! I then emailed to ask for the Aug invoice to be cancelled explaining the whole situation and low and behold I got a series of extremely rude and discourteous emails from one person, who I'm starting to think is the only person who works there suspiciously and so i responded aggravated in kind.   I then asked for this to be escalated to a manager of which i was told they would just say the same as her. I then asked for a phone call to calmly discuss the matter, suddenly they dont have one phone for such occasions? Her snobby email kept advising on policy... newsflash... you have nothing in your policy when it comes to clients who try to cancel who get no error message indicating their cancellation didnt work! There wasnt even a pop up to say please contact customer service but i was supposed to be psychic and just know the cancellation didnt go through and contact them. This has been the worst experience ever and I took time out of work to deal with it. I will be going to social media and trading standards about this as they are trying still to take money out of my account and its now classified as stealing. AGAIN BEWARE! DONT USE UNLESS YOUR PLANNING TO STAY WITH THEM FOR LIFE as you will never stop paying them.    BTW, They only have 500 followers on Insta and they don't answer any of their twitter comments and im fairly sure the 5 star reviews on this platform are not 100% genuine or are people who haven't tried to leave them yet. This isnt defamation its the truth and a real life story.****In reply to the review reply -1. No one threatened anyone2. I did not opt out to try and cancel my subscription that\u2019s absurd3. As explained, trust pilot reviewed my review and posted it saying it was fine so another lie exposed4. Your still charging me for august so why are you saying you have cancelled all the charges, another lie.Everything I have said in my review is fact and if in doubt check out the other 1 star reviews. You can\u2019t call us all liars.Seriously all, do not use this company!"

Surprisingly if you pay for the 'pro' version you can't publish your site without registering your own domain name (no option to choose a free webador domain) so if you have to wait 60 days or so for the domain to transfer over you can't publish the site."

I contacted Webador to say my email has stopped working, and gave them the information they asked for. I then got another email asking me if I had put my credentials in properly which I thought was a bit insulting, giving the fact the emails were working perfectly fine before. The email also had a so called help sheet which was in dutch. I was then told to google translate the information. This was not helpful at all, I emailed back advising I need my emails working asap, as I have a very important opportunity and I was communicating via email with the organizer. This was this morning, as I write this review at 21:23 i've stilled heard nothing, so if it wasn't for my persistence I would have still not had my emails working. I actually worked the problem out myself, with a little help from a friend. I'm fuming regarding the service I have received. I will be definitely be looking to move my hosting/website elsewhere, as soon as I can find a company who actually care about their customers!!!!"

Reading the reviews here, I can't deny that a part of me wished to still be using Webador for my site, but being in Italy perhaps, the site gets a little wonky here and there, making it uncomfortable for me to keep switching the site back to English. It's almost as if the English site is separated from the Italian site and they don't sync with whatever edits I made. It was a frustrating experience with so much refreshing and redoing.Again, maybe it was just that one day when I was working on it. But I stopped instantly after that and decided to stop using it altogether after discovering another platform. Therefore, I can't tell whether Webador is actually a good choice overall.Nevertheless, thank you for the opportunity and I'll definitely try again in the future in case there's some new improvements."

These people really don't know how to do much on a computer and they are just hoping it's going to be click this button, choose this style and get this website.  Which in some ways when you think about it, it should be like that, but it isn't, why not?  It's actually designing a signup process to give the user exactly what you say he gets in the free package and use as little steps as possible for him to get there.  It should be the easiest thing in the world to come up with so why isn't it?  You need to make money from it and you're under the illusion that if you hide marketing and signups within the process and make it more complicated for the user then you will get more signups.  What if you got more signups because the process was the best signup process in itself!  Basically you complicated a \"sign up process\" by doing something within to get more sign ups and ruining the sign up process.  Not necessarily in my opinion because I used to run my own IT business so I know how things are done and how to get around them but the average user wanting a new website which could potentially be a guy accessing a computer for the first time isn't going to get to the stage I did very quickly at all."

A solid 3 though until issue is fixed.Really easy to make the website and store as required. however and this is a major problem  the stripe payments did not code properly due to a slight break in connection and there seems to be no way to reset the connection. I have done what webador advised and revoked authorisation which means webador is no longer connected to my stripe. No way of reconnecting as it still says accepting payments via stripe meaning I've currently lost customers over past few days \u00a3170 worth to be exact due to payment error and no way for me or them to fix it"

However, the builder lacks a modern and refreshed set of templates, lack of in-depth customization and worst of all, the online payment method for your store does not have PayPal partnered up with it. Other than that, its a great builder and although sometimes you\u2019ll come across some \u201cGerman\u201d words (I think its German lol) the website builder doesn\u2019t shy out on helping you to solves all your questions. Lastly, its statistics page is amazing...only if you live in certain countries - so if you\u2019re like me, living on a small island called Malta, then you are quite limited to statistics based on you location.Yes - You would use this builder due to its simplicity to use, pricing and \u201cwhat you get\u201d for your money\u2019s worth. Oh, and also because its a good way to start learning how to build a website.No - It lacks loads of things (read above) than I would need to use regularly and this end up trying to find a way to do what I intended to..hence waste time."

I did not say I wanted to upload my own videos. I only want to insert video links from another video host platform other than youtube. I can't use their product if I can't even see if a simple html video link would work. Because of this Webador restriction, I found I can create and publish a static html website and link non-youtube videos for free on other platforms.While Webador got a respectful, and balanced review and free marketing advice from me.Original Review:I like the website builder. Its very user friendly and not complicated.I have a small website that is just for a few viewers so I find the free plan is all I would need, but I found out stumbling block after much time as I made a few pages.I have my videos stored on a video streaming host that is not youtube or vimeo. The price to level up in order to place a url of a video not on youtube or vimeo is too high. FYI: Paying is also required to use Embed html vids.If they changed the Free plan to ALLOW videos hosted on other platforms -  then I'd say this is a great place. They can do this by allowing special categories in the free plan to have this feature. For example: For very small websites like a memorial site or Special categories/something like that - which could be a good marketing tool and bring more popularity to this site.(Which would help them as usually cdn hosted video and images are a lot faster, smaller and secure that would help their server end, especially since they wouldn't be uploaded) So to offer this in the Free category woud help them/not hurt them, as to pay only to use non-youtube or non-vimeo links can be a deal breaker and stop growth in future customer base/relationship.If you only have images or just words then this would be a good way to go. You will have their subdomain website name.I hope they will allow video urls from other hosts cdn's or embed vid players in the free plan feature, Soon. Then people can see if its worth it to pay in the future if their website grows."

It would have been 5 stars but I have deducted a star for the amount of time it takes to get a response to a request for help.Webador is my 2nd attempt at building an online shop. The 1st was one of the biggest providers in the UK and was way more complicated than Webador. I'm so glad I made the swap. I'm a complete novice and technophobe but Webador made it easy.The only thing that changed my experience from 5 stars to 4 stars is the manner in which you have to request help. I knew at the outset that there would be no telephone support. That wasn't an issue. I had assumed, wrongly it seems, that there would be a webchat facility. But in fact, the support is essentially by email. This is very frustrating when you have what should essentially be a short question to answer, but you have to send an email andcwait for a response. You can wait anywhere up to 24 hours to hear back from them. During that time my webshop is probably loosing money because customer have no idea how the cursor functions and there's not an obvious setting to change it from hover to click. The help guides can be difficult to use as well.I wouldn't want to go to another company. But I would rather be placed in a queue on a live chat than be frustrated waiting for an email that may take 24 hours be sent."

          "Contenu": "I was browsing around for a website builder, and I have tried a couple such as Weebly and Wix.Then I stumbled across Webador as I was searching around, and I noticed that the features may seem too good to be true at first, and it is somewhat.A gripe that I have with Webador is that it doesn't really tell you what features are exclusively for Pro or Business when you edit your website until you try to use them.  Yes, I am aware that they provide a list of what tiers have, but I think it would be beneficial if it some of the features, such as the photo album, would have like a label that only Pro/Business account can have.  Lite allows you to have a custom domain, but that's it.It would be nice if said features would allow you to toy them, but it wouldn't be able to publish the site until it was deleted, but Webador auto-saves your work, which is really nice!  This would really benefit people to give these premium features a try before buying, even if Webador gives a generous discount in the first year of subscription.It's pretty straightforward and doesn't involve coding (unless you want to try your hand with custom HTML feature, which also requires pro/business account).Webador doesn't allow too much customization for different pages for free, in which their selling point is getting to the point and ease of use for other people, which it clearly shows!That being said, the Free plan offers quite a bit for those what want to give Webador a try.Other than that, Webador does have potential and their support has been fantastic!  They were able to answer my questions that I had for them!  However, support isn't immediate (seems like a 24 hour turn around) so I would keep that in mind.  Webador is also one of the more affordable website builders you can get.  I'm looking forward to see how Webador grows in a span of years."

I was looking for Weebly but chose Webador by mistake (mostly because they changed their name to Square) 4.  It takes 24 hours to get a response to questions through emails.

The platform offers a variety of features and tools to create a website that suits one's needs. The templates are visually appealing, and the drag-and-drop interface is user-friendly, making it easy for anyone to use.However, there are a few areas where I believe Webador can improve to enhance its service and make it even more user-friendly. Here are some suggestions:Improve the speed and performance of the platform: While the platform is easy to use, it can be slow at times, which can be frustrating for users. Improving the speed and performance of the platform would greatly enhance the user experience.Offer more customization options: While the templates are visually appealing, they can feel somewhat limiting when it comes to customization. Offering more options for users to customize their websites would allow them to create a more unique and personalized site.Provide more detailed tutorials and support: While the platform is relatively user-friendly, it can be difficult for beginners to get started. Providing more detailed tutorials and support would help users get up and running more quickly.Overall, I believe that Webador is a great website builder platform, and with a few improvements, it has the potential to be even better. By improving the speed and performance of the platform, offering more customization options, and providing more detailed tutorials and support, Webador can enhance its service and become even more user-friendly."

Honestly I recommend Webador all day long, if you need a web building site stop looking and visit Webador, you wont be disappointed, very reasonably priced as well compared to others. Heres my site made in a few hours, there is also ample opportunity for editing which I will continue with to perfect. scottishvoiceover.org.uk"
