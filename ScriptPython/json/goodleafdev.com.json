It will keep saying Active but it wont be online. Support doesnt help you, if they even decide to reply at all to begin with you will be waiting even longer for a reply than it takes for the vps to start magically working on its own again."

          "Titre": "Not Great, Not Terrible",
          "Contenu": "I had my VPS deployed by the Owner/Sysadmin/Support Agent/Billing Agent/Technical Support Agent/CFO/CEO NateB.I received the email for my services (Found it in the spam folder) and right off the bat, some login credentials for my service were missing. No biggie, Nate was quick to give me answers and find that information for me. The machine in theory had ok specs, but the internet was not great and fluctuated at times. At the time of my test (Using speedtest CLI) I got 42ms ping, 57mbs down, 940 up. I did however have a few issues. On 7/29/2022 there was announced downtime in which my service was offline for 16+hrs. I also referred my friend to this service, and my friend's server was on a node in which a double drive failure occurred and his data has been inaccessible for weeks now (The owner says they are working to restore the drive, my friend was not transferred to a new node and his service is still down, he was compensated 2 free months) As far as professionalism goes, there are a few things that could be improved on. For example, at one point last week, there was a case in which the owner was having a disagreement with a ex-customer and decided to post about it in the #annoucement chat of discord. The owner name-dropped the ex-customer and released information regarding a fine the ex-customer incurred. I've also experienced the owner of this host's interaction with competitors. While I fully support being competitive in the market, this type of competition was done in a non constructive way. Mocking another hosting company, laughing at ideas and those that proposed them, name calling, borderline bullying, discouraging words like \"you'll never succeed\".  Overall, this host has potential and I'm not sure I would recommend it to my friends at this point in time, based on reliability, affordability, maturity, and overall feel for the company.There site has now been down for 24 hrs with no announcement or response from the owner. (Possible Exit scam?)Update: The site outage only lasted for 5 days.Update2: 8/6/2022Coincidently, 11 hours ago my free VPS was terminated by the owner without reason after the owner of the company replied to my review.. I guess you have to be careful about who you review.Update3: 8/6/2022I've been contacted by trustpilot to provide details as the owner is attempting to take down my review."
