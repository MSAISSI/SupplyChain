I paid $9.95 for postal service only to have the check come more than a week later (when it's suppose to be 2-day delivery) - then USPS didn't even drop off to me but instead I had to chase down the postal truck so I can get the mail!  This is not within the control of cashforyourmac but for the extra paid delivery service, I'd really expect cashforyourmac to seek another courier.  I've never used this company before.  But after having securely packaged my laptop and sent down to SanDiego, I waited.  I sent out the laptop 5pm on Nov 27 and I received my check in hand (after chasing down the mail man) on Dec 14.  This was during the holiday so most likely couriers were very busy.Overall I will HIGHLY recommend cashforyourmac because they are honest and very professional.  I did not have to contact them at all and everything was done according to their guide.  I am very pleased and the price was reasonable.  Much more so than local sale.  If you are seeking to sell your apple products, this would be the place to go!  The only issue I had was spending the extra $9.95 (2-day delivery method) only to have USPS muck everything up.  If not for this hiccup, I would rate this company 5 stars for everything."

Will use again if needed.Suggestion: They should update instructions for packing to include the option for FedEx\u2019s laptop box. It cost me extra $ but it was its a well designed box for sending laptops and accessories without worry of damage and I believe it supersedes the packaging requirements they (CashForYourMac) state. Better yet if they worked out a deal with FedEx to include that box when someone sells to turn it could be part of the whole deal and cost less $ for the box from higher volume usage."

Even comparing other online vendors I had used previously, they couldn't come close to matching the offer.So, I was a bit apprehensive about trusting CFYM.

Within a few short days, a check was in the mail for the promised amount.Just blown away by how smoothly the process went and you can be assured they will be the first place I look to selling my next piece of Apple equipment."
