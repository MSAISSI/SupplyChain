          "Contenu": "Our experience has been everything frustrating. Waiting on hold for customer service for a couple of hours try to do a call back it goes immediately to voicemail if you email him it takes days to get an answer. Setting up our second phone took literally two weeks to get done and accomplished. I chose to go with this company because of things they support but they do not have enough customer service to take care of the people. As far as their phone service goes I'm not saving any money by going to this. Data and hotspot I'll use exactly the same amount it's not two separate amounts and they have no plans of fixing that. I would like to change my plan to a less expensive plan but have not figured a way to do that on the website and I'm tired of trying to get a hold of customer service. We have a new phone to hook up under one of the phone numbers I keep being told that I can put in a SIM card that was sent but it doesn't work it does not have the phone number connected to it like I'm told and I give up on trying to contact customer service anymore. So as soon as I figure out what other phone company to try just kind of stuck here. Very sad"

But y\u2019all turn on a Account that has a new number to it. So that\u2019s why I say that I DID NOT Authorize it! Now y\u2019all are saying when I do authorize you to turn it on I will have to pay for a new Sims card $10.99 + taxes + shipping. That will never happen! Your company is as bad as AT&T !! It\u2019s not about the money it\u2019s about the principal !!!! I am so glad that I seen how you run your business before I got in to deep! I hope I am the only one that this has happened to, but sadly I know that is impossible! Good luck screwing your customers, because it will come back to bite you in the ass! You should charge your name to your company it gives Patriots a bad name!"

Think of it this way. The big carriers can offer you 90 percent of the bandwidth pie.  The other 10 percent sliver is divided up between all the low price carriers.  Its no wonder why after a few days or a week your service is throttled because you have used up all the bandwidth they have to offer.  Did anyone notice that all of the replies to the negative service reviews read exactly the same.  Its because there is nothing Patriot Mobile can do to solve the problem.  They only have a tiny part of the bandwidth pie to offer you and when it is gone, it is gone.  If all you need to do is send a few texts now and then or make a few phone calls to loved ones every month, it will probably work for you.  But if you do any heavy surfing of the web, your data will be used up very quickly because they only have a tiny portion to offer you."

Once back in the country. I called again on my no service phone and I was given their Hot Line status connection I waited probably over an hour and I hung up. On the 4th. I was resolved to deal with this PROBLEM I called their number again and was on for 1 1/2 hrs and finally just hung up. On December 6, I emailed them to close my account: 13 emails later, I still had not resolved anything and as best I can tell did not get my account closed. The last email, I asked what was owed on the account. They quit responding.  I thought they went home for the day. But they never have responded! All they said was my card was declined and yet I use this card everyday. What's amazing is it has NEVER crossed anyone's mind to call me on the disconnected phone?Go elsewhere! I have now called several days this week and before. I have now a total of 4+ hours waiting on hold for a Customer Service Representative to straighten out my account. Today, I was on hold for 1 1/2 hours and no rep! They continue to take money on my card and send notes about how my account is past due. No service, but plenty of Customer No Service. The number of spam calls and collection calls I get is now in the thousands. Not sure why they would give me a number that so recently used. I am a Christian man, giving a Chritian company a try. After 4 months I decided to keep Verizon. Don't waste your time or money."

After watching a few movies, couldn\u2019t load anything on my phone or look into anything as there was no longer internet available. Patriot mobile claims the data was used up already when I was advised it was unlimited in the sales call to switch.

I could not receive calls or dial out. I could not use my text messaging. The internet worked but so even when I put in a ticket online, they could not call me back to respond. It made me feel unsafe. They have limited phone options. I would love to see a viable satellite phone option. I'm torn because I feel like I have to compromise what I pay for to be with a company who shares my beliefs. Why should there ever be a trade-off? This is America, we should be able to produce an excellent product supported by 1st class tech support at a competitive price without compromising technology and features."

I also paid extra to have service in Canada, even though we were only there a couple of days. Only when I called (from my wife's Verizon phone) customer service from AK did they tell me they don't provide service there. The next big strike was when I started having trouble with my voice mail. When I called for help, I was told they don't support Visual Voice Mail for Android phones, even though they initially walked me through setting it up, and it had been working for months. Now they're saying they never supported it. I just placed an order to change providers to Pure Talk, who say they provide Visual Voice Mail and VM to text at no additional cost. Instead of using the T-Mobile network, they use AT&T's, and they're about $20 a month less than Patriot Mobile. If that one is no better than Patriot, I'll be going back to Verizon."

I am constantly trying to get a Reset to my phone, and I'm paying each month for service, but only have it half of the time. Calling Customer Service is a nightmare, as they're always too busy to answer my call. I cannot recommend Patriot Mobile to anyone with these conditions. I don't hate anyone that bad.

For Xmas, I received a new iPhone that was already with another carrier.  When I called Patriot to cancel and gave my reason, I was asked if I no longer needed the number.  After saying I didn't,  the line was disconnected mid-conversation.  No goodbye or telling me the line was about to be disconnected.  So, 2 cust svc reps have been kind of rude.

I will be connected to Verizon or AT&T by tomorrow, I can guarantee you that! I came to patriot mobile with a paid off phone and an unlocked phone I bought from Samsung online. Like I said, it went from great, to horrible and all in between, in a matter of months. I'm done! There's a reason Verizon and AT&T are so big... they actually work!"

Easy to sign up and get a SIM card mailed. 5 star up to this point. NOW the issues start. The AT&T and other big companies give you a transfer # needed to switch over. It's good for 3 days. It takes 3 days to get the SIM card from Patriot. If it's a weekend transfer then note that they are closed on Sunday. Now you try to transfer the service and if you need ANY help then you are on your own. No one answers the phone. I emailed for 3 hours and only got confirmation that my request was received. I don't have 3+ hours for this. They need more help or a designated person for your acct that you only deal with them. They also could create an activation hotline. This is a major turnoff. Being ignored is frustrating. Now its 3 1/2 hrs trying."

As of today (Sunday), I have lost approximately $1200 in total revenue that normally funds my small farm operation for the first part of summer. I used the contact form on the website, thinking that at the very least it was monitored occasionally to address outages; sadly this was not the case.Back to Verizon, SIM on the way and transfer information provided.

          "Contenu": "Had AT&T since April 2022, but their reception was terrible, along w/their customer service. So, last week (May 17th) I switched to Patriot Mobile for their cheaper price. Paid $75 for the service + activation + taxes, and filled out necessary online paperwork to port my number over from AT&T. ATT sent me a text asking 'if it was me making the porting request,' and I replied 'yes.' Discovered early Friday, the porting did not go through, so called Patriot Mobile, and they set up a conference call w/them, me, & AT&T customer service. The only way AT&T would port my number was if Patriot Mobile canceled my order and resubmitted the porting request. After that mess was dealt with, I was eventually able to insert my new SIM card, but it only worked for about half a day. At 12:30 a.m. Saturday, my phone told me \"No SIM Card Found,\" and it's been that way ever since, despite notifying Patriot Mobile through email of the problem on Saturday, and asking them to send a new SIM card. Patriot Mobile \"customer service\" did NOTHING, until I told them, Monday afternoon (May 23rd) that I was shopping for another service provider. They told me they wanted me to buy a second cell phone, buy service for it, then CALL THEM to 'fix the issue,' with my original phone. They don't have people reading their customer service emails. They use bots for that. I just purchased service with yet another cellular service provider, and am hoping that, within another week, this nightmare will finally be over. These people only care about the $$$ you give them, not whether you have service or not.Direct to Patriot Mobile: I am NOT new to cellular phones, and my cell phone works great; it was only YOUR SERVICE that sucked (since you shut off my SIM card). There is NOTHING you can do to 'make up' for your refusal to act when I asked you to send a new SIM card; that's on you. I am happy with my new service provider, Consumer Cellular."

So they sent me AT&T Sim cards. But when we put them in my phone would not work at all! And when we tried to put the T-Mobile Sim card back in my phone still would not come on although my husband\u2019s did. I will say every time we called I spoke to an actual person who understood me and I could understand them. And they all tried to help! Customer service is not a problem. But for some reason they could just not get my phone to work. The T-Mobile Sim card turned the phone on but I was unable to send texts or pictures to several members of my family. We tried the process three times! But my husband uses his phone for work and I am disabled and need to have a usable phone. So after 2 1/2 months we went back to AT&T which cost me a lot of money! Very disappointing! I will say it took more than four days to get all three phones on my plan to work. Patriot Mobile cannot seem to break the contact with our phone."

          "Contenu": "UPDATE: I was finally able to reach a person at Patriot Mobile who actually offered to help me. Since I was still in a holding pattern with my previous provider and Patriot Mobile and had no phone service at all on that phone, I decided to go ahead and activate with Patriot Mobile after I was offered a free month of service. It really isn't a free month, since I had already paid the other provider for the month, and I lost that month since the number was ported. In any event, I have upgraded my review to 2 stars. Hopefully, as time goes on, this will be a good provider, but only time will tell. As a conservative, I wanted to support Patriot Mobile. I signed up and paid the fee. I had a trip scheduled to watch my grandson in his final college soccer game, and I began to receive emails telling me to activate with my new SIM card. Since I was out of state, I couldn't do that. I emailed the customer support email, apprising them of the fact that I was unable to activate until I returned home. I never received a response. Then, several days later, I received an email telling me they were going to start charging me, so I'd better activate now. I could see the writing on the wall that customer service (and customers) is not a priority with this company. I emailed and told them to cancel the order. More than a week later, they ported my number, and I was left with no service because I hadn't been able to retrieve the SIM card. I called the supposed customer support number. I reached technical support who told me that customer service didn't have a good phone number, but that there was nothing she (Jennifer) could do. Their system was going to charge me and port my number, regardless of my concerns or wishes. That's just how they do things. I contacted my previous provider, apprising them of the situation (that my number was ported despite my instructions to cancel the order). Hopefully, at some point, I will have service again. I have paid each of two companies for a month of phone service, and I have no phone service. I hope my previous company can straighten it out because Patriot Mobile is obviously not going to assist. I've specifically told them to cancel (for the third time) and not to charge my credit card again. We'll see what happens. I have a feeling it's going to be a long battle. Please be very cautious with this company and know that customer service is essentially non-existent."

I could wait two days, but I told him the phone was needed for two step authentication and I needed it asap.  On Saturday I had not yet received anything from Fed-Ex.  I contacted Patriot and found out they had not yet sent out the card.   They waited until Saturday to begin the process.  Almost 2 days later.  Nevertheless, I finally received a tracking number from Patriot and was advised the card would arrive on Tuesday the 8th before the end of the day.  In the meantime, I received what I would call a \"nasty gram\" from Patriot that said in a nutshell \" \"Our records show that your new Patriot Mobile phone is not yet activated\"  Per our Terms and Conditions, billing will start in 7 days...\"Computer generated or not, that wasn't cool to receive.  As if I was in violation and it was all my fault.  I immediately sent a response and never heard back.  Tuesday evening came and went and no card.  It was later that evening I received another email that advised me there was a delay.  Ya Think!  They didnt know this before 4:30 at the end of the day?  Patriot never contacted me and said a word about weather. I received a second email advising the card will arrive on Thursday at the end of day.  We shall see.I contacted Patriot Mobile. She said they could not help what the weather had done.  I agree.  BUT, if they knew the weather was a factor WHY didn't they mention this during step 1?   I could have found another option for a month and come back.I think the company has started out with crummy customer service.  They should offer a free month for the headache involved. But when I mentioned cancelling all of this b/c of the headache, she was ready to that immediately.  After all, I am just a number and could be replaced, right?  I gave two stars because of what the company does. Otherwise it should be a one star.Update 02092022- My sim card arrived unexpectedly. I was told it would not arrive until 2-10-22.  I was unable to activate my phone even after following the instructions sent through email.  I called Patriot Mobile.  The refused to help me unless I gave them the last four of my credit card.  I have spoken to them two other times since this headache began and verified who I was with no credit card.  Now they refused to speak to me.  I told her I dont need to talk to anyone. I just want to activate my phone.  Does it get worse?"

At first I was told that a customer care rep would email me, but the person messaging me via FB ended up relaying between me and tech support for yet another several hours. In the end I had to do a factory reset on my phone in order to get the SIM activation to work. The FB message person did check with me a day or two later to see if things were still ok. The FB interaction is the only reason I gave two stars instead of one. So far my experience on the Sprint network is noticeably worse than on Verizon (was with them for years) with pauses and delays receiving data, despite living in the middle of an actual city.Honestly, if I could go back in time with the knowledge I have now, I would swallow the extra cost and stay with Verizon. Sad. Guess I will see how things go with Patriot for now, but it's like heading into a combat zone with that one dude you don't really trust. I really hated that."

At first they sent out the wrong SIM cards but began the porting process on my phone before that was figured out. So they had to send out new SIM cards which took 3 days meantime I did not have a phone because they had already began the porting process from my previous carrier. Fast forward 3 days to when the new SIM cards finally arrive I was able to get my phone set up after being on the phone with them  for at least an hour. Then we start the process on my wife's phone. The lady says that the port had started and wanted to hang up with me and said that she would call back when the port had completed. That was around noon and I never received a call back and now my wife's phone doesn't work either. I've called them twice today and the first person I talked to was nice and said to confirm the account info with the previous carrier and to call back when I had confirmed it so they could try porting the phone again. I got the correct info which was the same as the info I had given them before and called again. This was at about 8:20 PM and customer service ends at 8:30 PM so I was trying  to get my wife's phone working before she had to spend another night without it. I was able to get in touch with someone who I assume was about to get off work and they made sure I knew that they were not interested in getting my wife's phone working and were very annoyed I called them. I was interrupted multiple times and after I had given him the same account info as I had already given them before he said it was updated and would port the number again. I asked what the info they had was before because everything I had just told him was the same as I had already given. The representative was very irritated at my question and said he couldn't tell me.  I had had enough and knew I wasn't going to receive any more help because it was approaching 8:30 PM and all the person I was on the phone with cared about was getting off the phone with me. This has turned into a nightmare and I regret ever trying to join patriot mobile. It's been over a week that we haven't had both of our phones working and from the service I've received I don't see these issues getting resolved anytime soon."

After a lengthy discussion with ATT customer service, they removed the charge and magically service was back to normal.  I have to question in my case if Patriot is my provider with an ATT sim? Seems as though this may not be the case and gives concern over privacy.  At minimum service should NOT be impacted for 3rd party providers?

Hope it is corrected in the next cycle.  Also have problems with the billing process itself.  They bill a single line charge for each month, with no breakdown of what makes up the monthly charge, so I cannot easily review the bill. Even though the email says to go to the website for details, the website says the bill breakdown is NOT AVAILABLE UNTIL THE FOLLOWING MONTH!  What other service does not allow you to review your monthly bill until a month after you pay that unsubstantiated amount?  None that I know of.  Finally, I was promised by a supervisor \"Harold\" to receive a call back from their billing manager \"Rodney\" about the above billing issues.  But to date I have never received a call back (I have google voice to capture any voicemails so there was no attempt to contact me).  That is disappointing.  I want to support and recommend a conservative company like this, but they have serious growing pains to address."

Logic dictates that since not everyone will use all their data there should be plenty to spare for everyone without any throttling.  This lack of response erodes any trust I have in your organization and will lead customers to find a better service provider.  Just let me know how I can help you do better.  Who is standing in your way?"

So even with an individual getting to the point to where he or she can trust a corporation, like Patriot Mobile---even though you're not an AT&T or a Verizon or a Sprint---you're still a corporation. You're still \"corporate\" and the trust that we individuals (many of us) used to have with our American corporations---has been all but decimated. It's really sad. So, it's gonna take me time, as an individual, to trust you, as a company. This is especially to trust you as a company that values God, family and country. Even in that realm (governmenal leadership) we have been completely disappointed. Inside of just about all of the connections we can have with other human beings is gonna take prayer and---within God's Grace---a lot of work. That's for you corporate entities as well as for us everyday individuals. It's gonna take time to rebuild trust in America."

My son suggested that part of the problem I was having was that I didn't have a data plan. Bingo! Patriot Mobile is addressing this as I write this. On the darker side. My last phone was a Sonim XP3900 Plus. This phone was very difficult to learn to use as I am a big time texter. This is the wrong phone for that if you don't want to jump through a LOT of hoops. Patriot Mobile really did very little to help me with that. I ended up experimenting and figuring it all out the HARD way. Most of what I had to do was NOT in the manual. In fairness, that's really Sonim's fault, not Patriot Mobile's, except that  they are the ones who sold me the phone. I had a Love/Hate relationship with that phone from the moment I opened the box. I hope to have better luck with my new iPhone SE/3. :-]"

Verizon is the gold standard in my opinion for mobile phone service except if you upgrade to a more costly plan in Verizon there is no going back to the lower cost plan because it becomes unavailable almost the moment I upgraded. Patriot keeps the entry level plans available to everyone so as their needs change they can move in and out of whatever plan is most suitable for their current situation. Patriot offers a very nice referral plan ability that creates a win win situation for old and new clients. If they would streamline the referral process a bit more, and continue to invest to improve their website then I believe it's almost guaranteed Patriot would receive more 5.0 star ratings. I love that Patriot Mobile promotes life, personal responsibility, and freedom. Many companies have colluded with the federal and state governments to give them more influence over Americans than what the Constitution permits.  Patriot Mobile doesn't play that game."
