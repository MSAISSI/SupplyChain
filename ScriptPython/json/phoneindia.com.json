I'm keeping this service just for an emergency purpose if I need to ring directly even that takes a while. If your call answered line breaks both parties cannot hear each other also disconnect call automatically in middle of the conversation. This app totally not worth a penny. Highly not recommended for calling India."

I called PhoneIndia and after listening my concern they cancelled my account. They have also cleared all call logs which are present in AT&T bill. This is very unprofessional act from PhoneIndia and they should accept to the mistake from their side and should process the refund ASAP.Order no 7192262"

They are rounting of the call to minute, which is not fair. Also, in the autopay renewal process, existing available balances are getting wiped out and I have lost almost 120+ mins. When I called the customer care, they are very unresponsive and directly told me to cancel the account, not at all ready to think about the customer loss and pain. If they are correcting their mistakes, it will be one of the best calling plan."

I will better use some other service for recharging in India. I tried recharging two number back to back. one that I did first went through but the second one stayed pending forever. I tried recharging it on Friday and today is Tuesday and it is still on pending. one of the customer service representative said it got cancel and you have to re-do it. I tried to recharge the same number again but the automatic system said your previous transaction is still in pending. contact customer service first before completing this transaction.

Support team says \"We don't have any time-frame to resolve the issue\".While I am writing this I have total 748 minutes from my monthly plan which will expire in 2 week time and \u20ac1.77 in main balance. I have discontinued my monthly plan and don't think that I I will ever recommend anyone to Phoneindia. They don't value loyalty.Today I am suffering. Tomorrow,the same thing can happen to you.Please be aware and use your concise before deciding to use service of Phoneindia.com.Good Luck!Yours SincerelySamir Suin"

Such an error in the mix-up of accounts should never happen. Fortunately, the representative was able to fix the problem quickly (that is the only reason for 2 stars instead of 1 star).Postscript:Looking at their reply, I don't think that this company understands the issue. If I am at the PhoneIndia web site, it should not matter whether I use a regular log-in or my email address for log-n, if it lets me log in, accepts my money, sends me a receipts from my PhoneIndia account, never gives any indication that the money is being put into a completely different account (PhoneClub), it is a major web design issue on the company's side!"

I have 7.99 plan but does not allow carry forward of unutilised minutes 2. Quite often the available time is almost half of the balance I carry hence need to disconnect and call again as the minutes consumed is much higher. This seems to be technology issue as after I disconnect couple times, I can hear the right balance available before making a call3. There are changes to billing dates without communication in advance. This led to loss of minutes on multiple occasions 4. On multiple occasions the calls don't go through or I receive a message saying I don't have enough credit / balance5. Frequent call drops. This is the main reason I moved from 07755 to phone India. Now considering going back as 07755 as unlimited minutes for \u00a35 a month"

Since mid-February 2018, however, the calls frequently get cut off wth an automated voice asking to \u201center the number you wish to call\u201d. Another issue is the frequent static noise. Lastly, after connecting to the person on the other end, either the caller or the other person cannot hear each other. I have had to disconnect and call again. This happens one-third of the time. I hope these issues will be resolved soon. Thank you."

So in this situation Customer have to find other company in which we can get more calling minutes.\r3\rWell I am from new Zealand and I found you did not advertise this online or any other social websites.
