Its clear Sionyx has no intent of improving there software. It's 2022 this isn't acceptable if you want to use \"military quality\" as an advertising slogan with your cameras. I won't be recommending your products."

          "Contenu": "Bought one of the new Nightwave cameras and I was excited to see its performance. Shortly after mounting and deciding to move it to another location on the boat, I discovered that water was leaking into the base. I snapped the base back on as instructed and poured water over the top for a short time, and removed base to verify. Water was again present so it\u2019s obvious there is an issue. I contacted Sionyx and advised them of the problem and was told I would be provided a return label for it to be repaired. After a couple days after not receiving the return label, I contacted them again and was told it would be coming soon. After 10 days and 2 more contacts I am still getting the runaround. I then contacted the dealer I bought it from, they also contacted  Sionyx, and they appear to be getting the same delays. I have now requested a replacement as I am concerned that if I get the same delays once they finally receive it, it may be months before I get it back. It\u2019s unfortunate, because this may be a great product in the end, but they need to seriously look at the procedures if they expect to survive. Hopefully they will finally make this right."

I opened the box to charge the camera thought I was charging it the right way but found out the next day that I have to plug the usb to a port /lab top to charge the camera. Strike one !Spoke with an agent on the phone and was trying to explain to me that the compartment comes out to put the battery inside and had me pull out the plastic part instead where u put your eye to look. It was the wrong part I pulled out. I was afraid to break anything which I explained to him are u sure but he insisted and it was the wrong part I pulled out. I got a little frustrated. Thought it would be common sense or user friendly to get set up which it\u2019s definitely NOT !! So far it\u2019s strike number 2.  I really was excited to use this camera but not so excited now cause it\u2019s day number 2 and still haven\u2019t gotten the camera to work yet !!!!!!The Company had to have better instructions that come with the box instead of having agents explaining this over the phone or requesting to go on a zoom call to explain which is perfectly fine. I\u2019m on my way out the door having no time to go on zoom. I guess what I\u2019m trying to explaining is this is taking way too long to simply get this camera to charge and having to place the battery into the camera to function. Not a good experience so far for an expensive piece of equipment. John"

You have to remove from the firearm then remove from the mount to make a battery change.  The first battery took over 14 hours to charge and lasted only 30 minutes before going dead.  The second battery took 4 hours to charge and lasted just under an hour.  I guess someone else must have received this and also returned it.  The box has without question been opened.  Even when it says Wi Fi connected the app say camera not connected.  Purchased from Optics Planet"

After I had already pitched it I noticed on my purchase order that it said nothing about the rail mount being included. After researching I found that I had to fill something out with my proof of purchase and that I may not receive it for up to 6 weeks. I was not aware that this was a rebate offer as it clearly states that the rail mount or illuminator was free with purchase and nowhere did it say anything about a rebate or needing to fill out additional information. My issue isn\u2019t that it is a rebate nor that I might have to wait 6 weeks, my issue is that I ordered the camera thinking that the rail mount would be sent out with my camera so I could utilize it right after receiving. Had I known or it was clearly stated that it was a rebate I would have just ordered the rail mount to be sure I got it when I received my camera. I contacted someone from your service department and he was absolutely no help just stating that it was a rebate and seemed like he had no interest in helping me at all. This being my first time purchasing with this company I have to say that I\u2019m not very satisfied especially after spending over $500 on one item. Thank you for your timeBrian culver804-721-7063"

          "Contenu": "Ok, I don't like to leave bad reviews needlessly, but this is too much. I bought a Pro model several weeks ago to use as a night scope for pigs on some property I own. The first and most misleading statement is that this is \"full color\" night vision. Put simply it's not at all full color. It's slightly colorized. The thing that pushed me over the edge to finally buy it is that the needlessly expensive rail mount and illuminator were included for free as part of a March Madness sale. Here's the second problem. You have to fill out some rebate form which isn't something that is just there for you to fill out. You have to seek it out. This is clearly so you'll put it off and forget about it. Well I didn't forget. Then they tell you you'll get your stuff in ~6 weeks. I got the extras today, and the rail that they sell for FIFTY DOLLARS  is the male side of a picatinny. You can't attach it to a standard rail on its own. It's 100% useless. What they have pictured on their site is the appropriate set up, but that's not what you'll receive, so now you'll have to buy some other adapter to actually be able to mount it to a rifle. I want to return this. I don't even want it anymore. There are cheaper better alternatives out there. PLEASE do not give this company your money. I also want to point out I'm not some grouchy old man that doesn't know how things work. I'm 30, and I have a pretty good grasp on reality. I promise you don't want this thing for 1000 dollars. Oh also, their app is riddled with connectivity issues. I have the newest iPhone, so I really doubt it's on the phone's side. I actually took pictures of how silly this set up is, but there's not an option to upload them here. Furthermore, their return policy is good for 14 days, which is about 4 weeks short of how long it actually took them to send me the second portion of my order. They also graciously stick you with a 15 percent restocking fee. You know because it costs more to put the pro model back on the shelf than it would the cheaper ones, and then they even allow you to pay the return shipping on a product you're not happy with, so I've basically tossed ~200 bucks now for literally nothing. I'm really really disappointed in this transaction and product top to bottom.Edit: I will give them credit where it is due. They did not hold me to the 15% restocking fee. They did however stick me with the return shipping since I was having \"buyer's remorse\" as he put it rather than the product being underwhelming. I still would never recommend this product to anyone, but I do appreciate the refund, and I do think they were as helpful as one could expect all things considered."

Both are equally bright on the camera and the cheaper light has a square beam when you zoom way in, but I personally don't mind it. The cheaper light also has a more uniform beam at wider angles. The other light won't attach to the rail mount adapter, which is a downside, but unless you really need the more covert 950 nm, I don't see how the Sionyx light is worth the price.`"

When things settled down just a bit and I remembered about the rebate it had ended the week before. I contacted the company and asked for a little leeway on the date. No reply at all. Mind you, they contacted me daily during the period I was considering purchasing it. They were very responsive to sell the things, no so much after that. I would give the device 3 stars, mostly due to the short battery time and difficulty of charging the second battery. i give the company 1 star for pure greed and lack of compassion. Knowing what I now know about them and my current financial situation, I would not make this purchase again. Sure could have used that rebate"

Sionyx makes claims that it offers a date/time stamp. This is misleading. Sionyx actually has a one time non-visible date and time creation stamp embedded in its hidden metadata. NOT A VISIBLE OR CONTINUOUS OVERLAY OF THE DATE/TIME. Therefore, if you just want see better at night - it works. BUT if you need to create court friendly evidence by video documenting at night - prepare to have your butt handed to you in court. Easy to manipulate the record that is hard to show. Easy to edit the evidence without proof of tampering. Easy to get your evidence thrown out of court. Sadly, Sionyx customer service is terrible and unsympathetic stating only that they \"have no plans\" to correct or improve this issue. As a result, a 5 star product earns my 2 star review because the company continues to market itself to law enforcement types knowing that it isn't providing what the industry requires. That being said, if I can find a work around to make the videos taken court-ready, I would buy more of their units. But as it stands - it's a pretty toy - not a game changer."

The screen does pick up a full color view of what your looking at. However the screen is small and there is a lag to real time. Also the screen cause my eyes to unadjust to the natural night vision as the screen sends a lot of light into the eye. So when you take camera away from your eye your left with a over exposed Retina. Okay for the money I would recommend spending more and getting real night vision equipment for hunting or shooting. This works well as a night vision viewing scope."

You have to go online or download the manual. Sometime when I'm in the field there is no cell service to review the manual. Third and a big one, there is no lens cover. The objective lens is just sticking out front, if you carry it in your bag be sure to be careful.But it is a pretty interesting device.

          "Contenu": "I bought an original Aurora with the pre-holiday sale.  There was something weird with my card, and I finest you all about it - the responses were prompt and professional.  The camera was shipped quickly and arrived promptly - good stuff.  Even dealing with the rebate and illuminator taking awhile to ship, Justin was responsive and helpful. Again, great customer service.The bad?  I was sent a survey shortly after getting my camera.  In that survey I let y'all know that it was kind of obnoxious to keep the Pro model unavailable through the holiday sale, only to make it available for purchase pretty much immediately after the \"holiday sale\" ended.  I can guess at why you folks did this - clear out the stock on products there's going to be much much less interest in as soon as the Pro is available - from the consumer end, it was a frustrating move.  I, like many others, would have skipped the holiday sale and just gotten the pro had you made it available before the holidays.But what was particularly unprofessional was the response I got from William, who seemed personally offended by my feedback.   Through a series of emails, he offered to \"buy back\" my camera if I wasn't happy with it.  It was like pulling teeth over the course of something like 8 emails back and forth to get the details of what this \"offer\" actually was (he neglected answering my really straightforward questions to clarify what was being offered through multiple emails) - he didn't mean a return and then an exchange/refund - Will meant I would send my camera back to be assessed by him, and he would then pay some amount to be determined based upon inspection that I could then apply towards a Pro.It would have been better of William had just taken my criticism as helpful customer feedback - I was fine with my purchase, just a little put off by having bought a product that was almost instantly no longer top-shelf.  Instead we had this bizarre exchange that left me questioning whether I'd want to deal with, or recommend you folks again.  If Will was going respond and offer something, the customer friendly response would have been to offer an immediate exchange and send me the invoice to pay the difference in cost FYI. Not responding would have been just fine too, and then all I'd remember were the good interactions."

          "Titre": "Aurora not-so-Pro",
          "Contenu": "Overall this product was a disappointment for the money spent and there was clearly a lack of attention put into human engineering or operational application.  It does have good color night vision and functions as described in that regard.  The images are also far sharper than any image intensifier based device.  While the image quality is good, the night/twilight/day selector is small and difficult to manipulate even without gloves, and the lens adjustment is easily bumped out of position when attempting to adjust the N/T/D switch.  This is definitely below par for hunting or tactical use due to the direction arrow controls being so small, making them difficult to manipulate when wearing all but nitrile gloves or perhaps tight fitting pilot\u2019s gloves.  Typical Nomex gloves or Mechanix type protective gloves will make this problem worse.  It is also a sound and light discipline disaster, due to readily visible green and red LED\u2019s on initial startup, combined with a zingy noise.  You shouldn\u2019t have to be an operator to realize this; any hunter or surveillance specialist will pick this out as a problem immediately. This will give away your position day or night so attempting to use this for law enforcement, security, or military surveillance is a mission failure waiting to happen.  These should be disabled from the start and require a menu selection to enable them.  Another point of failure is loading and unloading the battery.  The rear end has to be removed and has no retaining cord, strap, or cable.  If you were attempting to change batteries in a moving vehicle or during a high stress situation, this could easily get away from you, possibly putting your NVD out of action.  The release lever for the end cap / battery access is also very difficult to operate when you are wearing gloves, probably impossible for someone with big fingers plus gloves.  The \u201cinstructions\u201d are a flimsy folded piece of paper with tiny printing that is difficult to read in all but bright light conditions.  For the amount of money this cost I\u2019m irritated that Sionyx couldn\u2019t provide an instructional CD or mini-disc with a PDF instruction manual, let alone print a proper instruction booklet, even in black and white.  I\u2019ve paid less for other NVD\u2019s and IR/visible lasers that come with a paper manual that provides more information in a format that doesn\u2019t require magnifiers to read comfortably. It also wouldn\u2019t have cost the manufacturer too much to throw in one of the Picatinny mounts with the package deal, especially since another manufacturer sells 3 different heights for $1 more.  Next time, Sionyx, please do better research and look at some mil-spec gear to avoid the problems inherent to the Aurora not-so-pro."

Works well in low light, works well with illuminator, does a commendable job of trying to convert the dark into correct chromatic color.  I gave it 4 stars because for this scope to make the leap it needs within the market it needs 2 things.  First a digitally adjustable sight reticle as found on the ATN products.  Second, the eye relief/focal point needs to be increased so that the eye doesn\u2019t have to be so close to the display.  This would allow for recoil with a black eye.  SiOnyx has done a great job with this scope but these two features will greatly enhance the scope\u2019s use ability for the hunting market."

          "Contenu": "Ok so first off true night vision? No, will you get green eye using it? Also no, however a swivel mount is essential as you will get black eye, how long that takes depends on how high the brightness has been tuned. I'm hoping to purchase a few more battery packs, as the charge time is unclear, and battery life out of the box is likely not 8hrs, if charging for 5 hours(out the box) doesn't charge the battery to full. In complete darkness this device is extremely risky, and should not be used, stick to your PVS14s, however if a (IR or otherwise) illuminator can be used safely I highly recommend this device. Rifle mounted this device performs admirably, in conjunction with a zeroed PEQ15 it can replace your day sight and will basically be a laser, however again the context is LUME, no lume you have to use your flood or another light source, generally speaking great device, however there are shortcomings, however this device is great fun, and I look forward to teaching about it this weekend. I think this is a great hunting tool, as long as it's paired with a IR laser and flood.The key issue I'm having is mounting options and charge time, the mounting process to helmet isn't clear and I've sent an email, hope to hear from them soon. I bought this for personal use, I bought it to product test and introduce it to other service members, and teach about this specific product at my unit, I am in the military, and I am in no way endorsed or affiliated with Sionyx."

The camera itself is amazing, especially for the price. While not PVS-14 gen 3 quality, it\u2019s still well worth the price. I highly recommend having an IR source when shooting on moonless nights.

With a new moon i.e.(no moon) it is difficult but not impossible to see in totally dark situations but I expected that. Overall for the cost the unit serves as a good NV and as a bonus the NV does work very well with AIMPOINT or EOTECH or other similar laser projection gunsights with the Sionyx picatinny rail system which is a very well made metal quick mount option. The case is sturdy and the unit charges appropriately.  No complaints at this time."

Bill was also able to answer a technical question regarding cowitness height when the Pro is mounted on the optional picatinny rail as 1.5\" which makes it halfway between typical absolute cowitness height and 1/3 cowitness height. The only reason for four stars is inability to get basic information from the website where user manuals would not drop in pdf format and could only access information in a small site pop-out window. I also had an issue confirming that the site processed my March Madness because the form would only reset on submission without providing any confirmation however Bill was again very quick to confirm after contacting him. I recommend to utilize site email tool for any questions.Purchased the Pro out of curiosity with plan to eventually invest in thermal/3P equipment, maybe this will allow SIONYX to further develop the Aurora (hunting/tactical applications) and challenge these more expensive technologies and extend battery life."

I would happily give five stars I could fix the external battery bug without buying a another camera. I upgraded my external battery to a Anker PowerCore 13000. With the latest Aurora Black, I can leave it attached to battery. No need to disconnect. The Anker turns on when the Auroura is switch on. With a UGREEN  1.5 ft. USB cable and a Duttek Micro USB splitter cable, the installation on a bump helmet with cover is super clean because I was able to thread the cable (with a little effort) through the webbing loops and re-lace the elastic bungee cord . Also, the splitter allows me to disconnect the cameras and remove the whole unit from the helmet without disturbing the rest of the cable assembly. Hopefully, Sionyx will include the external battery on / off - plug / unplug fix in the next update. I am proof they have it."

It is an amazing monocular, I can see clearly in almost complete darkness. without the unit I can not see anything. So, as-far as the unit functioning, it does what they say it will. My issue and biggest complaint is i wanted to use this as a tactical helmet mounted monocular, I have backup battery ready to go and purchasing an IR illuminator. BUT cant use any of that because I'm having to figure some crazy way of connecting the night vision to my helmet. Its SO disappointing that I have to jump through hoops ordering connection pieces from 3 different manufactures and from Great Britain at a HUGE cost just to mount the thing to my helmet...this is ridiculous.The checkout process was good and the 4 pay by Klarna was very helpful. I contacted support about the 100$ rebate and they are processing that as well. I just wish there was a suitable easy connection system for my helmet or rifle. I'm not happy that the connection system with all needed parts are gonna cost as much as the Aurora itself, once its all said and done... For that I could have just went ahead and bought the PVS-14 Gen 2"

          "Contenu": "The product arrived in plenty of time after ordering. The case that it was shipped in is a very robust pelican type case that is very durable and is great protection for the product. The contents were fully intact and well protected. Upon opening the case, I was disappointed that there were no product description/operating instructions. Even military systems like this come with operating instructions. I had to go to the product website to download instructions.  Once I had downloaded the operating instructions, it was fairly simple to get the device up and running once the batteries were charged.  After loading the mini card to set up the device, it was just a matter of going through the different operating modes and set them all up. This was not a bad process.  1. The daylight mode was decent, as one would expect. I did notice a bit of lag while moving the device from at a medium motion side to side. Upon mounting it to my m4, (I also purchased the mount), the picatinny rails fit nicely with no excessive movement. We fired 5 rounds and observed there was just a bit of \u201cbounce or jarring\u201d, probably due to the recoil of the rifle. 2. During dusk and night operations the device, (aurora), was able to easily acquire targets at 100yds. Again, the \u201cbounce\u201d was noticed during firing. At complete darkness, a scintillating effect was notice even after adjusting the forward and aft focusing features. A scintillating sight picture was observed at 100yds. This was cleared up much better with an IR light. When using an IR light/laser device we observed that there was a loss of the color feature of the device. We used streamlight and surefire IR laser/light systems. It was observed that we were not as accurate at 100yds while using the device at full darkness. Synopsis: The device is worth the price but it does have a learning curve to properly use it. The fact that there are no operating instructions when it was received is disappointing. The company is not very specific on the ability to attach this to a helmet or a headband device.  All and all this device will work for individuals looking to acquire a good night vision device."

Around the docks in the marina, rocks when lobstering around the jetties, or navigating home offshore at night - the Nightwave makes life easier. I\u2019m a huge fan of redundancies & tech that makes fishing/boating safer and that\u2019s what this product does. And at a much much more affordable cost than other competitors. Big fan!"

          "Contenu": "Honestly didn\u2019t expect this to be all that great, knowing up front is is best during partial moon.  The night it arrived there wasn\u2019t any moon showing and as expected it needed the IR light, but wow it was clear.  The next night I was able to get out during twilight, and could only see about 100\u2019 with my own eyes.  When I put this on twilight and night mode and WOW could I see with now help from the IR light, way into the tree line over 100 yards (not feet).  I am so glad I took the plunge on buying this, and that it wasn\u2019t a frivolous purchase.  BTW I own high end NVG and am always concerned about burning the intensifier in urban or street lit settings.  This fits the bill perfectly with no risk to the device.  Oh and the added memory size is a huge help Inwasnt aware of during purchase."

          "Contenu": "Buying an Aurora through SiOnyx is easier and less complicated than trying to buy it through a reseller(like Amazon). Resellers have restrictions on where the product is sent. Not so with SiOnyx. The only concern I had, was with the shipper they chose. First notification, on day of delivery, stated I could expect delivery between 1:00 & 3:00 pm. Then, after 3:00 came and went, the update stated the delivery would be before 7:00 pm. Aurora was finally delivered close to 6:00 pm. The last time I had a delivery by this shipper, I got the same messages, only to find out they had put the package on the wrong truck. I\u2019m not holding SiOnyx responsible for this, but they might want to use a more reliable shipper, like FedEx or the US Postal Service. The product however has exceeded initial expectations and further testing needs to be conducted."

          "Contenu": "SiOnyx Pro is a great little package. Will be using this camera for hiking and outdoors surveillance at night. After the first few trials in my backyard I am beyond pleased with its performance. Digital zoom is a little up for discussion, I would rather see a true mechanical zoom on this even if it was 2x or up to 4X max then use digital zoom for up to 8X. I know it would add weight and size but I think it would keep the resolution a little higher. The optional IR illumination kit is no joke and really fills in the room when used indoors, spot focus is read well on the SiOnyx outdoors as a spot light. App interface is quick and lightweight when you need to transfer photos fast and share what you are seeing. In less than 2 minutes I can snap turn on my SiOnyx, link to phone and send to a friend what I am seeing. A+. I'd say for most situations I need this unit, ill be very happy. Only would've liked the ability to pull manual zoom for spotting in distance 200yrds. digital zoom seems to be a crop of full frame exposure so you cant get detail in the zoomed area if a branch reflects the IR back to the camera in the full frame without zoom. Make spotlight on IR and try to do several experiments and still tricky to get good focus at 200yrds on digital zoom. When you turn of digital zoom you can see better with exposure but my eyes struggle to identify objects at 200yrds since you are looking at less pixels on the screen. Detection is great (good screen refresh rate) but classification is tricky (pixel density)."

With the Aurora Pro, the night sky comes alive with thousands of stars. Even when I get some street lighting bleeding into the viewer. You can darken or lighten your view.

          "Contenu": "I recently received the SiOnyx Pro night vision camera.  I am beyond impressed with its usefulness for my intended use.  For shooting the night sky, it does a great job of effectively gathering the low light required to record stars and the Milky Way.  When you consider the size, cost and the fine build quality of their cameras, it\u2019s a definite recommendation from me.I had read some user reviews where there was disappointment when the camera was used in a completely dark environment.  Any device, like the SiOnyx Pro, needs some small degree of light \u2013 but not much \u2013 just enough for the camera to amplify what we can barely perceive to something truly visual.  With this in mind, it does what it claims to do very well!The camera has a few settings that allow you to take control of the camera -- allowing you to adjust the brightness of your recordings, manual focus, frame rate choices, and more.  It\u2019s a simple devise to use.  And, the small size and light weight make it an easy camera to have with you at all times, allowing you to quickly capture those unexpected moments.  But beyond praise for the camera, their company has the best customer support EVER!  I required a fair bit of information about the Pro model vs. other cameras in their product line.  All questions were answered with astonishing speed.  It\u2019s evident that they care about the user experience \u2013 taking pride in what they have developed, and what they offer.  Thanks for the great SiOnyx Pro.  And thanks too for helping me with your A+++ customer support which helped me with my purchasing decision."

          "Contenu": "I use your camera constantly and as an important part of my private investigator business.  Customer Service wanted me to return my camera in spite of it just needing a .25 plastic part.  I was a little scared and disappointed that I had to send the camera back when I could\u2019ve easily fixed it myself with the correct part.  I just didn\u2019t want to be without the camera for an extended time.  I sent the camera 2 day UPS and insured it for $800.  Sionyx replaced my camera, and threw in two batteries, and a charger cord.  They sent it back and it was in my hands within five days (two of which were Saturday and Sunday) from when I dropped it off at UPS.  All in all the experience was great and worked out fine.  I do wish Sionyx would keep some simple parts on hand, but this worked out great.  I use this camera constantly and it\u2019s a great camera and clients love my video work product.  In fact I\u2019m going to be adding a Sinoyx Pro to my stable of cameras and I have no concern that Sionyx will support their cameras and customers.  In my business, time truly is money, and I\u2019m very pleased that Sionyx understands this and works hard to met customer requirements.  I\u2019m looking forward to my new Sionyx Pro in the near future.  A special thank you to Bill (head of customer service) for taking the effort and extra time to support my needs.Tim Schmidt"
