          "Contenu": "At 3:22 p.m. on December 8, 2023, I contacted TNT, (877 287 5256) because I was interested in purchasing an internet plan, applying a school discount. I spoke with the advisor Jose Perez, he told me about the promotion and assured me that I would pay a maximum of 15.00 per month. He informed me that I should contact Earthlink today, December 9, for said discount (866 383 3080). At 11:47 am I talk to Sara and she tells me that it is another value. That they do not apply a school discount. For me it is super annoying to hear that I had to pay almost 60.00 monthly. That is to say, they changed all my information. It is a lack of respect for the client and the trust that one expects to be correct. Reason why I decide to cancel the plan. I hope for a refund and that they take action in this situation."

Once he got me to say ok to the order, he used a fake address to push the order through so that Allconnect would get the credit. Once I got the order confirmation from Verizon I realized the address was wrong, and I had wasted all this time setting this up.  Verizon told me he sold me a incomplete package and that it was not properly priced out and that it was going to cost me a significant amount of additional money for the monthly charges.

Also the website says that the modem is free in one spot but under provider details it says that there is a $15 rental fee per month. Unable to explain this I decided to not sign up with Allconnect and went straight to the Brightspeed website where I found that there is a rental fee and that I don't have either the 30 or 50mbps speeds available but only 15mbps! I am very glad that I didn't sign up with Allconnect thinking that I was getting 50 when the company doesn't even offer it in my area. Don't trust Allconnect for sure."

After that he kept trying to get me to sign up for other thing we did talk about internet because I still need to sign up for that but he said that $60 a month was the cheapest plan out there and at first I said okay and we continued but then I told him never mind before we got to far into billing and when not. I did my own research and internet is cheaper than $60 and he still put it through and I got a notification to continue it even though I didn\u2019t want to. When I told him I didn\u2019t want to continue and gave him my reasons, pricing, needed to do my own research he sounded annoyed and got pushy. I repeatedly told him I was at work and had to go to see my patient but he would not let me go so finally I had to apologize to him and just hang up. I didn\u2019t like my experience with him after the internet help. He was to pushy and seemed like he was only trying to get something out of me."

Allconnect is a 3rd party company, go directly to the actual company to set up service!  Allconnect will give you the run around and does not care if you are getting what you want to order as long as they can make the sale."

This is incredibly shady. I did not consent to giving this company my personal information and was told again by the agent that this was a part of the Duke process to complete my energy hook up, in an apparent attempt to keep me on the line to sell me internet and other services.

          "Contenu": "I was directly transferred to AllConnect by my electric company AEP Ohio after I set up electric service for our new home. At first, the AllConnect agent claimed he was only verifying my information on behalf of AEP Ohio to make sure my name was spelled correctly and so on. Soon after he verified my information that AEP sent to them (more like sold to them...), he tried to sell me other services unrelated to electric services. For example, he wanted to sell me discounted internet, all the while claiming he wasn\u2019t selling anything at all. And then he said he would spam my email account with information on how to setup mail forwarding with USPS. Without first explaining to me what AllConnect even is, why I need them, what my obligation (if any) to AllConnect is, or any other basic information about the company, he made it sound as if he was now the curator of my relocation to a new home. At no point did he ask for my consent. Quite the opposite. I kept questioning their business model (e.g., middleman? reseller? kickbacks? ), but he pushed back against this kind of questioning and insinuated that I was being rude for daring to interrupt his substantive sales pitching with my more fundamental \u201cwho even are you\u201d line of questioning. Ultimately, this guy actually hung up on me. I called AEP to provide feedback that this so-called \u201cpartnership\u201d is absolutely ill-advised and that AEP should somehow track down the AllConnect agent I spoke with and also obtain the call recording to study it. My feedback was well-received by AEP. Oh and I also informed AEP that I suspect AllConnect of having predominantly fake reviews on TrustPilot. Many reviews have all of the hallmarks of fakeness, e.g., scripted sounding language that sounds more like an ad than a real consumer experience, intentional syntax/grammar mistakes to look authentic, bland one-sentence reviews left by TrustPilot accounts that only have 1 total review (presumably to raise the overall star rating), etc. There is absolutely no way that a legitimate consumer would leave these guys anything more than 0 reviews. Also, given the utterly useless business model they have, I find it ridiculous that they have more than 1300 ratings."

She apologized and said I did not have direct tv, I was signed up for YouTube tv. She also advised I did have optimum internet, confirmed my tech appointment for Sunday and gave me the customer service number for optimum. I had written a prior review but don\u2019t see it here. So in my prior review I spoke too soon about Sofie.  I called optimum and they had no record of my account. So I set up my account and saved $100 by not having a tech come to install the equipment. Sofie also confirmed my service appointment on June 18th. I hope no one shows. I put my credit on lock down because I think this organization is scamming some how. Call the companies themselves. This \u201cSERVICE\u201d is nothing to rave about or trust"

It was not clear to me that this was a separate company from Xcel. It turned in to a \"hard sell\" sales pitch for internet service. After a 45 minute phone call it turned out that their \"great deal\" was the same price as service offered on the front page of the ISPs website and I'm wondering why Xcel is trying to sell me internet service? I kept asking if my account was set up without getting a real response. I had to call Xcel back today to get actual useful information like my account number and how to access online billing and that my account was actually set up at all.Speaking of phone calls, this lovely company decided to sell my number to every spammer on the planet. I typically get a spam call or two a week but in the last day since I had the misfortune of speaking with allconnect I have received over a dozen. Can't make this up, as I'm writing this I'm getting another spam call.I will say I do not blame the representative I was talking to as I think it's just a crappy gig and she was attempting to be friendly and helpful. In terms of choosing an ISP, they are de facto monopolies or duopolies in most areas so I really don't see why this company even exists.I have a big problem with this company as well as Xcel who dumped me onto them. They now have my name, address, phone number, SSN, and email and apparently are more then willing to drown me in spam. I filed a complaint with Xcel and I sent an email complaint to allconnect today."

          "Contenu": "Nothing went wrong. The name \"Allconnect\" is simply a misnomer. When I set up my account with VA Domion Power I was told about Allconnect and what a great service it was. That came after I had already set up my Washington Gas account. I let them transfer me to allconnect anyway and spent an hour on the phone with a representative who was friendly, willing, and apparently willing to accommodate any and all of my wishes regarding internet and TV. I told her what I was looking for she told me I got it all. The only thing lacking was any confirmation in writing showing what we had agreed upon. Since we weren't moving for a few weeks, and she assured me nothing was due until the date set, I figured nothing could go wrong.Well, instead of the EarthLink device being delivered \"a few days prior to activation\" it arrived a solid 7 weeks early while I was in Texas.  Fortunately I was having some work done at the house so the workers took the router inside.When I got to Virginia I discovered I had EarthLink for internet but no TV contract. I contacted Allconnect. There was no record of a previous conversation or anything. I started anew with this representative,  Jenny  (I think). After almost an hour and a half we concluded the conversation. I got most of what I wanted. I made a couple of errors in listing  the channels we wanted, and a couple were omitted because Jenny didn't listen. Unfortunately,  it is your policy -apparently- to confirm only after commitment to the service so we only found out after the fact. When I asked my wife if we should call back and change or cancel she said we should stay with what we had as my wife didn't have the energy to go through this again. Nonetheless, the whole ordeal was less than satisfying. Jenny read the disclaimers and disclosures so fast that I ( and I presume anybody) would have only gotten 10% of what she read to me. The fact that I received an email with the same disclosures/disclaimers that I could read \"at my leisure\" didn't help. Only after requesting clarification on the statement \"there is no contract\" did we find out that what we presumed to be month-to-month was, in all actuality, a binding 24 month commitment that if canceled prior to the end of the 24 month period would in fact incur a $20/month early cancelation charge. That sounds like a contract to us.I understand that a salesperson is supposed to sell things but having been on the after sales side in various companies in service departments for over 35 years,  I can vouch for the fact that many customers become ex-customers because the company and service departments will not or cannot keep promises made by the sales departments"

So I did.  And then I saw all the negative reviews about Allconnect.com and got scared.  A quick search found that Spectrum also serviced our area for about the same price but roughly 4 times the speed.  So instead of saving me time I wasted time cancelling my HughesNet set up.  I don't necessarily think I was intentionally lied to, but regardless of the intentions the rep I talked to didn't have good information.  We'll see if I get spammed with emails or phone calls with offers but so far I haven't been."

It is a throttle down to less than 1 Mbps and then a complete cutoff after 110% of your data package has been reached.
