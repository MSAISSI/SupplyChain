Once your representative came on line it was very hard to understand him The background noise was overwhelming. I understand it was a call center, but there is no excuse for such loud noise. My suggestion is to have on the web, same feature that (apparently) are on the app. Change contracted call center or have them working from home so that people can hear and understand them; also 90 minutes waiting is not really acceptable. Do not believe me, PLEASE call yourself and see what happens. Over all I hope that the representative was able to initiate the porting of the number."

And then Truconnect takes their time.  So be prepared to be without a phone.  Almost immediately upon switching to Truconnect I felt it was a mistake.

I changed phone companies because I didn\u2019t want to deal with not being able use my phone. Now it looks like I\u2019m dealing with it again unfortunately. It sucks because you guys seem like a great phone company, but not where I live I guess. So you need to improve your signal quality in the country because it definitely doesn\u2019t like to receive signal. Other than that, you guys have been a great company."

They asked me if I knew my pin and I know I set one.    Instead, again, I was talked to like I was stupid, he told me the pin, it ended up being the last 4 digits of my social so they obviously defaulted my answer to that.    Again a lack of organization, makes me wonder who and how are they handling the applicationsOther than having to deal with the pettyness the service is working well.    I guess it's a hiring issue, probably has a group of lazy college graduates who never worked a real job in their life."

They are a waste of time, they have no ability to assist with lifeline issues and give you an 800 number that they know can't help you either. I don't know what they are even there for.Also my screen broke on my phone, there is nothing they will do to help and want $80 for an equivalent phone, $50 for trash or $30 for a flip phone.They know many of these phones are going to the disabled but don't provide or offer cheap cases for phones that stores do not carry cases for and there is no return or exchange, no repairs..I'm on disability, I can't even afford a phone, it's why I'm here.. so obviously I don't have any money.. I just want a device that's not broken. There is glass in my pockets all the time and you can see the hold strip that connects the camera, I had to remove the screen protector just to make the screen respond to touch at all bc it broke that bad.When I'm able to eventually get another free phone, I will order it from another provider and switch my service to them if truconnect doesn't send me another phone to replace this one soon."
