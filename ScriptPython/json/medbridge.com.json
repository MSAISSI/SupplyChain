Another thing....why is the access code for pts tied to the user who created the exercise program?  We have PTA that see our pts and we cannot add on to the pt's exercise program with different user names.  The access code should be unique to each pt and therefore, allow multiple users to contribute to that one access code.  I hope this review helps to improve your program.  Otherwise, I really love the exercise and pt education info available to give to pts."

I see patients in 30 or 60 minute blocks, which means having to waste time re-logging in 10-12 times a day. I wish I could have the exercise page opened all day which makes it easier for me to show patients their exercises then quickly add and update their list without having to waste precious time re-logging in. That's the only gripe I have. Otherwise I'm happy with the website."

If I took a course where the presenter read the notes or read the PowerPoint slides to me, I finished the course and moved on to something else. I gave my review after each course so you already know what I think: you have excellent presenters, good presenters, fair presenters, and poor presenters. Some of the presentations sent me back to research ideas and concepts that I forgot or never knew and I wanted more than what was in the presentation. The more I worked with the material the more I understood. These were the best presentations."
