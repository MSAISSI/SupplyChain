          "Titre": "Definitely not worth the price paid.",
          "Contenu": "The flash drives are cheap, flimsy, and overall a huge disappointment. The picture is completely shifted, stretched, and out of focus, despite asking them to fix it but they never did. They sent me a picture for approval before shipment. I noticed the image was not centered so I asked them to fix it, and they literally just took a different picture of the same drives the next day without reprinting. They already had printed the entire order before even sending me the picture for approval, so I don't know what the point was of me approving anything. Definitely not worth the price paid. Overcharged for thin, flimsy plastic with a skewed image. The drives were shipped directly from China, so I doubt the company really even sees the final product in person. I highly doubt I will be ordering from this company again, and I do not recommend if they are your first choice. Do some research for other companies first before deciding on this one!*Update: since UMD wants to be defensive, I actually did not receive a sample of the drive I ultimately ordered. If I did, I most definitely would not have gone with that choice. Second, the drive is literally 2\" in diameter, and the image provided is much larger especially in dpi. I don't understand how you can shrink an image and it still comes out blurry. Lastly, I have not been reached out to and my order has not been fully refunded, so please reviewers do not believe everything that they respond with! Most of it is them trying to cover themselves."

I had no reason that I would receive a replacement before my deadline, so I used what I had. NOT a good presentation. They contacted me this year. I told them my problem and they swore that I'd be happy and gave me a discount. Like a fool, I bought their line and ordered again. A worse problem this time. When I called them, they told me I could reload the drives with new material. They were not interested it my returning the drives for new ones, offering me any compensation, NOTHING! When I asked if I understood correctly, that they would do nothing, my question was met with silence. They truly DO suck..."

Just reached out to Sales person to see response.I will update..After speaking with my Salesperson, We discovered that I in fact did order the 32 gig. So it way my error. My only concern, was that the drives were shipped from China and I was not told that. This took extra time. Also some of the drives did not write as the same speeds. Some are fast and some write slower. The final product is out the door and the customer will give me final feedback.With all that said. I will do business with them again."

I asked a few days prior if the package was shipped, and Amanda checked, but they didn't ship it till one day before the delivery date. Not her fault - but in my opinion, the company should ship it an extra day in advance to make sure they meet the client's delivery request. After I explained to them that I only ordered the product for this specific event, they ended up refunding me, which I think is a great and fair service on their part for this specific incidence."

I reached out to 2 other companies for this project, and they all paled in comparison to price, quality, and preferred design. Anikaris was professional, answered all my questions, and was extremely easy to work and communicate with. I have added her and USB Memory Direct to our company's preferred vendor list for future projects. I highly recommend this company and Anikaris for your USB needs."

Amanda was able to answer all our questions and promptly sent us our requested quote. Once we sent the camera ready art, per their specifications, she worked to speed up our delivery date. We were pleased with the delivery date she gave us, but I believe our flash drives actually arrived one day earlier than the promised date, so we were thrilled to be able to get them to our customer sooner. When we received them, they were perfect! Should the need arise, we will certainly use USB Memory Direct again! And we would like to thank Amanda directly for ensuring our experience was smooth and trouble free. Amanda made us feel like we were her only customer and old friends."

Sharing the production files was efficient, and turn-around on the digital proofs of product was fast.  We actually went with a different USB stick than we originally planned due to the different styles of proofs Daniel provided!  Once we approved our format/style, a very good turn around time on product and delivery.Thank you Daniel and USB Memory Direct!"
