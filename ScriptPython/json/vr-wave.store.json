The improvement wasn't as good as I expected; but, even worse, the right eye piece wouldn't stay on the Reverb Lense, it kept falling off. I actually had to tape it in place. I emailed the problem to VR support, and they asked me to make a video of it and send it back. Obviously, that was their way of deterring a customer complaint. I will be ordering a new pair of lenses from another source that has magnetic attachment."

          "Contenu": "The adapters are extremely difficult to put onto the quest pro because they have too many imperfections. Neither side has come out of their mold correctly. They also have the magnets placed incorrectly and lopsided so the rx lenses that stick on once the adapters are installed, do not sit flush creating an incorrect prescription angle/axis. The lenses themselves don\u2019t look great or provide much clarity. The plastic they\u2019re made of also rub black paint onto my face even after cleaning them repeatedly. It took me over half an hour to get the adapters on and I was only successful because I warmed the plastic slightly so they would fit over the quest pro gasket and into the grooves. (Yes I watched the installation video multiple times). I\u2019ve been wearing glasses for 35 years and had many types of lens adapters for all kinds of devices and do not consider myself new to clicking pieces of plastic together. If you\u2019re a multi player household and need to remove the magnetic lenses for each user, you\u2019re not going to have a good time with these. They\u2019re extremely finicky and fall off with the lightest touch or movement of the pd. I purchased from here because they were the only store with quest pro lenses available for purchase and regret it."

If yo do have problems, you are probably SOL! (Edit: they emailed my son and told him to break the lenses and video it then send them the video. He responded by pointing out their return policy says they will only issue a refund if the lenses are returned in the same condition they were received in. Interesting. So no, we will return them intact, in the packaging, the printed box as they were received. SMH...)"

Since I posted the review, VR Wave added a reply to the review which was very polite and asked me to get in touch so they could sort the problem out quickly. I did get in touch, four more times over 2 weeks and have received no communication back from them. It's clear that they use their reply on bad reviews to make it look like they quickly deal with issues but I can tell you this is not the case. I am still waiting for the correct order to be sent to me.Here's my original review...I ordered a pair of Quest lenses and due to my eye prescription being slightly strange (I have issues with my left eye), I followed up with an email explaining that although my prescription did not exactly match my order, I wanted the zero magnification lens for my left eye (to use as a lens protector). They replied quickly saying no problem. They shipped as per my prescription which is not what I asked for so I contacted them and did not receive a reply. I have since emailed them four times and not had a response. They were very quick to reply before I paid but once my money was in, nothing - not impressed. However, I must say the product itself is great."

Theyre sending a return label, trying out the lenses in the meantime in hopes it'd change my mind. Honestly though i havent really noticed a difference between these $70 vrwave lenses and the $20 lenses i got from amazon. Im sure if i actually needed a glasses prescription that these can come with these would be awesome, but for just the anti blue light and anti glare i havent noticed a difference at all honestly. Will update to 3 stars at least once i actually get the return label, send it back and get refunded-------------------------------------------I saw/heard about how good these lenses were from VR youtubers, these looked good so ordered them for the anti glare/blue light stuff, didnt need the glasses prescription part of it so it hurt that they were still $70 after shipping but still ordered anyways. Saw the same kind of anti glare/blue light lenses on amazon for $20 and ordered those in a heartbeat since its way cheaper since i didnt need the prescription part. Tried cancelling my order via support email and chat on the 12th. Today i still got this order anyways, never got an email back from support (after being told to contact the support email specifically by the chat on here) and still got charged the $70 anyways. Emailed support AGAIN and still not a single word from them. The lenses from here are good sure, but really only a better option than the MUCH cheaper alternatives if you need the prescription part as well, if not the cheaper versions on amazon work just as well and their customer support wont screw you over."

I used their chat portal on the site to request a refund/cancel the order, they said \"someone would contact me\".. a few days later someone did call me to tell me they would not be cancelling my orderer number, but they had shipped my products just now instead, and they do not have a tracking number for me, apparently it is coming from China, which I would have never ordered if I knew that fact, no instead they say on the site the products ship from the US.   OK, so now it has been like 10 days and I still have no products, my order on their site says \"Paid, unfulfilled\" and I am not happy.   Will not order from vr-wave.store ever again, terrible shipping and terrible customer service.   Good luck!"

You can buy non-prescription lenses only for $30.Tried to understand this difference from customer service who was very snarky with me and only offered a 5% discount they give everyone for subscribing to the news letter.UPDATE:Companies response indicates prescription lenses can be purchased for $30; however, as soon as you add a prescription to the lenses, it jumps as I stated before.  Not sure how you can consider plain lenses without a prescription value \"Prescription\" Lenses.  Still a bait and switch tactic.My suggestion, stop lying to people.  Just put the base rate for PRESCRIPTION lenses and offer Plano lenses without a prescription for $30.  Prescription lenses start at $75 from what I can see."

After installing them, as per the YouTube instructional video produced by VR Wave, I noticed the image changed, but was not improved from before they were installed. I contacted VR Wave by replying to an email they sent me-they said I could contact them this way. I received no reply.I then went on their website and submitted to them my experience. Their reply was I should take the lenses to an optician to check if the prescription is accurate. I should not have to do this. It would probably cost more than the lenses and I don't know if I could find an optician that would do it. I sent them an image of the prescription from my ophthalmologist as they requested and I double checked the information I entered on the order form. The eyeglasses I purchased worked fine with this prescription. I replied to their response with the information I wrote above. I will update this review if I can."

I\u2019m only on day two with them so still feeling them out but so far I\u2019m kinda disappointed\u2026Update: While removing my headset the frames of the lenses actually cut my face. Working with support now, hopefully they can resolve this. If it keeps taking over a day for a response I\u2019m going to contact my lawyer but I don\u2019t want to do that so fingers crossed.Update 9-10-2021: Support has ghosted me. I feel like I maybe should sue them for the cut on my face. There was no warnings on the packaging that the lenses could cut you\u2026 since they don\u2019t want to fix the issues\u2026"

The rubber cups don\u2019t really attach to the eyepieces by anything other than slight tension and can also be easily dislodged by touching them. Not really impressed with them considering the price. They were only reading glasses type too, not prescription lenses.Update 29.1.2021As I said previously I can\u2019t fault their customer service and they quickly sent me a replacement set with no fuss. The first thing I noticed with the new ones was that the lenses were a lot more secure in the rubber cups, which tells me the original ones were defective and I was justified in my claim. All things said and done the product is excellent, including packaging and presentation, and you can rest assured that in the rare event something slips through quality control, they will rectify the issue swiftly."

The date was specific). I was told that if they were able to postpone they would inform me. They never did and shortly after I received an email saying they started production. I thought \"fine, I get it. They could have at least contacted me however.\" I didn't pursue the issue. Received 2 more emails in the coming weeks about how my product was almost ready to ship and in the final stages of production. More than a month after I placed the order I emailed customer service asking what the status was. I was THEN told that my order had not been started and was put on hold and asked me to confirm the prescription that I already sent and was never told needed to be confirmed or my order was postponed. I asked to cancel and refund my order and a week has passed and I have not heard back or received my refund. 0/10 customer service and ?/10 product. Will not recommend to anyone."

I tried looking through each one out of the headset. It appears the left lens is the issue. I emailed the company letting them know my problem. Several hours later I received an email with instructions on how to install the lenses. I emailed them back to insure them I had things installed properly. I was then asked to submit photos of the inserts installed. Which I did.  On 10/16 I received another email to let me know they received my photos and they were sending this forward to their production team. After not hearing anything for 5 days I again emailed the company on 10/21 to see what was up. Later that day I got another email. This time I was informed they had processed my replacement. And I should get another email with a tracking number within 3-5 days. After not hearing anything for another 5 days I emailed them on 10/26 asking whats up with my order. Later that day I got another email stating the same thing they told me 5 days prior. The response I sent them was \"Seriously? Thats what you told me a week ago\". 2 days later on 10/28 I was finally given a tracking number. So I finally received the replacement lenses last night 11/3. Before I placed my original order I contacted VR Wave asking about the new frame design for the quest 2 lenses. They informed me they did have a slimmer design that helped with the touching the nose issue. I just needed to place the order. Then send an email requesting the new design. Although there were issues with the prescription itself, the frame design was awesome. However when I received the replacements they were the old style frames. SERIOUSLY???? Thinking ok Ill just deal with it as long as they work I installed the lenses. When I put on the headset I realized the prescription was even worse than the first set. With the first set at least they got one lens right. This time both lenses were trash. As I said to them in my email, \"At this point all I know to say is WTH?. Please just tell me what I need to do to get my money back. I am happy to send both pair back at the companies expense\". I have seen a lot of people that are very happy with this company. But as far as Im concerned I DO NOT RECOMEND THIS COMPANY!!!!!!!! Please just give me my money back."

Beware buying anything else; their response is slow, almost designed to make you go away, or forget your issue. A had an issue with their halo headstrap; got one for my wife, she loves it. They change the design and is doesn't work for me. After exchanging an email - nothing. I guess I bought it. So beware, you press that button, you bought it.Update: a couple hours after this posted, I got a response from the company with an address where to return the product for a refund. I've upgraded my rating to 2 (I can't rate it at 2.5, and I'm not giving a 3) as they are not paying for shipping."

          "Contenu": "It would seem more thought has went into the design of the Quest 2 lenses than these HP Reverb G2 lenses.  The design is really not great with these lenses.  Some issues I found:The lens surrounds are made of rubber and have to be pushed on which is ok I guess.  However it's not clear in the instructions and videos how much you need to push on the lenses to get them to stay in place.  My first attempt I was pushing them in too far and they weren't staying in place and now I realize I was likely stretching the rubber too much.  My next attempt they weren't push in enough and were falling off.  My third attempt I twisted them a little while pushing them in slowly and eventually they stayed in place.Then I noticed I had some dirt on the lenses so took them off for a clean and both lenses popped out of the rubber!  So overall while these work once they are in place it is an extremely delicate design, which is very disappointing as I would like the ability to take the lenses on and off quickly to let others use the headset.Needs more work."

I usually keep my IPD on position 1 but wasn't able to get my headset tight to my face and was forced to use position IPD position 2 (not a huge deal for me since my IPD is actually dead center between position 1 and 2). After 1 hour of use I took the lenses out and just used my glasses because the discomfort was unbearable. In theory this sounded like a great idea but turned out to be a waste of $80. :("

          "Contenu": "I ordered the VR-Wave, AND VR Optician prescription lenses for my valve index. The first lenses I purchased was the VR WAVE lenses. The order was reasonably priced and it came VERY quickly. All of that was wonderful. At first glance I was impressed with VR-wave, but I soon really started to be bothered by the fact that I could only see very clear if I was looking straight ahead. Any time I tried to look around with my eyes (up, down, side to side), it is VERY blurry and so I thought that maybe this is how these type of lenses work. You must turn your head to look around, which was ok, I guess.  I had my doubts however, I mean, regular glasses allow you to look around without turning your head, right? SO I purchased a set of prescription lenses from VR Optician and it was a bit more expensive and took a few weeks to get here but WOW! They are like night and day as compared to the VR-wave lenses. I can see more clearly when looking straight ahead and I can see perfectly when looking around with my eyes too. I spent WAY too much money getting this right, and my only wish is that I had gone with VR-Optician first. They don't cut corners like VR-wave did. I gave VR-wave 2 stars only because the speed at which the lenses arrived from China. Otherwise, don't waste your money. I will be sharing my review of this everywhere I can so that you don't end up wasting your money! :)RobEdit: I forgot to mention, the design of the VR-wave lenses is awkward and has little bits of plastic that is very uncomfortable against your nose. I have a normal sized nose btw."

I declined as I have already ordered replacements (paid for expedited shipping for a reason and didn't want to prolong reordering any longer due to all the email back and forth). If they would have offered this initially I would have been very happy and posted a positive review, but 25% felt insulting to me. However, I did want to update the review that they tried and I will increase to 2 stars for the afterthought. I rarely make a negative review, but this one is called for. I ordered VR lenses. Clicked on the Oculus Quest 2 section. Put in all my information, scrolled back up to make sure I was on the Quest 2 and clicked \"add to cart.\" Where it went wrong is not checking that it was still on the Quest 2 after I added to cart. I should not have assumed that if I filled out the information under Quest 2 that it would change once it went to the cart. How silly of me. I was so excited when the package came. Pulled them out and noticed the shape wasn't correct. Reviewed the email and it said HP reverb. Again, silly of me not to triple check that it didn't change from my initial double check which makes this my fault which I understand and accept. I called customer service immediately. The lady said \"send an email.\" I don't want to send an email, I want to talk to someone about this. She said \"send an email, I am the only one here.\" So I asked her about returns, she said \"they are on a case by case basis but you have a product that you can't use so don't worry, they will get it figured out for you.\" She also said she would have someone call me within 24 hours to discuss but to still send the email. She even verified my phone number. No one called. I received a day and a half later that said since it was my error they could offer me a discount. Didn't even mention what the discount would be. So I asked. They responded another day later and said 25% and they would send me a code if I'm interested. No, I am not interested. I've spent 128 dollars (with shipping) and now I need to spend another 75 plus shipping? So over 200 for a 100 dollar product that I'm sure costs 25 dollars to manufacture. I would have easily agreed to a 50% discount but 25% feels insulting. So buyer beware that the website defaults to another system despite which system you are completing the form for and on top of that customer service is not knowledgeable and has wasted 3 days that I could have used to have another set of lenses being made because they insisted on email exchange instead of a phone call. I will be reordering from a different site. I would rather pay another company more than continue to deal with this one."

So actually they did a good job for find it out and emailed to me. Unfortunately, either I missed the email or the email arrived later. I just didn't see it for some reasons . Otherwise, it would save both of us a lot of resources and frustrations and we can get this resolved already. However, they had no one mentioned it to me or point it out during recent so many conversations (emails and phone calls). It could be avoid if we had more effective communication.Up to this point, I still have not received any response and solution from VR Wave. I hope we can have a better and effective communication in the future.***********************************************************************I placed the order for my lens on 2/2/2022 from VR Wave website and received it on 3/6/2022 since they shipped it from China or HongKong.But it is totally wrong prescription that I cannot see anything via the lens. After I contacted with VR Wave support by emails and I received the first email response was quite nice and asked me if I like them to make another one. But I asked to find out what's wrong with it. They told me that I put the wrong prescription data but didn't tell me how wrong and which numbers are wrong. I sent emails to ask them and never got the question answered and have no responses... I had to make several special trips to my eye doctor and eventually found out the prescription numbers I entered were all correct numbers but the only thing seems the wrong plus \"+\" sign and should be a negative \"-\" sign in front of the prescription numbers. Then I found their support phone number and called them but now they blamed me for entering the wrong data...and not willing to make a correct one or want me to pay the cost... But, honestly I don't think I put the wrong since I am a very careful guy with the numbers since I am a database expert and doing database development, administration and data architect works everyday for last 20 years. They also don't have any proven like screen shot that shows I entered the wrong numbers. I could be but I don't believe I did wrong in general case...However, like most customers, I am not am eye doctor or an optician. We could miss the significant of the meaning for the prescription numbers and those signs. But I wonder the technicians (in VR Wave Wave) should have common senses for it? Or even may raise a question if you have a doubt? That's what we do for our daily jobs. right?!Furthermore, should their website be designed more user friendly for all customers like adding a notice reminding customers for the difference between plus or negative sign? As up to date 3/24/2022 now, they still have not responded to me whether they willing to make another one pair for me or I have to pay for another $145+ for it?I just feel like: am I dealing with a real American company and doing business in USA?"

I didn't get any contact regarding a delivery schedule. The status of the order is \"Pick Up\" and according to the tracking website:Pick UpItem is out for delivery or arrived at local facility, you may schedule for delivery or pickup. Please be aware of the collection deadline.General explanation:1. Your package has arrived at a local delivery point.2. Your package is out for delivery.If you ensure your package has been delivered successfully, please ignore this notice. However, if you haven't received your package, we'd advise you to contact the carrier to arrange a re-delivery or collect your item. Hint: Generally, the carrier has collection deadline, we'd advise you pickup your package at once, or it might be returned to the sender.Since the last update location is \u5e7f\u5143\u5e02. I google it and it shows Guangyuan in China. My delivery address IS NOT in China.2022-02-28: I contact support again provide the screenshot from the tracking website and what \"PICK UP\" on the tracking website mean.2022-03-04: They responded saying the package has been picked up from the local post office and ask me to follow the tracking website. It's 2022-03-08. I haven't heard from the support team. Are they looking into it? are they checking with the delivery team? will I hear back about my purchase. Not a clue.EDIT: VR WAVE team respond to this review that they've sent me an email but I cannot reply to them below. I haven't received any email 20 min after their Trustpilot response (not in SPAM box either). Hopefully, it's just an email delivery delayed.EDIT:  VR WAVE team responded to this review and told me to check my email that I never get. I contacted them on their website LIVE CHAT on 2022-03-09. They said they're sorry and they will get back to me in the next 24-48 hours. It's 2022-03-11 today and I never get my update.EDIT: They emailed me later on 2022-03-11 and providing an invalid phone number that can be found on a tracking website through a google search. However, the information is not valid on that tracking site.EDIT: 2022-03-14 a local delivery agent contact me. He's not from the post office that VR WAVE support team tell me to contact with the incomplete phone number. I told them the phone number is INVALID and they still insist that I contact the number. I'm a local, I know the phone number is missing a digit! In case you wonder, I did call the number and get the exact response that I expected, the call doesn't even go through.The lenses work great (I added an other for that). It helps with the blurriness on my QUEST 2. If you're located at a place with good delivery, maybe it works for you. But it seems so far it hasn't been the best experience for me. My experience with VR WAVE support has been frustrating and unhelpful. Here's how VR WAVE team could do better:1. Provide enough information regarding delivery   - If it's delivered to the local post office, I'd expected to get an update on how I can picked up my product. If not that, then the information regarding how my product will be delivered to me with an expected date. The tracking site is not helpful.2. Provide a better support experience:    - Listen to the customer.    - Research and contact relevant stakeholder to solve the problem.      - Provide reliable relevant information to solve the problem.             - \"Follow the tracking website\" is NOT helpful when the customer show that it's not accurate            - \"Please contact this post office with xxxxxx\" is not helpful when the customer already mentioned that it's an invalid number"

I ordered another pair, hoping they had fixed this issue, though it remained. I wrote the company three times requesting advice and they did not respond, which is inexcusable.EDIT: VR WAVE responded to above review stating that they had not received my emails, which were sent to the correct address and were not returned.

I asked if they would sell one to me or exchange mine.  They wanted me to send them a photo of the broken case which I thought was ridiculous for such a low cost item.  I sent the photo and that was the last I heard from.  Honestly the only reason I care about the case is because I share my VR with others need a place to store the lenses.

          "Contenu": "I chose VR Wave because I share the Rift S with my husband and daughter, and I really loved the concept of the magnetic lenses. The prescription is perfect and they are easy to put in and take out, but otherwise I was a little disappointed in the quality. These were more expensive than other VR lens options, but the magnets are so small and weak (one of them even popped out when I first took them out of the box) that the lenses shift very easily while playing and it causes uncomfortable distortions. The placement of the magnets cause the shape of the lenses to sit uncomfortably on the bridge of the nose.Overall these are a really great concept but they need some improvements. Personally I would love if the lenses had larger, stronger magnets so that they fit in more securely, and that the magnet placement took advantage of the extra space above and to the side of where the lenses for, rather than in the middle where it presses on the nose."

          "Contenu": "The frames that hold the VR-Wave lenses press against my nose and are very uncomfortable.  I'm an adult male with an average size nose, I guess--nobody's ever told me I had a big nose.  But these things stick out and around the Oculus lenses (screens).  I have somewhat narrow-set eyes so I use the middle position for the screens.  If I set them to the widest position they barely touch my nose--but then the interpupillary distance is wrong and the screens are not in sharp focus.  Given those issues I'm not entirely sure my next comments are valid--but the lenses don't give me a very good view in VR.  I can only get a sharp focus in the very center of the screen; if I move my eyes up or to the sides it's not very sharp.  I suspect my complicated prescription has something to do with it, along with my astigmatism.  Customer service is outstanding.  I asked for a refund and had no problems getting my money back.  These lenses are a great idea and I hope they can fix the things that gave me problems, because I\u2019d sure like to have them."

This is at a time where China was hit hard with COVID Omicron variant. So if it safes lives im happy to wait. The reason for my avg review based on the communication of customer service. 1) if a situation like this arise simply inform customers. That shipping will be delayed2) When I first ask about my order. I got an answer, they they will look into it. I never got a follow up mail.3) I followed up myself (after a automated mail ask me to review my not received product) and then Customer service offered me a refund or send a new product.\ud83d\udc4dThis is actually a good thing. In the end the package arrived. I guess that also there customer support has a tight control what every emp. is allowed to say. So its probably not even on a specific stuff member. I conclusion be more proactive in your communication. I understand that there could be a worry of mass cancellations if you tell people that there deliver takes up to 2 month. But right now you make it very hard to recommend me to friends, so it will hurt in the long run."

They fit too thickly on the Quest 2's lenses, so they bulge out. Resting my headset on my face, these inserts dig into my nose. In addtion, my FOV is horribly altered in that not only can I see the bezel of the lenses, the edges of the lense inserts give off a very jarring fisheye effect when looking anywhere near the edge of the lenses -- a nonexistent issue when simply using my glasses. To top it all off, my vision is blurred when wearing these lesnses, depsite them being given the correct prescription in addition to my extra care to clean the lenses. One month waiting for shipping and $100 down the gutter!Update: While I still cannot recommend these lenses to anyone with a large prescription, I have to give credit where its due. VR WAVE read my concerns and actually offered a refund for my order. I have to recognize their customer service here and solely for their customer service excellence, I'll be changing my review from 1 star to 3 stars."

Even with this little out of focus issue, I will be ordering another set for my Q3 soon. The three were ordered with my new prescription from my eye doctor, but not what I use everyday.  So possible it is the prescription and not lenses.  I plan to try and order lenses that are previous prescription and see if any difference.  Was told by eye doctor that I had to use most current prescription even though I did not upgrade my everyday lenses to that prescription and stayed with my previous lenses.  Only minor changes, but I feel those lenses work well with vr.  Sorry, If I am not explaining this very well.  More then willing to try and answer any questions you might have on this issue."

I don't even know if the first 2 orders belong to some other people or not.After posting the first Review, Manager of VR Wave Joy reached out to me, to help me get my right order.In the end, they were really helpful, and I hope that my problem was just a special case, and that the customer support at VR Wave are actually helping other people with their issues.Product 5/5\u2605Customer Support 3.5/5\u2605"

          "Titre": "Bad quality. Lenses fall off and arrived with tiny dents.",
          "Contenu": "1. These lenses do work correctly as per prescription. But that is the only 'positive'. 2. They barely hold onto my HP Reverb G2. The right one stays there pretty well but the left one does not stay on and simply falls off when used while playing. No matter how many times I tried to fit it back on, it keeps falling off anyway. Those frames are soft silicone and it is simply too loose to stay on the left G2 lens.3. I ordered 'anti-glare coating' addon for these lens and when I got them I could see tiny dents on the surface of the lenses straight of out the box. Not sure if it is coating damage or lens damage but both inserts have few of these tiny dents here and there. They do not affect the way I see through the lens though, or at least I can't notice it when close to my eye, but still how come the new product has these issues? 4. VR Wave Support initially responded to my request about left insert falling off by providing a link to installation video. After few attempts I thought the insert is finally in place as I twisted it sideways but it fell off on my eye later again while playing a game. I tried to reach out for help again, even recorded a video of a problem, but no response so far.You can watch my video demonstrating the issue if you search for 'VR Wave left lens falls off' on youtubeOverall I spent almost $100 following the hype and promos from Youtubers but only got a damaged product that can't be used. I either need this solved/replaced or refunded please. I will update this review if I get any response and solution from them.UPDATE:VR Wave team contacted me and offered a replacement for a lens that was falling off. I finally received it. They didn't just send me a rim, but they included a new lens with it as well. And now fits very tight, staying in place as it should. In fact it's more secure now than the right one. Though right one does stay in place, it's more \"loose\" in a way that I don't need to apply much force to pop it off. While this new left one replacement sits there really nicely. If anything, VR Wave should only use the inserts like that for all of their lenses. I can finally use the product now hence changing the rating considering they were able to help me."

Putting the lenses in and out is no longer a problem since they're magnetic.The adapters are sturdy, good quality, they come with 2 spares in case one breaks, the lens are good quality and they come in a very nice package too. For anyone needing glasses this is a million times better, a total must-have for VR.The service was very fast, I got them in less than two weeks (Spain) and the price was also very good even with a strong prescription like mine.Very recommended.

I mainly use Q2 for Eleven Table Tennis, a wonderful simulator that is a main source of exercise when i can\u2019t get on a tennis court. I also use a BOBO fan to prevent fogging, and I had a VR Wave cover (pads) that Oculus sent me. The combination of all of this makes VR a delight."

          "Contenu": "First off, the VR WAVE Rx Lenses are WONDERFUL! I no longer have to wear my \"Readers\", which were previously needed to get a clear and focused image, regardless of the IPD Setting. Comfort is much improved, internal reflections are gone plus, since I no longer have to clean the lenses on the \"Readers\" prior to use, my OG QUEST ONE is now grab 'n go. Huge improvement in user-ergonomics! So why the 4-Star Rating? The Installation Video depicts installation ONLY on the QUEST TWO, which is designed/built differently than the OG QUEST ONE. It took a bit of fiddling to discover there are bezels surrounding the installed lenses on the OG QUEST ONE which need to be gently pried-off BEFORE installing the magnetic bases on the VR WAVE lenses. Once removed, the rest of the installation went swimmingly. Please include this information either in the shipped package or update your Installation Video. Otherwise, a VERY HAPPY customer. Thanx and Cheers!"

          "Contenu": "I left a bad review about how much the magnets annoyed me for the Quest 2 lenses, but I finally, after having them for like half a year, figured out how to attach them so the lenses are unlikely to slip or fall off. You have to put them on with both parts stuck together and be careful not to push the bottom part too far.So I'm upgrading my review to 4 stars. Still, I don't see any benefit to having the magnetic attachments. I still think it would be better if they just snapped on like the Valve Index ones. As long as they stay on, you shouldn't have any reason to need to clean inside them, but if you do, the Index ones come off easily enough. So minus one star for that annoying and pointless design choice.These lenses are an absolutely essential accessory for any HMD if you need glasses though. Even though I could use the Quest 2 with glasses (never got them to fit with the Index), I would never want to go back. I buy a pair for every HMD I get, which is 2 so far, and am holding off on getting a Reverb until the lenses go on sale again, because what's the point of having better resolution if you can't see it clearly?"

I have contacted support to no avail, as of yet. They keep sending me links to the instructional video, which is no help.I will only change my review if and when they help me, or send a refund.The lens do look nice, and the RX was spot on. I hope they do something...so please buyer beware, if you have an older Rift (CV1) they will not fit as the cloth in the faceplate does not allow the removal of the bands around the lens in the headset. I am not going to damage or modify my expensive headset, spent 140.00 with shipping and the addon anti-glare and blue light filters. Very unhappy right now.***EDIT***they contacted me back, and informed me there was a typo on the website, and sent me a refund and coupon code, I hope to see that they will have something available in future, I appreciate that, other than that I still recommend them, the lens were of great quality, and I still would recommend them********"

          "Contenu": "Ordered a set during Black Friday.  Got an email back for optical prescription confirmation which I've found very professional since I didn't upload a doctor's prescription.  So far so good... About 20 days later I received the Quest 2 glasses by Canada Post but they made a mistake and messed up the right eye which was confirmed by the plastic prescription card they include with the unit.  I was mad but wrote an email and got a response 2 days later saying they will correct their mistake and send another right eye.  Got a DHL shipping notification from China for it so I was pleased to see that at least they reacted rapidly.  3 days later, I get a 23$ customs bill from DHL... Now I was really mad, wrote another email suggesting I refuse the package and they ship it another way or that they reimburse the 23$ I have to pay.  Got no reply and DHL was saying that the parcel would be delayed so I ended up paying for VR-WAVE's mistake.  Didn't try the glasses on yet...!UPDATE 20211225 The customs invoice was already included in the email I sent. VR-WAVE contacted me a few days ago and offered to pay for half of their mistake which I refused.  In the meantime, the remade lense arrived and this time it was done correctly according to the submitted optical prescription.   The lense is perfect so I added 1 star.  Waiting for a return from VR-WAVE since they said that they will contact their management.UPDATE 20211227 I got a notification for a partial refund technically they refunded me a little more than I asked.  I asked for the additional customs cost of 23$CAN and I received 23$US but it was possibly a mistake!  Upgraded to 4 stars because the product is good but should have been 3.5 because of the hassle."

Near or far, they help and don't break the bank. Full review follows...I have the Quest 2 and cannot see far away too clearly, not bad but, I saw these recommended and for the very affordable price, I thought I'd try them. My wife cannot see close up so, we needed to get a pair for her. Both pairs work very well, just as you would expect. They clear up the view for both of us, near or far. The spacer for eye-glasses on the Quest 2 works but, this is sooo much more comfortable.There is a one star removal in my rating (I added one back too though, I'll explain in a moment) because the instructions are not terribly clear. Thankfully, you can look up installation vids online but it still took me two or three tries to get mine on. Once I got the hang of it though, I popped my wife's on with no problem. Just be careful pressing them on. No, you won't ruin your headset, unless you're a ham-handed oaf about it.  As far as clearing up non-vision-related VR blurring & trails, they don't help that. I read reviews that said they help, they don't. But, the product manufacturer never claims they do that anyway.All in all, both pairs were extremely affordable and worth every penny. They came packaged nicely and were in a protective container. The company also sent out a direct email asking about my experience and asking for a Trustpilot review, whether my experience was good or bad, so they'd know how they're doing. That's top-notch, shows they care how they are doing, and I added one star back for that. They also did *not* harass me with spam after my purchase. Just a quick \"How'd we do?\" and that was it. Great job."

I am extremely happy that there is no vertical or horizontal distortion in the VR wave lenses I got, with a small amount of distortion around the outer ring.  I notice it most in Elite Dangerous where there are linear interfaces in my ship that change angle right at the edge of the lens, but this is fine!

However after i guess waiting 8days from order my lenses were marked as dispatched and i was sent a Fedex tracking number by sms. The lenses left on the thursday from China and arrived with me in the UK Monday, i would say that's pretty quick. I ordered lenses for the DJI FPV V2 Headset, the lenses clip on perfectly and now allow me to see perfectly ok without my poxy glasses. Really happy is an understatement. Absolutely do recommend these people, see my other reviews i am genuine and not easily please at all!!"

The glasses that I have to wear every day have progressive lenses which make it difficult when it comes to reading things in VR apps and games.I was really impressed though after receiving the lenses. VR focal length does not work quite the same as day-to-day wearing for reading and distance. But after using the lenses I can see a significant difference in clarity when it comes to reading and overall field of view. I also like the fact that the lenses are magnetized so that when I'm with friends it is quick to switch them in and out for others."

Vision in PSR2 is now great and I can finally say goodbye to wearing glasses when I play the likes of GT7, RE8 and Horizon: Call of the mountain.I highly recommend lenses from VR Wave and believe they are absolutely worth the price.My only minor complaint is, that the included QR code was not linked to an PSVR2 installation guide video. Instead I was sent to a page that listed installation guides to all kind of head sets, just no PSVR2 video. But that is really only a minor complaint in an overall great experience with buying these lenses from VR Wave."

When I put the lenses on the bases, they seemed quite wobbly as if the magnets weren't strong enough. However, once I wore the Quest 2, it was wonderful, so much more clarity than my last lenses (not VRWave), and more viewable area. They do stick out quite a bit, and I can feel them touching my nose, but it isn't uncomfortable. This also means that there is less light leakage around the nose area! There was no slippage or movement from the lenses whilst wearing the headset. They can however be knocked off quite easily when the headset is off. Some kind of lens protection/cover would have been a nice addition. Overall, I would recomment them, they're worth the money despite the little problems (difficulty in fitting, wobbly when not being worn)."

The lenses came in a plain brown box but inside was a nice little holder for the lenses along with a cleaning kit and some type of blue light and filter paper to show you the blue light being filtered if you ordered your prescription with the blue light filter. Lenses even came with an extra set of magnets ( which is what holds the lenses to the headset) which is nice is you treat your stuff like a child. I don't see an adult having to replace or change out the magnets if they remove the lenses carefully when they need a cleaning. Customer service response is quick. I had a question about my order and they reached out to me in 24 hours. The only thing that might remove a star for me would be the shipping/ tracking service used. My tracking number made it appear as if my order was arriving via USPS sooner than expected but then never showed up making me believe that my order had been lost or never shipped. VR Wave responded quickly and solved my issue promptly. If you order from them, exercise patience. From the time I placed my order to the time I received it, it took a month, but it was way worth the wait!! I  highly recommend them if you use glasses and want to  experience VR without them getting in your way. It will definitely make you appreciate and enjoy VR the way it was meant to be watched. Thank you VR Wave!!"

I have purchased every possible upgrade to make the experience in VR more comfortable while working out and still had issues with the mask applying uncomfortable pressure on my glasses and with the lenses steaming up and slipping during active play.  These VR Wave lenses have totally changed my experience in VR.  I can see everything in VR totally clearly without the discomfort of my glasses digging into my face and without all the slipping.  The cost was more than reasonable, they arrived so fast and shipped VERY securely.  Installing the lenses into my headset was simple and they fit very securely.  I can't recommend them any more highly, if you wear glasses and spend any time in VR these are a must have."

I have around -9 on both of my eyes and no problemo. There is only one thing I could say is a bit minus and it's that You can feel the borders of the lenses a bit on Your nose (not painfull or anything but You can still feel them), but if You for some reason hate the touch feeling, just use glass-spacer. Oh and shipping was super fast, even faster than estimated (I live in mid EU)."

Now that I have the new lenses, I can play as long as I want with clearer vision than I had with either glasses or contacts. I purchased them for my daughter as well and we very easily switch out our lenses.  My daughters RX is rather high with astigmatisms in both eyes and she said she sees perfect with them.

I was thoroughly impressed by their customer service and their concern for customer satisfaction. The new lenses arrived and I was able to easily make the swap.

This certainly put my mind at ease. Shipping was relatively quick considering it was a custom item. All together my order came out to around $120 with shipping. I feel this is fair since these are actual prescription lenses signed off by an actual optician. The quality is fantastic! I was able to install these quickly. (Just remember, magnet side goes up.) The magnets hold very well. They will not fall off accidentally, but remove easily without tools if desired. I simply leave them on all the time. I\u2019m very happy with this purchase and I highly recommend VR-Wave lenses for anyone who wears glasses and uses VR. I was not paid to write this, I just really love VR Wave!"

I was initially concerned because the order form seemed to be less refined than I suppose I expected. My wife's prescription was very easy to enter. My prescription had both a near sighted and a far sighted lense, an unusual state that the order form even asked you to confirm.

Without a doubt, I would recommend this company to anyone who needs vision correction and wants to try to make their Meta Quest 2 more enjoyable."

However, I had made a mistake transcribing my prescription numbers, and VR Wave contacted me to query the numbers I had submitted. I then corrected my error and the lenses arrived pretty quickly thereafter.VR-Wave's attention to detail in checking the prescription was very impressive in an age of on-line order processing where the buyer has to live with their mistakes. That attention reassured me about the rest of the production process, and I was not disappointed.Installing the lenses was easily achived and they transform the VR experience for me. I use VR in Flight Simulator and the ability to read small digits on radios in the VR cockpit and still look outside at the scenery is transformative."
