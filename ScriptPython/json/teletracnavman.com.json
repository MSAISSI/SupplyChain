Teletrac were unable to help as the person who was dealing with it was not in the office! we have been withourt a vehicle for a week and still no sign of a resolution. Don't use Teletrac!"

Those are just a few of the many problems that I've had. The customer service has been fairly helpful, but their response times are hit or miss. When our contract runs out I will not be renewing with Teletrac."

At first everyone we spoke with was nice but as time went along and we started calling in with the issues we were having, no one ever returned our calls. In the last 6 months we tried emailing and calling both to get an address to return the unused boxes and have had no reply.  We even told them we were going to stop paying for the contract and still no reply.  These eld boxes are a joke.  They do not work as far as tracking you and the locator was never correct. Also, they sold me these on the pretext that there was IFTA reporting capabilities and then tried to tell me that was only if i input all mileage manually. We had a driver get an HOS violation due to the eld - we are still not sure why because he had done everything exactly as he should have."

Just went through an IFTA audit and almost every month there is a problem with miles tracking and or start and finish mileage is not adding correctly! All im told is we have to escalate your issue. I email them daily telling them my equipment doesnt work, their plug and play units to 4G do not work with my PTO's or Cameras and they want me to pay to upgrade and install all new equipment. I have never seen such a useless management team. Now when I call customer service to check to see if they have any new information for me I'm told I need to talk to technical support when I'm transferred to technical support they tell me it's a customer service issue then transfer me back to customer support. Then I'm told they will have to escalate this. I tried cancelling but they want me to buy out the rest of my contract for thousands. I resigned a contract 24 months ago and my equipment has never worked correctly since day one! STAY AWAY!"

I have had mine replaced multiple times and they are continually giving me false alarms. You can not speak to someone in customer service, they only give an email and then never respond to requests. There seems to be no complaint process. When you do speak to a service rep they are very unhelpful and argumentative. When I requested new tags I received the instruction in bold to return the faulty tags or you will be charged which sums up the view of the customer with this company! What about if you get zero customer support and your technology never works properly we will be happy to compensate you and have that in bold! The problem I feel is because of the deal this company has done with BMW etc. you have their technology when you buy the car and it\u2019s not easy to change. This creates complacency within the company and no desire to improve. Certainly when I buy a new car in the future I will check if this technology is installed and this will heavily influence my decision to purchase the car or not."

We were never notified that service would not be ending but we were continually charged the monthly service. We contacted them in July when we noticed that it was not tracking our vehicles. We were then told we would have to upgrade to the new version 4G units so the systems would work. if we agreed to pay for the units and signed a new contract we would be credited for the past charges going back to February 2022.  We agreed and waited for an email  with a new contract. We never recieved an email but were charged the following month for service and we have been charged every month since. We have contacted them every month and have been told a different story each time. We reached out again today 1/24/2023 to try and get credited and new units. We are giving up and going to our credit card company in hopes of having the charges credited. If you are thinking of tracking for your fleet vehicles.

          "Contenu": "What a disappointment.  We have had Teletrac in three of our work trucks for several years.  We lost communication with our vehicles on 6/7/22. We needed to add a new work truck to our account as well, so I called. There was a migration from 3G to 4G that required new equipment in our existing vehicles, that's why no service.  To add the new truck there was no charge for equipment and a 3 year contract.  We paid $139 per vehicle for the 4G upgrade with no contact extension on the existing vehicles.  We received plug and play equipment that we had to SELF INSTALL.  Seems that this isn't the best equipment for tampering, but the self install is above my pay grade.  I was told I could pay $179 per vehicle and wait 2-3 months to have the upgrade installed.  I asked how could it be that I could order equipment for our new vehicle at no charge and only pay the monthly fee for software reporting and have it installed in 8 calendar days - and yet it would be $318 per vehicle for equipment and installation done within 2 months for vehicles that we have been paying the monthly fee for, for years.  I was met with a canned response that the company \"tried to do it the best way they could\".  No concern that we have been customers for years.  I was given the email address to write my cancellation to and told that I may still owe for the contracts that were never extended.  No regard for our business, no desire to retain us as customers."

We use thousands of GPS units, but needed to demo and review their product further because of discrepancies in what different sales reps said their product could do.  Other companies provide a demo, and we've found that there are several companies whose tech actually works."

This is a very important part of the service, as how else are you going to know your vehicle has been stolen? Otherwise you are going to have to wait until you get home to find it gone. And that could be way too late! Our subscription just came up for renewal (\u00a3168 for 12 months!). Despite the tracker not working as it should, no discount was offered nor any solid idea of when it would start to work properly again. Customer services is awful. AVOID AVOID AVOID."

Please be Advised, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THEM!!!!  As for a previous review, they will not allow you to get out of contracts, even if the unit has been involved in an accident, totaled, and is not being replaced.  So now we are paying for service that we cannot use.  And somehow they think I will be a customer following the 3 years... NOT!"

Resolving issues takes way too long. There are many many great people at Teletrac that I feel are victims of circumstances. They had no part in building the software or hardware but continually have to deal with unhappy customers trying to solve problem that won't seem to go away. One scary issue is the Promiles for IFTA taxes, the Promiles platform seems to be solid but the information downloading into it from Teletrac has some serious issues."

The maps are also outdated on the system & often show you driving through fields or roads that don't exist. My drivers are constantly complaining about how bad the systems are to navigate you anywhere.I sent in a complaint asking for someone to contact me regarding my problems, and received an email back saying my account manager would contact me.... he never did.Now I have received another email saying my complaint is now resolved & closed!!!All I now what to know is how I can get out of this contract, so that we can move to a different company?"

After many years with this company, you have to see each driver logs to see if the driver used Personal Conveyance or Adverse driver condition in the wrong way to drive more, there's no way to see it in a report of any kind. No automatic yard move, like Onmitrac that have a geofence on your yard and all movement at your yard never trigger a driving status nor unassigned drive time. If the system gets jammed sometimes don't even report logs of any kind during the malfunction allowing the driver to drive more, very bad for safety.Tier one of Support, half of them will never see a Violation if is not showed as a Violation on their screen, no knowledge of HOS rules at all, great customer service but undertrained. I can remember many awesome guys in Tier 1, but they always have to make you wait until they ask your question to the Tier2. Tier 2 is very hard to find."

I call up to arrange an engineer visit and am told that as the unit it over a year old I have to pay to fix their faulty equipment!?!I did not choose the equipment (and we haven't damaged it either) they supplied to provide the service I pay a monthly fee for and judging by the 33% failure rate I have experienced over the last 18 months these trackers were chosen on a cost rather than a reliability basis. I really cannot fathom the short sighted policy of a service company that expects their monthly paying customers to pay for the repair of equipment essential to the supply of their service. You would think a professional customer focused company would factor in any potential breakdown costs into their monthly service charge, but guess not.Customer service isn't bad its just really short staffed (I think another poorly thought out money saving measure)  and waiting 2-3 days for a reply to an email or a request to be actioned is not unusual."

He just forwards my complaints to tech support who don't ever seem to get them fixed. I had 2 other bad reviews on her but navman got them removed as they don't want to fix the issues but they don't want anyone to know about it either. I am fighting the removal of the other 2 reviews. They asked for my account number which you put in the form at the bottom of the page. Their excuse for removal was they didn't know the account number. LOOK AT THE BOTTOM OF THE FORM NAVMAN. IT IS THERE ON EVERY REVIEW I WRITE FOR YOU TO SEE. I speak with your tech support line on a daily basis and they have no issue finding my phone number to return calls later in the day so if you are truly interested in contacting me please refer to my account number and dial the phone number listed for me. thanks.Update:My fixer Jeff finally got deeper involved. He totally agreed with me that my experience here is not acceptable. He did get tier 2 management involved and they have so far sent 2 of the 4 parts needed to fix my trucks. Still waiting on the other to to be sent. Nothing has arrived but I can see the shipping info on the first 2. Jeff is recommending that tier 2 be required to contact the customer before sidelining a suggested repair from tier 1 tech support. As it stands now tier 2 doesn't agree with the diagnosis they just cancel the case. This is where most of the problems of long delay occur."

Repetitive back and fourth emails waiting for replies, useless staff,  receiving \u201cif you don\u2019t reply in 3 days we will cancel your ticket \u201c when I was still waiting for a reply.... The first man I spoke to was no help at all, he  told me we couldn\u2019t pause/ stop the tracker ( which 5 months later I found out I could )he informed me that we were on one year contract that I believed to nearly be up for renewal....   he never got back to me and I again had to contact teletrac and open another ticket! The second man was no help again.I got no where and was still paying for a van that was off the road. I believe we have payed for 6 months worth of tracker that was sitting in an unused van ? I gave up with him in the end :( I then spoke to a woman who was much more helpful, however we didn\u2019t get anywhere. I explained what had happen to which she apologised, and managed to cancel the tracker for us FINALY !!!! I also asked her to cancel another tracker, which she did!             ( these are for 90 day rolling trackers ) I then asked to see the original contract as I had just about had enough of the company and wanted to leave ASAP ! I found out that we were In a 5 year contract ?!?!? SERIOUSLY!!! I received the contract and it was signed in 2017... which meant one more year, I was so relieved! I was then told this was a MISTAKE ?!?! and they had made an error on the contract  ?!? They gave me a price to cancel the tracker with a \u00a320 discount .... I just left the email conversation as I had had enough. I canceled our direct debit and emailed no more. For a company that we have been with since 2014 I am shocked at the service and lack of help! I would have thought with the times wasted  we have encountered, they would have honoured the cancelation of contract and apologised profusely! I am genuinely disgusted and wait to hear from them when they don\u2019t receive their payment ( for unused trackers ) I am truly saddened that a world wide company only care about money and not their customers- especially loyal ones."

I had to press them to update our entire fleet's software. Why is that? Shouldn't software be updated automatically if needed? Or if they see that 4 trucks aren't working properly shouldn't they opt to update the whole fleet? Very annoying and lacking in customer service. One tech named Mario actually called me back and helped with my issue to that is why there is even 3 stars here."

What if the ELD law was in effect? My trucks would have been down this whole time? What if your phone would brake and 6 weeks later your carrier wouldn't be able to provide you with a replacement? Update:I managed to reach several people in managerial position. It look like they solve this problem in a matter of a day. In all honesty, all the people in this company I spoke with striked me as good, intelligent and caring about their brand. I don't know where was the break in communication, and I believe it is not acceptable. I also know most people are only taking the time to write review when they are upset and not when all is going smoothly. I hope this will get better."

You would think that the technical team would know this.  Instead, I would get an email from the technical team once in a while telling me that they were \"still working on it but had no resolution.\"  Frustrated with the poor service and needing a better system I shopped around.NOTE : After the initial 3 year contract Teletrac renews!  You need to be careful to cancel before that happens.  Not what the sales person told me but hey it's in the small print, right!  I attempted to cancel my account before the actual renewal date (not within their time though) because there are cheaper, friendlier programs out there, that are much easier to use with exceedingly better service.  The would not cancel my account since I had not contacted them 90 days prior.  Sent 4 emails and left messages with several different people early in January.  It took them more than a week to return my emails and calls.  If you are a small business like me, do not hire these people   They are only interested in your money, not in providing you with good service.  I will wait until my term expires and cancel.  Don't get caught like I did!Update 04/14/17:After this review, they did cancel my account yay!  I have been pleased with the service I got from their retention department.  So for that reason I'm changing my 2 star rating to 3."

          "Contenu": "We had three tablets installed on 9/3/2015. On 9/15/16 I sent an email to Norman informing him the system does NOT perform as promised. The \u201csalesman\u201d was well aware of the prior system we had been using (Nextraq) and he stated TeleTrac would do the same thing for less money each month. The TeleTrac system does NOT provide the same service. Norman replied saying he would send this matter to the \u201cimplementation team\u201d.  I called Norman numerous times thereafter to ask about the software being adapted so the system would perform as promised by TeleTrac\u2019s agent.  I finally received a telephone call the beginning of 2016 from the software development department informing me they could not write a program that would fulfill my needs as set forth in my 9/15/15 email to Norman \u2013 they breached of the lease. On 11/20/15 I sent an email stating two of the tablets had quit working. I received an email 11/23/15 stating the firmware would be updated. This did not work so new tablets were sent out and received on 12/3/15. On 12/4/15 I sent an email informing TeleTrac that the tablets still did not work and requested the contract be canceled due to non-performance and a credit for the months we hadn\u2019t been able to use the system but had paid anyway.  Jan agreed to credit our account which was never done. On 12/9/15 we received replacement chargers but these didn\u2019t work either.  I sent another email on 12/17/15 once again asking for a credit as that was never done.  Finally, on 2/12/16 I sent another email saying the one tablet was once again not working (the other one never worked). My small, family owned plumbing company has paid a total of $698.05 for one tablet that worked for maybe four months (the other tablet NEVER worked) with no credit given.  TeleTrac\u2019s Subscriber Agreement sets forth we are being charged for use of their \u201cdata, software and added value options\u201d. We have NOT used any of TeleTrac\u2019s software since February 2016 and we will not pay for something we are not and cannot use.  I believe the $698.05 is overpayment for a system that didn\u2019t work and the software was misrepresented to me as it did not fulfill our needs. Now Teletrac is threatening to sue my business (I'm a woman) that I own with my son for $3,000.00!!UPDATE: This review prompted Teletrac Navman to contact me. They zeroed out our account and even refunded the company all of the money we had been charged. He explained they had hired new management to work out the issues with the hardware and system and apologized for everything we had gone through."

We've had a few issues, that needed to be handled.  The reason I'm giving 4 stars is that we like the product, however the customer service started out very rough.  Very long wait times.  That has improved, however, when call backs are promised they don't usually happen and I end up having to call them back.  I don't know where the ball gets dropped, but it does.  We do have trouble with the unit going OFFLINE.  Sometimes getting it back ONLINE takes a few tries and then wait time for all of the information, that has been stored, to be uploaded.  There are times we have to wait til next day to make sure the system has updated.  It doesn't happen often enough to warrant looking for another company.  All things considered, we will still stay with Teletrac."

And that was after being on hold for over an hour. Well, today, thinking I might have the same issue I was first surprised that the call was answered quickly, and I got Axl. I remember his voice from a few times I have talked with him before, a few months back. Well, he not only helped me, helped me understand what I am seeing, helpled me correct the issue and he followed up twice. Just to make sure I was good. This is not only the first time he has helped me completely. If I could have one tech assigned to me, I would request Axl. Thank you, Axl, for all of your help every time I got to talk to you."
