Migration was problematic as their support team changed the effective domain name during restoration meaning a load of internal links broke and their support staff could only offer to restore again which would have meant us losing sales that had happened since.Then the website even with a turbo subscription was slow and sluggish. Their CDN also means that changes propagate slowly and inconsistently so you make a change and it seems to take ages, or deleting media shows the media deleted then it re-appears.In the end we lost all confidence in EasyWP and migrated back to our old server, since then visits to our website have increased and we can work on updates more confidently."

I asked their support and they told that it's only available for the domains on Namecheap(Their parent company)!!! I must buy a domain from them or migrate my domain to namecheap to use free SSL!After talking for a while the other option was to move my DNS from Cloudflare to ... you named it Namecheap! What I needed was hosting with SSL but they were forcing me to move my Domain or DNS to Namecheap."

Frustrating doesn't begin to cover it.Firstly, I'll say I've got websites hosted with multiple companies for various set ups. I wanted one domain, one wordpress install on a wordpress specialist host. As much to test the service as anything.The set up was really easy. The performance seemed impressive too.But that's where it ends.I'd say, if your domain name is already with namecheap, you'd probably be fine. But if it's not? Look out!The sheer rigmarole of trying to get a straight answer on how to set up to make my domain work with their hosting was laughably bad.Each support request just redirected me to knowledgebase articles that had already been read, tried and shown to not have worked. I got the feeling that the support only knows how to send links out, rather than actually provide advice from a position of hosting knowledge.To cap it off - because I REALLY tried and I REALLY wanted to exhaust all options before cancelling a service less than 24 hours after paying for it; my very final support request was met with an attempt to just upsell. Pure nonsense. Purchased it. Tried it. Couldn't get it to work. Simply would not recommend based on the amount of time spent getting absolutely nowhere with support, which bodes very poorly were I to have stayed."

Also they do try to add services, and the price keeps changing. I have gotten 2 price change notices in 2 weeks. I seem to get 1 or 2 emails a day about it. If I ever get it all cancelled I would not sign up again for those reasons. I HATE being pushed around when I want something or to cancel something."

Then my website was suddenly discontinued; the support specialist told me my subscription was cancelled due to non-payment and the site deleted.However, they then found out that I've actually paid for an annual subscription and the information about non-payment was wrong.So they managed to quickly restore the website from the backup. But all my development efforts were lost, as the website returned to its default condition.I told that to the support specialist, and they restored the website's design, layout, content and plugins to its previous state.In the end, I think the support service works great, and I'm grateful to the support guys for resolving my issue quickly.On the maintenance part, however, there was some serious oversight which led to the unrightful deletion of my website."

          "Contenu": "EasyWP is the best option for beginners who understand how to optimize WordPress themes, media files, and code structure to achieve super-fast website loading.Currently, I have nearly 7,000 pages of information, and each page contains an image or poster, totaling almost 4GB of data. It's working well for me as I've just started a new project. It's an affordable way to begin something new. I anticipate upgrading to the Supersonic option as the number of users grows to enhance their experience.If anyone encounters slow loading times or other issues, it largely depends on how well our theme is coded and developed, as well as how we optimize each article's images before posting. It's essential to use fewer plugins when they're not necessary. By following these practices, EasyWP becomes the best choice.I understand that website optimization, caching methods, and using a CDN (Content Delivery Network) to reduce server requests are crucial. If you're familiar with these three to five simple concepts, then EasyWP, particularly the Turbo and Supersonic options, is the best choice.Let me provide you with more insight based on my experience of almost a month. It's perfectly well-coded on the backend with the latest hardware, especially CPUs and RAM. This made me choose it because many less famous companies use second-hand hardware, which doesn't lead to a robust server response.This review you can read before purchasing and In future if I get such error and things what i read already __ I will be welcome back here to give another short in details..."
