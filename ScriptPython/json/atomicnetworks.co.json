I was stuck for almost 72 hours beacause i was short of 3 cents(probably the crypto transfer fees).although it was partly my fault i recieved no help/explanation the least thing they could do was help me find the reason and invoice me again and then we could figure out something about the underpaid invoice."

          "Titre": "3, out of 5, for neither positive, nor negative. Neutral. Asked by them to leave a review.",
          "Contenu": "3 out of 5 stars because I could not see another way for a grade of neutral. I mean, I do not want to discourage the reader from becoming a customer. Nor do I want to encourage him. Plain point of no opinion about it. I never was a customer. As of this writing, it looks like I will not be one in the near future. This review is written because I was asked to write it in their reply. Which could be a standard automatic signature for the email address who sent me their reply. I was not promised any gain out of writing it. I will try to describe only facts, and all of them. It is written out of memory. I hope I will not be wrong with the details.  I was considering their cheapest, USD 6.50 VPS black-friday-2023 plan for a single VPS. USD 6.50 per year, paid in advance. Link for the exact offer removed because Trustpilot disallow it. I did not look for anything else. I emailed contact@, which is the only email address I could see at their site, with pre purchase questions. 24 hours passed without receiving a reply. So I tried to open a ticket as a guest, repeating my previous pre purchase questions, along with more questions. The message confirming the ticket submission stated I will receive a confirmation email. Which I have not received. After about 1 hour, I tried to submit another ticket as a guest. This ticket shortly mentioned my previous ticket and email, and also wondered if they have a bug which caused the ticket confirmation email not to be sent. For this last ticket I rather quickly got a reply, by email as well as by their ticket system, that a confirmation email would be sent if I was opening tickets after signing in. Their reply also had an explicit user name email address, rather then contact@. I emailed that user, and quickly got a reply my pre purchased questions were noticed. All my email messages, as well as all the tickets I have opened, were noticed. And will be answered when the owner will be available, because they are waiting for his decision. One day after that I got a short reply by email, they normally do not allow a VPS sending and receiving of email. Which was one of my pre purchase questions. Their message also asked me to write this review. Again, the review request could be by an automatic signature for the user sending me that reply. They did not answer the other 7, or 8, pre purchase questions. That is all my experience with them up to 11/30/2023.For completeness, at mid December 2023 I decided to ask them to clarify their use of the word normally in their statement of `normally not allow a vps to send and receive email'. 6 hours later, I was told `they don't normally allow sending mail on their VPS's however if the customer share his use case and acknowledge that if they receive any spam reports the port will be closed then they do open the mail port for customers.' I was also told to keep asking them if I have more questions. Once again, I do not get any reward for updating this review. I will reconsider my previous statement about not purchasing their vps, though I might choose some other option I have for a vps. For me, their offer does look compelling."

I don't have a lot of questions since I've been messing around with garrysmod servers for 5 years but it's nice to know that some of those questions were recently added in their Support Knowledgebase."
