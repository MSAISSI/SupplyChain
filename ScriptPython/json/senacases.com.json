Take a picture, send it to us and we will decide. Then remember we deduct full shipping charges from the refund. Any you pay for return shipping too. Even though they advertise a 30 day return policy, they do not want returns and make it hard to do it. Ended up keeping it so they couldn't resell it again and double their profit. BEWARE"

I was given a hard time about getting the coupon discount towards placing a new order. After several emails back and forth, I was finally offered the discount. I reordered the case and the next case had the same issue, but it wasn't as bad. After my bad experience of trying to get the credit on the first one,  I decided to place a book on the case, hoping it would flatten. It still never flattened and the tablet dies after sitting overnight because it wont shut off. I called, but because it was past 30 days, I would have to pay for shipping to return. I ordered a different brand and ended up wasting $55 on a case that won't get used"

Said they would come mid October. I called late November they did not call me to let me know that it was delayed. Called twice in December. Was told that either I could cancel the order or that they would put it on a rush shipping when it came in. I told them I would not cancel the order so the obvious thing to do would be to rush ship it when it arrived. Of course they did not do that, so when I saw it was being shipped I called and asked about my rush shipping. Ginger the one handling my calls and emailing me tried to pass the blame on to me and I said I never responded about the rush shipping. It\u2019s obvious if I did not cancel the order that I would like rush shipping. It was supposed to come Saturday, it came on Tuesday. Worst customer service I\u2019ve ever seen. They do not want to admit fault nor when it is their fault or on their end; they do not want to compensate the customer."

If you want to return the product they want you to ship it back to them with tracking. That usually cost more than to buy the crap they sell. They would not refund me on my product that was supposed to be leather but appears to be some kind of vinyl made in China. On top of that I got a bill weeks later for $16.74 from FedEx to ship it to me. This company is a total rip off beware. I am updating this review as Sena cases just replied with the same response! I promise to post here once a month forever until they refund my money. Stay away from this company.Thanks for you reply Sena Cases! You charged ME the shipping and then want me to send it back with tracking shipment and you would make a decision on a refund! That shipping cost more than your vinyl iPhone case! So in my mind you do not have a return policy. So I will not stop letting the world know to STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY."

So I called the 1-800 number for SENA cases online and spoke to someone in customer service who explained to me, \"these cases are made of heritage series leather and to just rub the blemish and the oil from your hands will make it go away\".  I have many leather products, and I know oil makes things better.  I sent pictures of the scuffed case to the address they gave me.  I was later sent a message telling me they would contact me within two days, I assumed for a resolution to this problem.  That was a week ago, so I guess their quality control department was okay with the pictures of the obviously scuffed not scratched case.  Not very happy."

The products are generally good and I have bought a few, including the new racer iPhone X case. It was delayed for 3 weeks so I missed the birthday deadline. Then I was charged \u20ac28 tax and penalties on top of the $56 price tag. Sena could give Europeans the option to pay duties in advance and avoid the extra penalties (I called DHL to verify) but they cannot be bothered. So non-US citizens pay more than double in the end and wait 3 times as long. If you are in the US - buy a great case. If you are in Europe - don't bother - there are equally good and much, much cheaper alternatives with less hassle."

Also, the front cover cannot be folded back on itself easily. I hope not to drop it again. Not sure how this case has been drop tested, and I don\u2019t want to try\u2026"
