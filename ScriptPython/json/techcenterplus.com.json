          "Titre": "Beware of Tech Center Plus",
          "Contenu": "After I received servicing from Tech Center Plus my computer stopped working.  I took it to a local computer company to have it repaired.  I was told that a rogue IT support corrupted my computer putting it out of commission.  After getting hacked I was expecting Tech Center Plus to clean up my computer but instead I got victimized again.  The local computer company got rid of the malware and repaired the computer.  Anyone using Tech Center Plus will be greatly disappointed.  They are sophisticated scam artists that will take the victim for $300 or $500 for their \u201cservice.\u201dThis is in response to Tech Center Plus to my review.  My computer stopped working after TCP worked on it.  I was not going to allow TCP to fix it as I suspected that I had  been scammed a second time.  The legitimate company that I finally hired diagnosed my problem as one caused by a rogue IT support entity-Tech Center Plus.  The Malwarebytes program had to deinstalled.  It only costs $34 for the program meanwhile TCP charged me close to $300 for a service that would have bled me dry.  Face it TCP is very clever in marketing itself as a legitimate enterprise but in reality a scammer nonetheless.  Instead of taking thousands of dollars from a single customer they take a few hundred.  They slide under the radar.  For shame!"

We were disappointed in the misrepresentation by him and your on-line posting that your company was connected to MS and/or a subcontractor to MS. Neither seems to be the case. That said, your folks do seem to know what they are doing and got us out of a real jam. We hope the year ahead of our contract with you goes well. Thank you again."
