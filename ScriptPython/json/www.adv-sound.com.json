I wrote to support about this, they kindly sent me a new pair of headphones, M5-TWS \u201cAccent Red\u201d I was happy, but they worked well for exactly 1.5 months, and then the same problem appeared with the right earbud, about 3 minutes of work  and complete discharging.  I wrote to the support service about this, and they sent me a new pair of M5-TWS \u201cAccent Red\u201d earbuds again, I received them the day before yesterday, yesterday I opened them, and no matter how I tried, the right earbud does not hold a charge at all, not a single minute.  now I have 3 pairs of non-working headphones, 3 pairs cost about $450 but play for $0+ support stopped responding to me ("

After the charging process I followed the instruction's and tried out the earbuds. Linked to the Bluetooth device on my laptop and proceeded to listen to some music.  The pairing of the earbuds was quick except for the following.  The Right earbud performed as expected it did Very Well.  The Left earbud was non-responsive.  No sound other than a couple of tones (beeps).  I checked the power connections which appeared okay.  Went to the ADV-sound Support page and followed the directions for resetting the earbuds.  No difference in the functioning of the Left earbud. My initial analysis is that either the base unit and/or the Left earbud are not receiving any power. The Right earbud is receiving power.I have contacted the ADV support group and have established an email correspondence."

It takes almost two weeks to arrive to New York, not to mention to Europe.If I know this could happen I would not even buy it. I doubt even do it again, even on the kickstarter side when I support on adv X and suggest to put a USB-C... I'm really disappointed in you, for several reasons and now this experience on shopping."

I have the comply ones and the foam in these don't rebound as fast (good thing, the fast rebound tends to hurt the ear). However, if you remove this from your ear and put it back, the foam is a little slow moving so it wont seal and may not even sense the headphone is in your ear. So you are left leaving it in your ear. The perfect fit was this, i had to remove the foam from the attachment (snaps off), and physically remove the rubber inner ring, and then take the original apple earpiece, and put this foam inside that. This is the only comfy way to get a good seal every time."

It isn't magnetic to pull the ear buds in, so you have to constantly make sure the case is closed right. Also, they aren't usb-c and don't have wireless charging. The buds are good enough for the $40 I paid. I do like the fit and the foam plugs that it comes with are a great addition. The sound quality is great. Great wide sound, for any buds, with bass and highs solid. However, they are very quite. Seems like you can't get them loud enough especially if you're walking around a busy area with them. Wouldn't recommend buying them unless they were cheaper."

The ear tips are included either don\u2019t provide a proper seal or the ones that do aside from being uncomfortable they accentuate the driver flex every time you touch the buds by pop and click sound  you are pretty much stuck to use what is supplied and literally any other tips from any other manufacture although are more comfortable fit and better seal than the default tips will not allow the case to close properly.As for the sound the Type X + version puts a lot of emphasis on bass so much so that the mids are butchered and highs are severely recessed like listening to an AM radio.It\u2019s disappointing to see the plus version that is suppose to be an upgrade has been a disappointment when compared to its predecessor the Type X which although a bit older has significantly better clarity and a respectable bass with out butchering the mids and highs to provide a far better listening experience than the type X Plus version.Having said that I am patiently waiting for the Type Y and can only hope for it to have a better sound quality than the type X Plus which at least for me was an utter disappointment."

I've purchased a few things from both Adv and their sister site, Eartune, without issue. Heard about the site from an audio reviewer website that had reviewed the Model 3 Wireless headphones (which were the first thing I bought from ADV). Since then I've purchased a wireless bluetooth receiver, a USB C to 3.5mm headphone adapter, as well as some eartip replacements! Overall a great site to buy some underrated products!"

The the sound quality, volume, bass and noise reduction all very noticeably better. Plus the improved seal makes them much more secure. They stay tight and secure when running and biking. And for the first time i can wear they kayaking.  I always feared one would fall out right into the water, but not anymore. If you\u2019re unsure of the size, I\u2019d go with the large. The memory foam like material can be squeezed, then expands in your ear to give that improved seal. The price is a huge bargain for the increased quality of sound you get."

Honestly I was surprised by how little bass there was in the mix vs my old set, and at how clear everything else was. First Impression: Impressive clarity and 3d sound.-Fit is decent, my ears are hard to fit and I appreciated them including multiple size tips. Definitely wearable for multiple hours even with the mic.-Boom mic is awesome and improves clarity for gaming, inline mic is totally adequate for phone calls and the remote's mute feature is welcome.-Build quality is light & plastic, but totally on par with the low price.I have recommended these to all of my friends. A must-have for the price, in my opinion."

This gesture resonated with me and is not something I feel most companies would do."

The stage has a medium size (compared to a pair of AKGxMassdrop K7xx) with fantasticly dedicated instruments.But besides their resolution, the biggest advantage I see in them is the speed! They go from 100 to 0 in no time. Beryllium does its job here! Well worth it!The housing is indeed a bit large and could be a bit nicer, compared to the awesomely designed housing of the TWS. But the size ofcourse acts as a ressonance body. Also I find it kind of aesthetic. The cable is nice aswell, while I dislike the carrying case. Bought a Peli 1010 instead, after I saw someone shot it with a pumpgun on yt.All in all I'd say, they're worth the price. For me, this is definitely the way I want to consume music.Nice job ADV!"

When I received the earbuds and followed the instructions they were paired with in 2 minutes when I put the earbuds in my ears I have never had a better fit. After 1-2 weeks wearing them ever day they fit perfectly sealed all outside sounds out and the music quality is great. From my dealings with Adv sound I would highly recommend this company, look no further these are perfect."
