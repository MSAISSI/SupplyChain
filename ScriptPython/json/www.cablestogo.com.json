          "Titre": "Not honoring device/manufacturer's warranty",
          "Contenu": "I'm trying to take advantage of the 5 year manufacturer's warranty on the C2G docking station I bought from CompSource. Long story short, Legrand needs the vendor that purchased the device from them, not the reseller, to contact them on my behalf for them to honor warranty. After talking to CompSource on the phone today I guess they bought the device from D&H. I've never had to do this for a manufacturer's warranty issue ever in all of my IT experience but Legrand is telling me this is the only way they will honor their warranty. Not sure why CompSource would call D&H, to have D&H call Legrand on my behalf or how the reimbursement would even work with 3 companies involved. Most likely Legrand is betting that is the case, and I'm out $250-350 dollars. Legrand is definitely going to ruin C2G."

They put me on hold for 5-10 minutes and came back on and said, \"we have no record of this order # or account # in our system.\"  This is odd since I received three confirming emails from C2G.  How can you send me email receipts and show me order statuses online, but your customer service has no record of the orders and no solutions.  Very Disappointing & Frustrating."

Logoff/Login to C2G, order goes thru.  Call later to check on order, and I'll be told that \"it prints here at the end of the day, then gets sent there, then has to be reviewed, then it will be processed, then it will be picked (if still in stock at that point), then will (might) ship.Legrand should look at a company like McMaster-Carr and learn how to execute.  They probably have 100X as many SKU's, but process and ship 99% of orders within several hours of order placement.  And they probably have a smaller staff than Legrand.My guess is that Legrand get's its collective !@#$ together, or goes out of business in the next few years.

As this would not work for me I asked them to cancel the order but they could not. They advised me that I would need to wait till the following day to speak to someone about the order. Then I asked for a Manager to call me and I received an email from the customer service person that was rude and unapologetic. I will never do business with this company again and recommend you do the same if you need your order anytime soon."

But the order did not ship out until later (10/4/22) in the evening *hours* after I contacted her. So I paid $33.00 for a cord to arrive 10/4/22 and it arrived 10/5/22 in the middle of the day. So I called to speak with a live person since the \u201cchat\u201d was so unhelpful previously and I spoke to someone who respected and understood my claim and issued a refund for my shipping fee. She was kind but her two coworkers that initially helped me ruined my experience with this company and I will not ever order from them again."

This items is out of stock until 6/2/23.\u201d\u201cThis items shows set for a backorder shipping date of 2/9 when opening the order, updating this material to ship out asap my system then updates this backorder date to 6/2/23.\u201dI ask CSR to have the warehouse manually confirm the inventory status for this item.I also ask for a callback from a manager. CSR said they\u2019ll call me, though he\u2019s confused as to why.2/14 No communication from C2G, I reach out for the 6th (maybe 7th) time, and after 20 minutes, am able to speak to a manager.The conversation was polite, he apologized for the \u201cmiscommunication\u201d; then suggested I cancel the order and go to their resellers\u2019 websites to see if I can get it from them.\t1.\tWhat miscommunication? There\u2019s a dozen problems with C2G\u2019s handling of this order, but miscommunication isn\u2019t one of them. If anything it shows their failure to even understand what\u2019s been wrong and that much went wrong.\t2.\tAccording to both the CSR and the manager, C2G/Legrand has not kept cases on this, so every time I call/chat, to them it\u2019s all from step one.\t3.\tThere\u2019s no awareness of how many times the customer had to reach out to CS, the recourse they\u2019ve tried so far, or how this may affect the customer\u2019s satisfaction. They just hear an upset customer with no tools or records to ascertain what\u2019s been going on, besides taking the customer\u2019s word or not.\t4.\tWhy do they print out orders if they\u2019re a week out from shipping them\t5.\tThey should be able to revise a \u201cprinted\u201d order that\u2019s 2-5 business days from shipping.\t6.\tThey should offer on their initiative compensation for customer satisfaction purposes, commensurate with the size of the screwup.\t7.\tExcept for Kyleigh B. on 2/2, nobody ever reached out to me or got back to me in any way.\t8.\tTheir CSR system should track excessively delayed orders, and issue notifications (and apologies) to customers so they\u2019re in the loop.\t9.\tWhen I suggested that, the manager\u2019s canned response did not even include \u201cI will forward your suggestion\u201d as lip service. It felt clear that none of what transpired should trigger any review or possible changes.\t10.\tNeedless to say, their relocation appears to have been royally botched. Though from what I gathered, my case somehow got exceptionally botched.\t11.\tAt the end of the call with the manager, I had to remind him that they should cancel the order. With a normal company I\u2019d expect that to be handled in minutes. He took my info, it\u2019s been 1.5 hours so far, and no notifications, and the order status is still what it was on 1/20: \u201cProcessing.\u201d\t12.\tNot even talking about supply chain challenges, why it should be an extra 4 months, etc.About the only thing right were the friendly tier-1 CSR's.This is my CRM report, now where\u2019s my $150K consultant fee."

Then I clicked Checkout, and opted to pay with PayPal.  After accepting the charges in PayPal, I was returned to the C2G website where I selected Free shipping.  But it wouldn't let me click Submit Order.  Instead I had to choose a payment method. I thought I already did. So I chose PayPal again and it said, Are you sure you want to change payment methods?  Yeah sure.  Then it asked me for my shipping address, and my email again.  And asked me if I wanted to setup an account.  I already did that.  Then it sent me to PayPal again.  I'll probably get charged twice.Finally after 20 minutes of going round and round it let me finish the order.Nowhere did it indicate how fast or slow Free shipping will be.  Hopefully it's adequate."

          "Contenu": "Order was blocked because of an forgotten open window - your site failed to remedy the problem or inform me what I needed to do to proceed.  It showed the item - only @ 0$0 priceNext I wished to get this Monday May 1; and your site would not show delivery dates.  I expected to be able to select options for delivery and see dates.Therefore I placed an order prematurely - not knowing anything about when I would receive the item. I wish to cancel that order if it does not arrive May 1. The web site as far as I can see did not allow me to \"edit\" the order I just placed!I therefore placed a second order - with overnight shipping 4/28 -> 4/29 or 4/30 delivery - which is very very costly and this does aggravate me and will create conflict between me and my wife!At last I fear I will get two products (the same white audio cables) and get them too late!Please phone me asap.   By the way - your chat and your phone connections did not fucntion now.  Why offer them?SincerelyN B"
