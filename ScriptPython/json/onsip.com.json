And, on top of all this the quality of voice on the telephones is terrible...\u2026.very hollow sound like the caller to whom I am listening is 500 miles away.  I have use the volume control but the lousy sound has nothing to do with the volume.  Going to ONSIP system was an absolute terrible mistake."

I BELIEVE it is now resolved (over 3 months later).I can understand technical problems with a transition and I tried my best to be patient as the tech's worked thru both of these issues - but I am VERY disappointed with the communication process during this entire onboarding process... if we called in - everyone we spoke to was accommodating and helpful but once this left the front line - there was literally NO communication - my sales REP completely dropped us - the technicians did not reach out to troubleshoot and I feel like the entire BLF problem was not being addressed until I screamed loud enough -  we finally a tech that was actively working on it and communicating - AUG timeframe... once he 'thought' it was fixed - he stopped communicating even though we were still reporting issues... We only 'THINK\" it is fixed because we have not noticed it being an issue - no one has checked in to confirm that - except out IT providers who have had a similar experience with the communications - pretty bad considering they are the ones that referred us to you."

The pricing model also is not good for most businesses.  You will need several user accounts for each user if you actually want to have decent call handling capabilities (knowing if a call is sales or support related, if you want to have an intercom setup etc).  Hopefully OnSip will develop more features common for business phone systems and modify their pricing model.  For example, a user alias counts as a new user... defeating the whole purpose of using aliases.  If you have three appearances for a user, that is already almost $60 per month.  Other systems have more capabilities at much lower cost."

          "Contenu": "Good value for the money spent.  Support is excellent when it is available but I find not having weekend phone support sometimes limiting.  When Onsip support is available it is top notch.  It is also provided by people speaking English as a first language.  Their web site integration with sayso is a nice feature allowing a nice phone transition to a person but I fear that the lack of a true texting experience is a gap which causes you to engage other service providers to provide that feature.  Call quality is excellent but we experience call scenarios where calls are connected but the calling party does not hear the caller right away which leads to a rough beginnings to calls.  Music on hold as well as custom messages has not worked with web or application based phones only with a hard phone.  This leaves clients/customers/patients listening to dead air often resulting in them believing the call has been disconnected and they hang up.  It is being remedied but this is a basic feature for any business system and another big gap in features especially if you want to run your office without physical phones.  OnSIP is our first foray into VoIP and we have enjoyed a good value for the money.  However the lack of integrated SMS/MMS texting, fax service (this is not encouraged), a good inter-office chat feature (they have one, but only using the desktop app) and the lack of other features like file sharing or screen sharing is leading us to investigate other providers that offer these integrations.  We have too many agreements and providers to bring unified communications to our office and customers.  I wish OnSIP had this stuff because their support and configuration is great.  However we have a business to run."

A couple of improvements we would like to see from OnSIP is support for SIP calls over TCP and TLS for better compatibility with platforms like WebEx. We would also like a much more eye-friendly user interface for the softphones, and the ability to log the softphone app into multiple OnSIP accounts at the same time, easily selecting one of those when placing calls. The closer the experience gets to the full power of a top-end Polycom, Cisco, or Yealink phone the better."

They also make creation of virtual PBX systems very easy. Non-technical users who can handle email and photocopiers can usually take pick up OnSIP administration functions after only minimal training. The system is so flexible that it can be used to create virtual key systems for those used to having their inbound phone lines appear on all of their phones. OnSIP-provided phone app software ought to support multiple accounts at the same time to function more like high-end VoIP desk phones, or OnSIP should consider a operator/reception app for users who would otherwise have a high-end VoIP phone with a light-panel sidecar. Conferencing capabilities on the OnSIP platform could use improvement. We would like to see conferencing capabilities comparable to TurboBridge.com, Dialpad, or Zoom."

OnSip reps have always been helpful and patient with our questions, and have proven themselves to be very knowledgeable about their business. In particular, Eden Harvest was essential in facilitating our transition from our former provider to OnSip. He answered all of our questions comprehensively and quickly, and was great to work with. He really is an asset to OnSip, and I'd would recommend anyone interested in adopting a VOIP system work with him. We are very happy with OnSip and it has solved many, many of our issues. I would absolutely recommend OnSip and Eden Harvest."

Eden Harvest and his team were so thoughtful and supportive every step of the way. He successfully programmed our system and trained us on how to use the phones, Eden even coordinated with our IT professionals and remained in contact during the actual day of install and when we finally went live! My team and I love OnSIP and our new phones - we have already used the remote features during the last snow storm and are loving the ease of use, transferring calls, changing hold messages etc. Eden\u2019s attention to detail and committed support was critical and the reason we had such a positive and successful switch of our telecommunications system. We couldn\u2019t be more grateful and we 100% recommend Eden Harvest and OnSIP to any small business looking for cutting edge telecommunications solutions! Megan HThe Spa at Litchfield Hills"
