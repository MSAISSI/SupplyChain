          "Contenu": "THIS IS THE WORST FAX PLATFORM EVER! DO NOT USE!!!!!!We searched for several companies before making our decision and chose Humblefax because of their claims for unlimited faxing and no hidden fees. Within a week, they canceled our plan without any warning saying that they do not actually offer unlimited faxing and that we needed to pay them more money. It was frustrating because it also impacted our clients in the medical field. They gave us no warning and told us that they do not actually offer unlimited faxes. We had a very negative experience with Adam Carpentieri from their team. I hardly ever write a bad review and try to be understanding of the challenges of running a business. However, the fact that they blatantly lied about offering unlimited (we didn't even send that many faxes!), cut off our subscription (despite paying for a full month), and sent us horrible messages was beyond anything we had experienced before. Most of our team is BIPOC and they were quite aware of this too so it actually seems extremely racist which is very sad. I would never recommend using them because they will take your money, cancel your subscription before the month ends, and will send you horrible emails. Total scammers!"

          "Contenu": "I have tried for months to cancel this account! I was not able to port a fax number I've had for 20 years into Humble Fax, so I've had no choice but to close this account. Any company that won't provide a customer service number is questionable. After a few months of pulling a monthly fee (without ONE transaction), I finally had to remove my credit card, so that I'm not continually being charged. I've tried using their \"contact us\" page, I've tried emailing their \"support\" email address, and I'm completely frustrated with this situation! I do NOT recommend using Humble Fax! Their customer service is non-existent.8/14/2023 Update: I continue to receive emails threatening to cancel my account (almost every day I receive them) even though I've repeatedly requested that they DO cancel it. If anyone has a phone number I can call to get the cancellation finalized once and for all, I would appreciate it. Once this organization is out of my hair for good, I will be extremely happy!"

          "Contenu": "I have been using Humblefax since October 2022, and I was initially very happy with the service. I need to send large faxes a few times a month, and the $10.00 per month unlimited faxing was a competitive price.Anyway, this month, they decided that my faxing pattern, which has remained the same from the beginning, went against their policies. This has made it clear to me that this company is not truly an unlimited faxing service, as advertised. They were, I am guessing, losing money from my use of their service, and they needed to make an excuse to transfer me to their limited faxing service. I initially thought I was fine with being transferred to their limited service, but after dealing with their terrible customer service, I decided to stop using their service. Thankfully, I found another company that has a similar setup as theirs, and their reviews on BBB are better. If you are curious, Humblefax's BBB rating is an F."

          "Contenu": "i joined monthly on 6/23. i paid the 10.00 fee and began working.  a week or so in i saw that my billing info was stored. I am 66 and disabled on ONLY a social security debit card.  I receive no other income and I do NOT use credit cards at all.  So i removed the info and watched the days as they came close to having to make my next payment.  I heard nothing until 7/24 when they sent a reminder for me to update my billing information. it was a couple days away anyway so i just put in the info to see that the payment would go through. And it did on the 7/24. After it paid out I again removed the info. And I responded back to that email of 7/24 explaining my concern of having this only means of income floating around the internet when cyber hacking is common. They responded that they understood and that it was fine.  Also let me know that they do not hold the info, they send a token to STRIPE.com, who hold it.  This really concerned me because now it is somewhere else but being that i was able to remove it was okay...UNTIL 8/5 I get another auto message stated...We are sorry to see you go.... That they cancelled my account, released my fax number and files are gone!!!  And would i explain why i cancelled??!!I immediately responded back telling them this same conversation and to date NOBODY has responded and it is now 8/9.  I lost 5 days of sending and my work is now backed up.  I also sent messages directly to website where i normally fax from and again the 24/7 support has not responded either,i have the email of the correspondence and the person who responded and told me they understood and that it was fine.  The site is amazing otherwise but NOBODY she be forced into keeping their debit or credit out on an outside source.  Why can't the info be removed until the next payment is due???  Why not have that option like most business do.  If they DO NOT pay on time of course you would cancel.  So I paid 10.00 for 8 days, lost the rest, have no fax number or files available.  I feel this is very unjust.  Disappointed8/13 update NOT ONE RESPONSE8/29 Still not one response.ALL DONE"

          "Contenu": "The service that Humble Fax provides is limited. There is an hour response time before the fax let\u2019s you know if there was a fax failure or fax confirmation and if the fax fails you\u2019re left with the bill. Faxing large documents is not possible and even when you break down your initial fax into smaller sized documents the faxing tends to fail or send more pages than was originally in your documentation. Once you contact a representative from Humble Fax a shortened curt and rude response is given each time. Humble fax may possibly work for average one to five page documents but it simply didn\u2019t work for me. I had to go out to an outside fax provider to have my fax properly sent through a machine that was not initiated by a FOIP. I asked for a refund and was told no repeatedly even after explaining my situation when the person responded \u201cHuh?\u201d to my email. Do not waste your time and money on this service there are other FOIP fax service providers that are more reputable and have a proper customer service team that responds with courtesy."

I end-up driving to UPS Store 45 miles away to send a fax. I asked HumbleFax for some kind of a refund with no luck. After I cancel my account they still to charge my credit card. DO NOT USE THEM FOR THIS SERVICE.UPDATE: I was not my password access to you sit, it was the website down for a long time. I understand that a site can be down sometimes, is that the fact it was down for such a long time. What was the possibility that your website was down only once in 3 months that I had the service with your? I was paying only to use it in case of emergency, where I did not had access to a store that can let me send a fax, when I needed too. You site was down for a very long time. So in the end your service is very unreliable, please avoid this company for service."

          "Contenu": "Warning: HumbleFax doesn't want you to see bad reviews, they try to report them to get them removed. Great service when it worked. Sleek UI. Faxes went through with confirmation, every time. I don't think I had really any bugs using HumbleFax. Setup was near perfect. A five star platform. Then I found my account suspended despite advertising all over the website and subscription for \"unlimited faxing\" forcing me to pay for an upgraded service several times the original $10 as originally advertised. Further inspection of reviews proves that my experience has been certainly replicated multiple times, so I am happy to find I am not being \"singled out\" and this is a pattern of behavior/abuse from the owner who I guess changes his mind about how much faxing is worth $10. I finally found the terms of service shows this and also that the owner can also inspect and read your \"confidential\" faxes raising some serious privacy concerns for sensitive information. Thank you HumbleFax for the great faxing experience while it lasted. I apologize for the one star review but having to pay considerably more for what was originally sold as $10 for unlimited faxing is a deal-breaker."

          "Contenu": "Humble Fax homepage and FAQ say: \"$10 per month to send and receive unlimited faxes. No gimmicks, no hidden fees, no overage charges.\" ... however their Terms of Service say: \"The Company offers several account types, including but not limited to basic unlimited accounts for personal use, tiered accounts, and metered accounts. For individual, non-commercial use, we offer unlimited faxing accounts. Our tiered accounts accommodate customers with regular volume of faxes. Finally, we offer a metered option based on specific usage amounts.\"  So which is it? What is their actual pricing? The tiered or metered prices are nowhere to be found. (I have emailed the company and will update my review if they respond.)*** UPDATE ON 07-22-2020 ****When this review was originally posted, HumbleFax customer service tracked down my personal email and accused me of lying and violating TrustPilot terms of service (over the course of several emails). I did ask them what their actual pricing was but they never replied. Since then, they took down this review twice, first because I was \"not a customer\", and the second time for \"defamatory statements\" (thankfully, TrustPilot's customer service intervened and re-instated my review). As you can see on the company activity page they've flagged over 95% of their negative reviews, probably for similarly made-up reasons.For what it's worth I am currently using SRFax, it's reliable and cheaper than HumbleFax."

          "Contenu": "I absolutely loved this service the first couple of months. $10 dollars a month for unlimited faxes? What a deal! Things changed soon after though. My service was interrupted and I was instructed to re enter my billing information and the new rate would be $20 per month. In the email I was told the business rate was $20 per month ; therefore, I had to pay the higher rate. Fair enough I guess, even though the website had no obvious statements regarding personal versus business rates, just unlimited. I decide it must be buried somewhere in the terms and just decided to move on. Fast forward to the next month. Once again, my service is interrupted and I'm am asked to pay an increased rate, $30. I sent 3 or 4 emails asking a few questions for clarification purposes: what are your rates in addition to the unlimited plan, will my service be interrupted every month if my volume continues to vary, where in the terms is this discussed etc.... Every response consisted of 1 or 2 vaguely construed sentences that inferred I am getting a quality service for the lowest available price. None of my questions were answered. To be fair my volume increased from about 800 to 2000 pages, but I was not warned my service would be interrupted if my volume changed. I still cant get a response as to what their \"true rates\" are.  I  also requested a returned phone call  that has not happened. Very frustrating!Update, another vague response just received:Generally we try to charge .02 cents per page. Your Support Team,"

I would avoid at all cost!Here is their reply. \"Sir, our service will keep billing you until you cancel. That is how all subscription services work. In this case, it costs us money to renew the phone number associated with your account every month to keep it active with your account. If we stopped billing you then you would lose your number.Please stop using accusatory language, we did nothing wrong here.Your Support Team,\"\"Dear Iamsueoh,Your account was deactivated for non payment.

Easy to use, with so many great extra features (scheduled faxing, contact saving to name a few) Highly recommended - I will be a customer for life."

We love having multiple users being able to independently log in access the account and send faxes. Keep in mind when adding users, that all emails receive all faxes. If you have someone that routinely gets very sensitive information, they should be set up with a separate account that isn't shared with other users. (There are some limits you can put on, but I'm not certain if any would solve this issue, as we do not limit any of our users)We would definitely recommend this service"

They told me no, so I went searching for a better solution. That's when I came across Humblefax. Not only was the cost per month less but, they offer a way to block junk faxes! It will also automatically retry sending a fax if it doesn't go through the first time. After using the program for a couple of months I am thrilled that I made the change. The user interface is modern, clean and so easy to navigate. I highly recommend Humblefax!"

I used to use a VOIP service to a printer/scanner/fax, but I'm without my printer right now and this is much better!  No need to worry about configuring the VOIP stuff, it just works, period.  Compared to other providers with quotas on how many faxes you can send and receive, this is brilliant because now I don't have to worry about spending the quota.  The faxes come as a PDF right to my email and there are tons of settings to play with in the control panel.  Best of it, it's quick and easy to make a cover page and upload a PDF document to attach to the cover-letter that contains your fax message.  So far, I'm loving it.  I will never not have a fax again!"
