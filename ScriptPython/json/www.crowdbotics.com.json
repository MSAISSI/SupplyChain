          "Contenu": "1. Misleading Representation:I entered into an agreement with Crowdbotics based on their claim that they possessed the necessary capabilities to develop the project I requested. However, soon after the payment was made, I was informed that the desired project was beyond their scope. This discrepancy in representation misled me and eroded my confidence in Crowdbotics' integrity.2. Extended Project Timeline:Initially, I was informed that the project would be completed within a reasonable timeframe of approximately 5 months. Regrettably, despite more than a year of collaboration, not a single item outlined in the Product Requirement Document has been accomplished. This excessive delay demonstrates a lack of commitment to meeting agreed-upon deadlines.3. Inadequate UI Design Contribution:A significant portion of the UI design was undertaken by myself rather than Crowdbotics, indicating afailure to fulfill the obligations outlined in our agreement. This lack of input from their side undermines the value and quality of the services I expected from Crowdbotics.4. Frequent Team Personnel Changes:Throughout the course of our engagement, there have been multiple instances of team personnelchanges, leading to inconsistencies and disruptions in the project's progress. These changes havehindered effective communication, impeded knowledge transfer, and further contributed to the project'sstagnation.5. Harassment for Payment:I have experienced persistent harassment from Crowdbotics regarding payment for upcomingmilestones, despite the fact that the initial milestone outlined in the agreement remains incomplete.This pressure to pay for unfinished work is unacceptable and suggests a lack of professionalism and disregard for our contractual terms.6. Ignored Feedback:Repeatedly, my feedback and suggestions for each iteration of the build have been ignored,demonstrating a failure to incorporate client input into the development process. This disregard forfeedback severely hampers the collaborative nature of our engagement and undermines the likelihoodof achieving a satisfactory outcome.Please note that this review reflects my personal experience and opinion as a dissatisfied client. Your experience with Crowdbotics Corporation may vary."

          "Contenu": "Scammers be aware!!! You will not be able to call or contact the supervisor. There is no number to call. When I asked Jovana for her supervisor's phone number she just said no. This is an insane company. I paid 2800$ upfront to complete the app. They said they will complete it in 3 months so I should sign up for a premium subscription and I Will receive weekly updates. Well a year later 6500$ was Spent on their subscription, and with no weekly updates was very hard to contact them. They keep working on the wrong app that looks like 10 year old made it. They kept stretching the time so I could not call the bank and cancel . I keep telling them they are working on the wrong app, and they just tell me they will work on my app but they keep sending me after 3 months same app that is not functional nothing works. It is just 3 page simple app. Each time they convince me that they will work on the correct app so I don't cancel the subscription and when I ask for weekly updates they just come up with an excuse. Not worth the risk and programmers are from other countries that have very minimal skills or education in programming. Also, programmers are from high-risk scamming countries, this is a big security problem!! You can get a better job done from youtube tutorials. The company is clearly run by scammer criminals. Do not recommend risking getting scammed. Looks like I'm not the only one."

I was told that the ask was unclear and it was being investigated like it was a bug. It was not until I complained, that things moved forward. The project would have finished closer to my desired time if this did not happen. Once it was escalated and the development was under way, the rest of the process went smooth. From there the team was attentive, helped resolve bugs and launch the feature in a timely manner."

The app had many features and fairly complicated workflows involved, including numerous API calls and specific features needed for a dropshipping business. Crowdbotics built this for me at a solid rate - when the contract was signed a whole team was assigned to my app, which was very impressive. Communication was always quick and effective, and tasks were tackled in a very timely manner. My team was awesome to work with and always explained tasks clearly. The app is looking great and all features we could need are ready. Looking forward to launching it on Shopify shortly!"

          "Contenu": "I had looked into \"do it yourself\" type mobile app development platforms to develop an app based on an idea for an educational tool. I contacted a number of companies, trying to save some money without sacrificing quality (sounds impossible, right). I came across Crowdbotics in mid-2020 but decided against them because of the monthly cost, although I was interested in their approach to developing mobile apps\u2014they have a modular approach which seemed to be different from all others I checked out. After trying several platforms and not being satisfied with the results, I went back to Crowdbotics and arranged an initial meeting to discuss my app idea. They were professional, capable and willing to work with my budget. I agreed to work with them and within days, was assigned a project manager who scheduled a kickoff call to review the requirements of the app. After confirming the details, they started development. The project manager contacted me weekly and scheduled regular calls to keep me up to date and to show me the progress via live video chats and demonstrations. Her development team was very responsive. What impressed me most was how, after only 3 months, the app was up and running. The Crowdbotics team was communicative, keeping me informed with each step, and syncing regularly with me regarding milestones and timelines. Often, they kept me on track. In the end, they developed the app, based on my requirements, and did it in record time. They have a solid team and have been great to work with. I've been very pleased with the results and glad I went with Crowdbotics."
