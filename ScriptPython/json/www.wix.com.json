          "Contenu": "I've recently switched from Squarespace thinking the templates are more useful for my current project and I completely regret it. I don't know how they built their model but it's not user/customer focused, but seems to be some kind of mechanical system built to make money with customer/user experience being far from a priority. So many issues doing simple things like deleting slides, finding HEX codes, lack of consistency in so many ways. They refused a refund even though the products were falsely advertised as \"you can change the colour scheme at any time\" when after you purchase the colour schemes you viewed purchase are no longer available. They expect you to manually find and enter the HEX codes. So many problems. I've built sites on Squarespace and the customer service is heaps better, as well as general customer orientated model that makes things easier for those who are not graphic designers , for example. DO NOT RECOMMEND. I WILL BE MOVING MY SITE ASAP."

They gave no warning they were going to do this, or option to change anything in anyway - so I believed my card had been stolen and cancelled it!Secondly my plan was \u00a3268.93 when I subscribed 3 years ago. My renewal price is \u00a3561.60 for the same plan. You cannot tell me that is justifiable in any way. I cannot afford that in the current climate and the fact they tried to take it early is disgusting."

Unfortunately, I found this out after their 14 day refund guarantee had ended. So if i wanted a useful website I would lose ~$180 AUD and than have to fork out more money to upgrade to the Editor X subscription. Wix SEO is still terrible despite them making changes. They don't listen to the community on votes for features. I'm moving to wordpress after this scam. Not trusting them if this is how they treat long time subscribers. If you have to use Wix go with editor X first up though don't expect them to not pull this scam again where they cut out there subscriber base because there not willing to fork out a whole new plan and discard there old one and the money that went with it. From chatting with them it sounds like they have done this in the past as well with another older editor."

How has someone gotten access to my business number, and is using it to call and harass people!!?? Second, I have been blocking the numbers, but more numbers keep calling me for 12 hours straight, leaving messages that my business line is harassing them. THIRD, I SHOULD NOT have to purchase another number!!! Are you kidding me, Wix??This is impacting my business, my livelihood, and my source of income. Don't use Wix. They are completely unhelpful. They just take your money and disregard any concerns, especially serious ones.Update: December 11, 2023I have had to make a fake website and transfer the number that was hacked to that site. I had to purchase a new number. The temporary fake site accumulated over 100 calls in one day and another 74 the next day.

I was paying 14euros for their email marketing services, I set up a  great system using it, then boom! Next day they charge 71euros for the same service. I'm essentially being forced to pay because email marketing brings in a decent amount of revenue and if I don't, all the email automations and subscription boxes just stop working. This is just one of many times they've done this over the 6 years I've been a user. After being a user for so long, I can tell you without a doubt that Wix cares primarily about increasing revenue and very little about its users."

Also, I think it\u2019s pretty weird that Wix headquarters is in Israel, where the internet access (which Wix needs to run!) is available, and it is not too far away from Palestinian communities with no access to internet. Wix supports and is benefitted by an apartheid state. If I didn\u2019t have to use this website to pass a class, I would have boycotted it a long time ago."

I had originally installed it a few months ago- made revisions and wanted to amend but instead deleted 2 of the 3 columns-i could not retreive any of it-even using the useful site history saviour. So I uninstalled the app-save and then re install-but it reappears as just one column not 3 and will not work-this is having a huge impact as the other payment apps are branded and inferior so I cannot trade.  Oh issue 3-there is no mechanism to seek out Wix for them to quickly correct this so instead I am left in limbo and paralysis-unable to do anything-so whatever the good sides of Wix and there are many-it remains completely pointless to me-having worked on my site for some 5 months and endure the agonies of speed and movement plus inability to trade-I cannot praise it as it standsif you want to actually go into my site and resolve this or insanely email me to liberate me and solve these minor but crippling matters I await with much hopethanks"

With Wix fees/interest rates, it also doesn't help when \u00a3450.00 turns into \u00a3440.00!  It may only be \u00a310.00 but that \u00a310.00 can mean all the difference when you are operating on a cash in/cash out basis and it comes to purchasing materials, travel and accommodation etc to provide your services to the client.

          "Contenu": "We recently fixed an issue with some incorrect nameservers - the domain in question had old Wix nameservers and we needed to update the domain to new ones also at Wix.The namerservers were changed and - as usual - dns checks across the globe start recognising these new nameservers at different speeds. Some servers pick the new ones up, other servers take a few hours.Not Wix - they have some sort of hard coded schedule so that it takes specifically 48 hours before they do a new DNS lookup.In our case this means no web site and no email for 48 hours.When questioned, Wix seemed to be aware of this issue but said they \"have no procedure in place\" to expedite a refresh of domains they host the name servers for.We host hundreds of domains and frequently make changes to nameservers and DNS records and the only time we see actual delays is with Wix, so we have to sit this one out.We've had similar issues in the past.We do not recommend Wix for this reason."

I just finished redoing my artist's website only to find out that my website does not display properly on ipads.  I am going to assume that this is true for tablets as well.  Wix uses the middle section of the computer display to format for ipads.  This means that you have to limit your website to the fairly narrow middle section of the display page.  This looks very dated as most people have wider screens.  My website looks great on a computer and also on an iphone but I will have to move my site to a different platform -- probably WordPress in order to get true multi-device responsiveness.  Wix says that they are thinking about solving this problem but I think that they are 10 years behind the times and any website owner needs to know that around 55% of all web traffic goes to mobile devices and tablets.  Plus your SEO will suffer if you cut out a large portion of potential traffic!"

They say it doesn't exist.- WIX has disabled paid features on my account without notice, impacting my business operations. Showed no interest in reactivating it in a timely manner.- WIX continues to bloat the dashboard with ads for features I've already bought. They won't go away. No \"dismiss\" button.- WIX inbound calls are screened out by Verizon because they trigger the scam call alarm. So even if I ask for a callback, it never comes through.- WIX isn't too good about understanding the nuances between a non profit and a for profit. Every algorithm assumes you are a operating a large scale storefront, twisting the system into processes that are simply non-applicable.- WIX has an office in New York. But I can only reach third party agents in New Delhi with limited access to system controls. And only through the chatbot, which incessantly brow beats me into trying to accept answers for problems I don't have.- The WIX owner app often lags and freezes when too much text is entered. Happens with nearly any field in the app.- My website came out pretty good. And I've been able to be somewhat productive on my own without WIX help. So I'll give two stars for that.If you are thinking about switching to WIX, don't. I've been with them over a year and they have only left me tasting anger every time I've tried to reach them for anything."

I run a small business and rely on my wix site for bookings. Today I really needed some customer service but I got nothing. I tweeted about 20 times as the customer service part of wix was not working. I would hesitate to recommend using Wix for your business needs after todays shambolic service. I lost money today because of Wix.Update: 10th July 09:00Day 2 And Wix is still down for many businesses but wix still claim it isn't. Social media shows it is.No explanation and no help from wix so far.Update:10th July 3.30pmFinally was able to speak to someone after two days. The person on the phone was very helpful and very patient. The problem of getting hold of customer service personnel when Wix is not working remains but the two customer service agents I spoke to were brilliant. The system is so flawed though. If wix is down, there is no customer service option to go to online or elsewhere. I still hesitate to recommend wix as a means of running a business as I lost two days of bookings in total.Update 11th JulyWix have reached out to apologise which was decent of them. There seems to be no resolution to my concern of not being able to contact customer services when the wix log in page is down though. I've upgraded from a 1 star to a 2 review star as I am a little less frustrated now but still, without a customer service phone number or email to contact, the problem remains. The service itself - i.e my website and booking system from Wix are well worthy of a five star review when everything is working. My comments on this thread are simply about contacting customer services - not the actual product wix provides which is excellent."

However, there are a few major issues I have with Wix, the first one being that you cannot remove billing fields from the checkout page, I sell digital products so all I need is their email address and country, the unneeded information required is is giving my customers a terrible user experience and would hate to think how much revenue i've lost because of this. I don't even use Wix as a payment processor, I use Stripe, they have this feature, WHY can't I remove these fields if you don't manage my payments???Secondly, not being able to edit individual product pages, I have different products, I NEED to add different features to each product, yes I know you can use the product editor to add details but I need to specifically edit the page.Thirdly, not being able to add options to digital products, I have one single digital product with 12 options, I have to list these all as separate products! This is inconvenient and I really don\u2019t understand why this isn\u2019t available, it\u2019s such a simple thing, so, why?These issues are having a HUGE impact on my conversion rate.The only other thing I have to say that isn't the greatest is the constant bombardment of emails to upgrade my plan, today only! (sends everyday) I understand this is just marketing and I myself use tactics like this but sending me these emails everyday is just excessive.I think it's time for me to move on from Wix, it's a shame as it is a great platform apart from a few shortcomings.Edit: just something to add to this, I am now experiencing buggy pages on my Wix website, I have not changed anything that would cause this and my customers are having to refresh multiple times just to see the page! This is losing me revenue now, time to move on."

I called in, was on the phone for 30 minutes had to use multiple different devices, as only certain laptops can open a link I was being sent (very peculiar ). Eventually I was going back through the same steps I have already done, nothing different was done exactly the same, so no sense made there. Then miraculously the email box was working.I Then needed to look at a website, it was only at this point i discovered I could of got the domain free with a site but, either way it was too late for that. I attempted to use the website builder and it was atrocious, absolutely shocking! I gave up after two attempts.I moved over to another company, got on really well with their website builder, it was like night and day, the difference. I then attempted to use my domain with this website, only to discover that something was wrong with my Domain, and it was not set up correctly, they gave instruction on how to correct this issue.Upon going Back to the WIX site, it turns out there\u2019s a domain lock in forced, so I cannot use my domain elsewhere until after April 1st. Which I did not know about, I now am doing nothing as i am so fed up with it. Constantly having issues, I have got some help in places, I just wish the problems would keep happening so frequently. I now do not know what to do. I can use WIX\u2019s website builder as it is shocking but I\u2019m stuck and cannot use anyone else\u2019s with the domain I have paid good money for. So My business is now at a stand still, and I trading over social media as I cannot do a website with out getting another domain and changing all my advertising. Or waiting until April.Not great!"

Then, I found out their support is useless - it's all web driven options that take you round in circles (like the windmills in your mind)! I hadn't forgot my password, I can access my login email but after 20 minutes trying to contact support person I gave up as I was constantly being sent to an inappropriate help page or options that don't relate to my issue.I can login with Google OK but I still cannot reset my password as the original one has changed. What a palava!! So much for me upgrading as this has really put me off.Update 11/02/23I took the chance and ordered Business / Premium package but had to use a new account (given issues with getting emails from Wix as per above). Now that I have had opportunity to utilise functions and kick off website construction for a client I am very content with the structure albeit I have yet had issue to warrant contact of support again. I have previously used SmugMug and other platforms and thus far Wix appears to offer a more comprehensive toolset. I have therefore upgraded my experience from 2 to 4 stars.Update 09/07: Another website and same issues trying to contact technical assistance - this time in relation to an embedded gallery working fine in 'preview' but not displaying correctly on 'test' site. Virtually impossible to get through to someone without trying to waste time finding your way through a maze of BS - page after page - going round in circles - link upon link upon link and then back to original link. What's wrong with these companies they can't just have a simple direct contact?"

Which is strange since your customer support staff informed me they will be available. Also a lot of my support questions are being answered with: ''this is not a feature thats currently possible on Wix. '' after a lot of back and forth with the team. I repeatedly asked if it is available in Studio but there is no response to that. I asked this person if they can connect me to a Wix Studio staff member to find out how I can make it happen. It's disappointing that there are closed answers without any possible resolutions after I have to put a lot of time and effort into trying to even get in touch with someone from the support team.Previous complaint:I've been a Wix client for 6+ years. I manage 10+ client websites but I've been really disappointed in the last few months. It's really hard to chat to someone from support regarding editor or Wix Studio. I find it really strange that with the amount of websites I manage, create and new clients I bring on for Wix I don't have someone to chat to. For such a big tech company, it's really disappointing. I found a way to get in touch with chat support by asking for billing support and telling the bot that I want to upgrade to a premium plan. That's the only way you can get chat support if you are telling them that you would like to pay more money. Unfortunately the people I get in touch with don't have any editor experience and can't answer any design questions, even basic questions. I also have been told a couple time that I should start the chat bot again because it's not their job to answer editor questions. Even though the bot clearly states at the start of the conversation that the support agent can help you with design questions.When I do get in touch with someone from support via email it seems like I'm just being send around. Issue 1 is being answered by person A, but it seems like person A doesn't read the full chat conversation. So I have to explain to them the issue again and person B answers the email. With a solution that absolutely not helps and also clearly shows that they haven't been reading the previous communication. I've been so frustrated with this. I'm trying to resolve my technical issues by rebuilding some of the websites on Wix Studio but there is so little information on detailed questions. I can't use Wix Editor X because I have Wix Studio. At least make sure that there is a dedicated support team if you roll something new out. I still can't get any support and the support article don't have any information either.I have been now trying to get the existing support team that I've been chatting to for the last 3 days to send through my questions to a Wix Studio support agent. Even that seems to be challenging. I tried to leave a complaint via the chat bot. Even that wasn't possible so I really hope someone from the Wix team reads this. Not sure what to do anymore.Thumbs up though to all the people in Wix Facebook groups. You have been really helpful, just too bad that the software I'm paying a lot of money for is not the one trying to make an effort to help me."

          "Contenu": "Overall, after five years of running my website with Wix premium. I am no longer able to trust them to represent my brand. They were great to start with: easy, simple and have good customer service. However, once you have established a successful brand - you'd need to know that Wix has multiple glitches where your mobile website version will distort, change shape, fonts will change the size, texts will merge on top of the other, and other unpleasant surprises pointed out by your loyal clients and cause embarrassment. You'd be responsible like me - checking your website regularly to spot these glitches in advance. But you will have to eventually give up being the police to the website builder you are paying to. Once you've established a good ground using Wix, you'd want to find a provider with a more trustful infrastructure and maintenance, better email marketing options, which are currently astonishingly poor, and, if you are using Wix Bookings - has more to offer than their quite cheap version. The Mobile app to manage your business is also very basic and very often gets stuck or crash. I wish Wix all the best with building their product, but I have to warn those who are building theirs with them."

You add a button but cannot move it beyond left and right, top and bottom.The user interface maybe the worse user interface ever designed. The boxes are tiny, and there is just way to many tabs and different sections to edit basic functions. You click manage then back to settings, then back to design, each takes 5 seconds to load. It's frustrating.It's very slow. It can be a 5 to 10 second wait for just changing a colour.Some elements have more options for customisation than others. There is no way to know which, it's random and you just have to click random elements until you know what can do what.Cannot link to a product only to the shop.Added links to elements take 5 seconds to start loading the link. The user is given no feedback that anything is happening. That's crazy slow for 2020sThe app store is overpriced for basic functions. Often monthly fees that are greater than wix subscription itself, making it pointless.I can't find a way to just show the free apps.ProsHas a the ability to make a subscription area and this is fairly simple to make."

          "Contenu": "Wix has been great to help me learn the ropes of eCommerce web dev, but honestly, the product is overpriced, overhyped and under-performs. Lack of robust currency management, restricted templates, additional costs for basic automation, very poor SEO / indexing performance, clunky click and drop UI, lack of true tablet responsiveness, lack of language-based sitemaps, expensive Facebook CPM/CPC's and a weird pay upfront media cost on a rolling subscription model. It should be known that Facebook operate a post-pay model and their CPM's are a fraction of what WIX charges - They pocket both interest on the balance, and the increase on the CPM's (cost of media is inflated). Anyone with an understanding of Business Ads Manager will know that the WIX product for social ads is a complete rip-off. The cost of a month's subscription gets you a fabulous Wordpress / WooCommerce template. If you've got some base skills or access to a developer, and the willingness to scale your business, look elsewhere. If you want something super basic, super 'managed' with minimal customisation or personalisation then Wix is your go-to. Good luck scaling a business that won't rank on Google and looks like every other basic, failed, online business. I tried getting support with GA4 tracking issues, the customer service team were friendly but useless. Avoid WIX - It's not saving you money, or time.UPDATE: One month laterSwitched to WordPress, 65 of 120 pages are now indexed and ranking well on Google where previously only 8/100 pages were indexed. SEO performance has massively improved."

The page had loads of photos and information about the holiday caravans. It also had the booking calendar for each caravan. It is now blank.

The down site to a lot of options are if you are doing it for the first time it's hard to know what you must include for a compliant website, and it's a modular approach which can be frustrating, each item costs on top of the subscription fees, so you do end up looking for other cheaper options, as not all start-up can afford all the bells and whistles - I would suggest that WIXs look into having a business start-up package that includes everything that is needed for the 1 year.

The major con is, this time around building my new website I could not get the editor to work right. I would spend hours editing my site, save it, publish it and the next day I would log back on and everything would be misaligned, crooked, out of place, shrunken or oversized, font changes, color changes. It was funky and I would have to spend another two hours to fix it just for it to do it again two days later. It was little things here and there every time Id log in but it made my website real ugly. They also don't allow for category filtering on the mobile site which was irritating. Customer service on wix is excellent."

In 2023 the site started charging per email to send more than 500 emails in a month. That is a very small amount of emails, if you have even a few hundred subscribers. You'll notice as you use Wix that some features and bundles are priced in a way that seems designed to force you to upgrade. Wix contacted me about this review but in order to answer them I would to disclose who I am and what website I own. That seems counterproductive to being able to give anonymous reviews on Trustpilot."

The WIX support person I spoke to had no real knowledge of why this was happening.  The problem mysteriously fixed itself after many resubmissions of the same campaign. But this stopped again a few days later after making a minor advert change and wouldn't even run the original ad. Have so many hours trying to get fix this and to get meaningful support. Kept on line for an hour on a third call after which the call was killed. Mysteriously, the ad started going live again but I have no confidence.  No explanation given for previous problems. The WIX ecommerce suite is excellent but for advertising I'll go elsewhere, at least for the short term.Update : Increased rating from 1* to 3*. FB's ludicrous labyrinth of permissions/assets across Bus Mgr/Meta Suite and transition of permissions to the latter may be partly the reason for my problems but that is no excuse for an absence of useful Wix support and a catch all message indicating breach of FB advertising standards. ( wasted many hours adjusting and resubmitting campaigns to no avail ) I'll try the next few campaigns directly with FB  to make sure that all permissions/assets are correctly set up. May resume ads via WIX if that settles down.Hope this review helps anyone else out there having similar problems. Basically, if you get a Wix ad error saying the campaign was stopped for breaching FB advertising standards, it's quite likely that your problems are nothing to do with advertising standards. Far more likely to be a problem with asset/page/ad/catalog within FB Bus Mgr v FB Meta Bus Suite."

And my client no longer receives any regular enquiries like before, its probably lost him a lot of custom and he regrets leaving WordPress, and he wants to migrate back to the said platform understandably.I asked an independent web-developer to examine the back-end of my website and they noticed Wix websites are missing much of the crucial code in the back-end for Google to effectively index and crawl your website. When seeing how slow images load on my Wix website, its no surprise Google probably ranks it lower as well. And for the avoidance of doubt we completed the Wix SEO checklist and set-up Google search console and analytics.The technology stack on WordPress seems to be much more Google friendly being its an open-source CMS platform, however the downside being its not as straight-forward to use as Wix, however my client has no choice but to return to WordPress given Wix failed to rank his website in Google and he has virtually zero-traffic going to his website compared to his previous website on WordPress.To put it simply, Wix is much easier for building websites because of its intuitive interface and its drag-n-drop style ***however*** the trade-off seems to be poor SEO, random formatting glitches and less-professional aesthetic compared to commercial websites. On a seperate note, Wix does seem to have good website security which is something."

In my case the subscription was also taken from my account without any notification before or after.  Following an adverse review Wix acknowledged this was as error and made a refund.  So, it is good to see they take reviews seriously.  However, more could be done to ensure the renewal process is completely transparent by making the auto-renewal setting visible."

I cannot find any way of contacting other than the \u2018chat\u2019 website which has failed to resolve the issue. To summarise:  On Tuesday I transferred my domain name, from another company to Wix. I then paid 3 year\u2019s premium service. (I have an existing premium account with Wix for another website I own).I began building my new website for the transferred old domain. In the process of trying to save & link my new website,  I discovered the premium service had not been allocated (via 3 \u2018chats\u2019) even though the money was taken and I received a confirmation email.I have had no business website or email since Tuesday. This is potentially damaging to me financially & professionally. I am freelance and rely on the site & its impact on the recent advertising campaign I have launched to recruit new students who now cannot contact me.Wix have taken my money & not provided the service. I have waited the 24-48 hours as requested, and still nothing. I\u2019m concerned that I have transferred the name now so I\u2019m stuck with Wix. Please can we sort this today?  Please provide a direct contact rather than \u2018chat\u2019 as this does not work. Thank you very much.Post this review: Wix did contact & sort it - fingers crossed it\u2019s all fine now. Thanks Wix."

I give Wix 4 stars for its platform , fix the editing and removal of comments and you will get 5 stars As for customer service in Claire's case 5 stars , if the rest of Wix callback team get up to that level of simplicity it would be good .

If you are considering opting for this package, I would encourage you to look elsewhere."

          "Contenu": "Overall, works well and is fairly intuitive to build. During the 'go live' phase, unlike some reviewers, I found the customer service to be helpful and efficient. However, my one gripe - and it is a major one - is Wix Payments. Following a transaction, it takes 8 days to get an acknowledgment and then many more before the payment actually reaches your bank account. Where an organisation is dependent on cashflow for survival, this could make the difference between survival and failure. A second, smaller issue, is that the fulfilment apps are mainly geared to North America and don't work in the UK. Come on Wix....if you want to achieve word of mouth recommendation, you need to get your customers to like and respect you - not be irritated by you for hanging onto their money!"

It seems like they are now aware of the problems many people are having and making an effort to fix their customer service, so I'll give them that.My subscription for a domain was due to renew at the end of this month. WIX already took my money in September BEFORE THE ACTUAL RENEWAL DATE. I talked to a customer service representative who told me that it would be fine but it immediately got denied. They are saying one thing on the phone, and a completely different thing on emails? Trust and accountability are important for customers to continue using a platform and Wix has potential, but they've completely ruined it with their fraudulent practices.I strongly discourage anyone from using this site and avoid it at all costs."

They have refused to pay me my money going on 6 weeks with NO end in sight! This isn't just a hundred bucks, it's 11 thousand dollars. I have bills to pay/contractors to pay! Like 2020 wasn't hard enough. Now I get to hire an attorney to try to get my OWN money back. DO NOT USE THEM! This is the most aggravating experience but there are other blunders that they've performed. My loss from damages to them is estimated around 16k in one year."

Similarly, if you are using the blog function on wix, expect the page to take an absolute age to load. I have also found some of the simple add on modules do not work either. The cookies / privacy pop up actually imprinted a piece of text in the middle of my site and popped up on every page, regardless of how many times i clicked to exit.

I get my hosting for free, which is probably a good idea given the large number of complaints from people paying money for plans that are worthless.  To sum it all up Wix really is great as long as you don't pay for one of their premium plans and figure out how to get adequate image viewing quality."

They were very helpful, told me how to check for blocked/safe senders, and said they did not block Wix.Wix seemed to have given up. I chased them this week, and got the same old story that Outlook was blocking the emails. Really? Why would they suddenly start doing that?

I am now out of pocket by nearly \u00a3200 for a product I do not want.  Unfathomable that they are happy to behave in such a way.  In addition, I've found the customer service to be dreadful.  Either don't reply or when they do they avoid the specific questions asked.  Never the same representative.

Take your money elsewhere people as there are many other websites that offer a much better experience than these jokers. Disgusted with them and advise anyone to steer clear of them.UPDATE:Wix customer services did get back to me although it was over 16 hours later but once they had gotten back to me they were friendly and dealt with my problem in a timely manner and everything was resolved to my satisfaction hence why I have upgraded them from a 1 star to a 3 star."

Wix Customer service was absolutely wonderful to work with. I typically am not a fan of the bots but the questions are better targeted and allow you to actually get what you need-whether that be a person or a resource. That said Wix is a 4.5/5 for me. I also build on Squarespace and it has some more modern feeling features and interface capacities that I enjoy more. Plus desktop to mobile view is MUCHHHHHH easier to manage there than here on Wix. That's probably my only complaint for Wix. Other than that, I would really recommend it to anyone to have a solid website."

Too many online companies are unidirectional in their communication - it's easy to get the money in, not so easy to get the solutions out, too much reliance on FAQ pages and too few humans.Having said that. I am enjoying putting together my WIX page, it's fit for purpose, but can I advise this international and obviously very successful company to put a big ass CONTACT US button top right personed by carbon based units?"

I ended up writing to them on twitter, not my first choice when it comes to contacting customer support (that is email without having to go through lots of bot questions and the support page)Update: Updating the review regarding support, today I could actually talk to a person through the chat (this weekend I only had the option of a call) and the agent helped me quickly. There seems to be some bugs in wix that could occur but hopefully the agent will forward the issue to the relevant department and it could be sorted there. Leaving it at 4 stars now because I've encountered some bugs while working but other than that I am very happy."

Wix does not seem to have the same bells and whistles and it to be honest looks a lot of hard work when compared to the other place which looks like you just set up a store and POOF !!! you make a load of money . Well, you don't , I came back to Wix as it is a more justifiable price and started the hard work , going through the many many steps , its hard , disciplined WORK in comparison to the other place BUT by the end of the day my stuff was already showing in search engines !!!

I spent DAYS working on a website, no where near to completion. I had many problems, one of which was a problem with the menu, the pages were not popping up even though I knew they were linked. After tirelessly googling and looking for help on Youtube, I tried turning to chat support for help. Apparently you have to pay extra for chat support, instead I was directed to email my questions, in which I never heard anything. Before I canceled my plan, I went on Wix.com to test out the free version to compare. It took me only a COUPLE HOURS to make a complete website with Wix.com whereas it took me SEVERAL DAYS to make part of a website on Wordpress.com. In summary, Wordpress.com drove me crazy. Skip the headache, jump to Wix.com instead."

I was very happy with my Wix website, so it's incomprehensible that it's this hard to retrieve my data, and there's absolutely no way to reach an actual human being.UPDATE: March 31 - the response from Wix, at this point, is about what I expected. They sent me a link to the same pointless process on their website that I can't access!UPDATE: April 13 - Immediately after venting on Trustpilot, I was contacted by Wix customer support. With their help, I was able to successfully reactivate my lapsed account. They also asked for more details about my frustrating experience so they could consider others in my predicament in the future. Thanks, Wix!"

          "Contenu": "I purchased a 3 year year plan on 25th April after hearing positive review of Wix. Designed my website but the mobile version rearranges the sections so that it is no longer usable. This includes sections being out of order and even overlapping. I tried to rearrange the sections using the up/down arrows to the right and even tried rebuilding the whole website, but I was unable to fix this issue so decided to cut my losses.On 16th May I moved to Weebly instead and requested a refund from Wix.  As I was 1 week over their 14 day money back guarantee I was happy to pay for the remainder of the year, but asked for a refund of the following 2 years.  This was denied.26th May 2023 - An updateThe day after my review I was contacted by Liza from the Wix support team who has been a great example of good customer support (helpful, keen to understand the problem, fast with her responses).We discussed the issues and agreed that while with more time & support the mobile site could have been modified as I wanted it to, she understood why I left the platform and requested a refund.  This refund was given in full for the whole 3 years.To summarise:- Now a 4 star rating (was 1) as their customer serivce has been very good.  If you are experiencing an issue as a Wix customer, I would highly recommend talking to them directly. - Desktop to mobile conversion was not good with the template I used.  Be cautious especially if you have a time limit."

Being something of a technophobe it took me a while to work out how to use it as the tutorials are prepared on the assumption that all their users are tech experts, but it's pretty simple really, everything being based on editable text boxes and you can choose a variety of backgrounds and formats, or design your own. They have made it more difficult these days to actually speak to a human being when things go wrong but when you do get to speak to them they are very helpful. Any issues I've had have been resolved right away. I only use a fraction of the facilities the site provides since I'm not a business selling anything, but I'm very happy with them and will only change if they should suddenly decide to make paying to use Wix mandatory."

WIX literally takes you by the hand and makes setting up and running a web site easy and practical. I have a premium plan, and their customer service is amazing so far. My final star will be given to you guys if you add some necessary features in your web sites such as the following: 1) ability to freeze an element wherever you want but mainly on the side of a blog, so that the user can still see this element as he/she scrolls down.2) A format tool (format brush) like the one it exists in Word with which you can simply copy the format style from one place to another inside the text of the blog. Currently, you can only choose your format by a drop down menu which is harder and less practical."
