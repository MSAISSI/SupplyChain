          "Contenu": "After the most recent upgrade, I was attempting to submit a claim and kept being redirected to an error page. The system would not let me scrub the claim to identify a possible fix but rather sent me straight to an error \"oops\" page and directed me to fill out an ticket. When I did so, the person that was assigned to assist me told me there was a missing zip code. I was able to correct the issue and submit the claim but when I explained that generally the scrub function would identify missing information I received a very curt reply from Tammy L that said \"The error said the zip code was missing\". It did NOT say that on my end and that was what I was trying to explain. It USED to allow me to scrub a claim and let me correct any errors. Since the upgrade, this is no longer a function I have and may likely be a glitch that happened during upgrade. I did not appreciate the response. It was not helpful and was rude, in my opinion. Unfortunately, this has become the norm when asking for assistance. The launch of 2.0 appears to be \"make upgrades and figure out eh glitches as we go\". I don't have the time to work through the building of a system while trying to put my efforts towards running a practice. The system is not inclusive. My partner is visually impaired and many of the features are not accommodating to her needs. Technical support does a poor job of listening to the issues and attempting to resolve them. There are many other systems to utilize besides Therapy Appointment and if this is the attitude of customer service, I am seriously considering looking at other options."

          "Contenu": "I am in the process of deleting my account after an appalling experience with their billing support team. I have been a customer since May 2020 and everything was going okay until I faced a significant technical issue that I needed help with involving posting claims. I voiced my frustration with my experience and my desire to leave as a result. The billing supervisor Instead the first thing she said when she called was \"do you want to start with X issue or X issues\". She failed to inquire as to why I was wanting to cancel my subscription or to show any empathy about the poor experience I was clearly having with the service. In my initial shock, I said I just wanted to leave the service and she proceeded to cheerily say an email would be sent to me to show me how to do that. When I asked why she was making no attempt to keep me as a customer or better understand the ways in which TA support could have improved, she said she had and the conversation was \"not going anywhere\". When I expressed my desire to speak to someone in a higher position she said TA didn't give out upper management's phone number for random phone calls. Really disappointed as I loved the interface but couldn't get past this truly shocking support experience. Stay away- it's not worth it if you work on your own and needed personalized help with technical billing questions."

          "Contenu": "For a single Dr practice with only one administrative employee this program is very difficult. Making appts is awful as we sometimes make anywhere from 2 to 6 months of appts at a time.  The calendar for the month doesn't have blanks like the old system where you can put the appts in there.  You have to go to the small calendar and each time you say \"book it\" it takes you clear back and you have to start over from the beginning of the year to get back to the month you were on.  Very time consuming if the patient is patiently waiting at your desk.  If you are the one person doing everything and your on one task, say posting checks. Its much more time consuming to get it done quickly and get out of where your at, save it,  and help the person on the phone. I don't know how many times I've had to stop completely where I'm at because it's too hard to get to the calendar from billing, or just put a persons info in with their last name to pull up their account.  So I have to leave where I'm at and then start over when I'm done with the phone.  This program is just too busy, Legacy would have been better with just a few improvements to upgrade some of the things it needed instead of the whole thing being completely redone.  The electronic billing has some better features. For instance you can edit the 1500 page if your not sure you used the correct CPT code and you can correct or void the claim right there before you submit them.  We like the fact you can look on the calendar and find the canceled patients by checking the cancelation box,  as all canceled appts will show up in red. These are some of the improvements that would have worked with Legacy.  We'll keep using this for now, but it is what it is.  Thank you Jill"

This should be automatically saved and recorded.  When filling in an EOB, the client payment, the page shows \"0\" even though there is one.  Additionally, sometimes a client's claim will submit when I complete the note, then later I see that a claim for the same client was not submitted, even though I cannot see there was a problem with it.

Also, I was confused by the \"exceptions.\" I assumed this would be for making exceptions to the schedule--for example if I were out of town on a particular week. Obviously, this was not correct as I ended up with an unexpected result. Setting up a schedule, or editing a schedule, could be improved by making it possible to input the information using the keyboard--not only by dragging/resizing. If it can already do this, that is not obvious or easy to figure out how."

TherapyNotes gives her the option to update the benefits info once an ERA is received. For example, if the initial info is that a client had a $20 copay however, when the ERA is received it shows the client's responsibility is $60, TherapyNotes will ask if the clinician would like for the benefits to be updated. Personally, I think this is a game changer. I was wondering why she never complains about her billing anymore. I spend a lot of time asking my billing team to make sure an update the benefits once the ERA is received. I think TA is doing some things better than TherapyNotes ie) charging the credit card automatically once the note is signed."

There was a bit of a learning curve in the first couple of months, and getting started required (in my case at least) the creation of numerous intake documents that could be a bit tedious to draft. Still, the platform helped me take my practice to a new level, and it has become a much better system than my previous method of doing everything in house with no third party paperwork management system. One thing I appreciate about the platform is that it continues to evolve and get better as time goes on. There are still a few things I\u2019d like to see improve (read receipts for sent messages are one small but obvious feature that is still missing; the ability for clients to schedule their own group appointments for couples counseling rather than limiting client scheduling to their personal solo sessions is another). Still, the platform has seen numerous upgrades in the year I\u2019ve been using it, and I imagine it will continue to get better with time."

Since being on 2.0 there are many updated features of which the one I use most is the built in virtual session option.  That said navigating some of the business, billing, and insurance needs we have in 2.0 has been challenging.  The reason for the high rating is the consistent tech and teaching support we get from the people.  The turn around time is fair and the zoom or phone calls are very helpful.  If someone like me can use TA everyone can.  For those of you who are more tech savvy I am sure you will love all that you can do within the program."

Credit card processing has been great, our office manager has found it a good product now that everything is set up.  It was a long process to get everything set up, but now that we're there, it's pretty seamless.  We have custom documentation so that we don't have to write much on our notes because things auto populate for us now that we have set it up.  We use the telehealth platform which works well for us.  We like that some of us can use on-line scheduling to varying degrees and that's an example of how it has been customizable to each clinician. The little things which aren't ideal have been more minor than what we ran into for theranest, therapynotes, and simple practice."

That was amazing and I felt like I was heard. It's very rare I have any issues or downtime. I never need to use tech support because it's easy to use and doesn't have any issues. My clients also report that it's easy to use on their end for appointments. There are still a few little tweaks I wouldn't mind they add (I wish receipts could be emailed instead of print only. I also wish documents could be edited so that a therapist and client can both sign instead of the document being closed once a client submits. I wish Zoom offered a few more features such as a custom message for your waiting room. I also wish there was an easier way to send progress notes to client) but these are more Quality of Life upgrades that would really enhance the experience. Overall, a great platform and much easier to use compared to others I sampled before I chose."

Notwithstanding, I do have a few wishes. 1) I wish there was greater phone access when there is a question. Being referred to prompts and volumes of troubleshooting articles is not helpful. 2) I wish the system would allow you to correct errors in the notes found after it is locked. If we catch an error in a handwritten copy, we can correct it. Our signature is testimony to the integrity of the note. Why shouldn't we be able to correct it here? Couldn't we add a heading indicating it is a polished copy while leaving the first draft to preserve and prove the integrity of the content? That way, we can improve the punctuation, word omissions, grammar, name errors, etc., that 3rd party payors are adept at pointing out. 3) I wish there was a way to enter treatment plans that were in use and completed before being entered into the system, and 4) that there would be a second page for additional goals and objectives so immediate and short-term ones can be added. I hope this was helpful and not taken as being overly critical."
