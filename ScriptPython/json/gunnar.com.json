I trust this company because I can see only these glasses reflect so much blue light.The first eyeglasses I bought more than a year ago and I had no single issue with it. The one star is for not perfect company's business processes: 1) I received my eyeglasses today with the AMBER 75% blocking blue light lenses, but I ordered AMBER MAX 98%. 2) In order tracking I was asked to upload three photos for PD, which was not necessary in the end."

However, when I tried to use the code\u2026 the system would NOT recognize the code. I tried multiple times with no success. After I moved forward with the order, I wrote an email to GUNNAR Support. At this time, I have not received a response. My email stated the following:\u201cGUNNAR Rep - I am wringing because I tried to use the code listed in the Welcome email below but the system/website would not recognize the code listed below (WELCOME20NP). I did process my order since I did not want to miss the purchase of there 2 glasses I'd like to request help with using this % off code. Thank you,.: DF \u201dI would love to hear how I can be reimbursed for the system not recognizing the code GUNNAR sent me. I feel this is false advertising to lure customers to your website by providing a discount code and then forcing them to pay full price."

It's not a look I enjoy, so I'll only be wearing these glasses when I'm not on camera or out in public. Very disappointing."

I got an invoice from FedEx with import duties of 25% AND 15% administration fee AND around 5% tax on the fee. This is just genius considering there was NO VISIBLE information on Gunner's website about any processing or import fees, even after I have specified the shipping address to be the EU.

At least offer non-prescription natural focus lenses to fit all your frames. Offering all lens tints for all your frames would make a lot of sense too.

Instead of the cart saying \"Hey, your price is double what you're expecting\" you find out later when you're putting in your payment options. Granted, the two frames in the cart was my fault, but the price said $250 (which was the starting price of the frames I chose) regardless. Also, a little more clarity on how long an order takes to be shipped would be great. I'm thinking 7-10 business days, but in reality it could take up to three weeks for your order to be processed and ready for shipping. Upon writing this review, I have not received my glasses, so I can't really speak much on the product itself, but I'm expecting those to come in tomorrow, after nearly a month after ordering them."

          "Contenu": "You want honest comments here you go.  The coupon for the back to school was done incorrectly.  It state ALL glasses site wide*.  Now with the asterisk there are exceptions but you can not find them anywhere, so I started to choose products that came up when I selected the coupon, the interceptor 2 pair, and the $25 mystery box.  When I applied the coupon it said it could not no problem be done.  I tried talking to a customer rep online and they stated that these products were promotional items.  I asked where did it say that say that these were not part of the deal and why did they pop up on page one, when you selected the coupon?  No answer.  I then sent an email to you customer service department, Kenny replied and stated that I was right, the asterisk should have been explained better and been easier to find.  He did give me a coupon to use so I could still get my items, so I am to upset with him just with how the sale was done.  Please in the future have a better explanation for asterisk items and do not include them when customers select the coupon.  This made it very confusing, thank you.Got a reply and they said they changed the site to make it easier to find the products not available on the coupon and it still does not show up anywhere I could find.  Also, the promotional item are still on the first page when you select the coupon, tell me how this is not confusing.  I bought your products, but this is way to confusing to your customers trying to use this coupon, sorry if I am an honest person trying to help."

          "Titre": "Odd to request a review before the purchase object arrives, but sure, I'll give it a shot.",
          "Contenu": "First time using this trustpilot site, but the wording seems to be to review the entire shopping experience rather than just the product itself. Sorry if this gets to be \"too\" detailed but I'd rather go through it to lay everything on the table rather than just state the highlights (such as extreme positives or negatives) and let people think those are the only things that happen.My experience with purchasing a Gunnar Optiks glasses involved first chatting via the \"contact us\" page, asking about the ability to remove the \"gunnar\" logo thats printed directly on the glass, and about which particular glass I might want. Removing the logo is a no go it seems, which is a bit disappointing but they did point me in the direction of what seems like the right glasses. Everything about this interaction was perfectly fine and I have no complaints. So, I actually went through Amazon to purchase the ones I wanted. Turns out some versions on Amazon are \"only X in stock\" including the one I purchased. Odd, but fine, it is right after the holidays after all. Only problem though, is that when the package arrived, I actually received the incorrect glasses. So, in requesting for a \"replacement\", I found out that apparently because Amazon shows it as low stock it can't be \"replaced\" it can only be \"refunded\" and with no way of communicating through Amazon to the seller (Gunnar I presume). I applied for a refund and had to send those other glasses back. Oh well. Annoying, more than anything.While I had those glasses I did get to test them out a little bit though, and I did like the concept from them. I did find out after receiving them that the pictures on Amazon and also on Gunnar's own website contain images that have versions of the glasses that have no \"made in China\" sticker/tag on them, which was interesting to see is on the actual glasses. Felt like an attempt to hide where the glasses were made from unless someone particularly searched for the information which is admittedly available on Amazon if I'd looked, but I didn't see it anywhere on Gunnar's site after looking. Probably tucked away somewhere. A little shady, but at this point, who isn't selling items from China and trying to making it seem like they are local, am I right?I did decide to purchase the glasses I \"actually\" wanted through Gunnar's website instead of hoping it doesn't get screwed up from/through Amazon again. I had made a cart and purchased it essentially immediately, but I did end up hitting a seeming bug in how the website works; the website probably wouldn't have known my email address if I hadn't purchased, but I was pinged a few times in my email about \"items in my cart\" over the next few days. Nothing too untoward, but an issue to point out.And obviously, as the title states, the review was sent to me before the item even arrived, despite it being tracked.Overall, I think a 3 star review is a bit of a \"harsh\" choice, but apt. Nothing was particularly \"bad\", just a bit awkward because of the number of little things that had added up over the process.Edit in response to the reply: The email bringing me to the \"review\" only stated that it was in response to my \"Shopping Experience\" so it can obviously be very hard to tell which particular \"experience\" is intended to be reviewed. Someone might want to make it more explicitly clear what the intent of the review is supposed to be if it is supposed to be about one specific event."

Pin hole size but they're definitely there at times and I don't understand that. That is why I'm giving it rating of 3 stars"

Early black Friday deals specifically. Now, I paid full price for my glasses. I'm not a baby. I know sometimes sales happen after you place an order. The company doesn't owe me any kind of sale price on my purchase or anything. It was bad luck.Did they have to bombard me with email, after email, after email regarding these sale prices and offers on new pairs of glasses when I didn't even have the glasses I ordered in hand yet?!

I feel the difference, it is much easier to look at my screens in the glasses even though I set the nightshift warmth mode. I will keep using them. After I placed the order, I kept browsing the site and, out of blue, I received a pop-up message offering a discount if I subscribe to Gunnar's. I wish I could get that discount notification before submitting my order. Keep an eye on such a discount ;)"

My eyes don't dry out, my screens don't irritate my eyes like they used to, and the transition aspect is a huge help outside. I bought the clear lenses with sunglasses transition. The lenses do have a slight amber tint, but that was to be expected. The transitions will take about 5 mins to full darken and between 5 and 10 mins to lighten back up. Overall I love them. I do wish they didn't have the logo on the lens but it isn't in the way of my view so no too much of an issue there."

Like, so easily that all I have to do is blink to make a smudge. Luckily this pair came with the cleaning solution and lens cloth as part of the holiday pack, but it can get annoying to constantly take my glasses off to clean smudges off."

Bc of that I do get some minor pain and cant wear them for more than a couple hours, so I only wear them for a couple hours before bed.With that out of the way, I really do like these glasses.  They have definitely helped with night time eye strain, and they have helped me with falling asleep.  Plus I think they kinda look hot on me.  That being said I like them, but your mileage may vary."
