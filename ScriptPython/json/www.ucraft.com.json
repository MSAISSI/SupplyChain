No grace period, no backup, no notification (and claim they cannot prove they notified me as their email are deleted after a couple months... seriously, as a website hosting company how little space do they have for near-blank emails?!?!). I was also not notified of the domain being disconnected for free users. The staff helped me somewhat fix a couple of design bugs in the website, but that's worth nothing if it all goes out the window. They obviously have a big problem with their notification emails not going out and until they deny this they won't fix it. So, if you're a free user with a little website that may not generate much traffic, BACKUP BACKUP BACKUP (or just go elsewhere really...)."

Any SEO tactic will not improve ranking of page created on Ucraft. 4 days I cannot get reply to my request to cancel subscription and return my money back because reply from support means that they are not able to fix their bug. As a conclusion. Sooner I tested several pages created on different platforms: WooCommerce, Shopify and Squarespace. Ranking of pages in the same Google tool gave me from 70 to 95 for mobile and from 90 to 99 for desktop. It is better to invest more and do not have a headache with SEO. Unfortunately, I cannot reply but just put it here: you have deleted all my data without any notice. Well done :(. And after that you notify me about the fact of refund. Anyway, hope my case will be helpful for your new customers from any sense."

          "Contenu": "Terrible website builder! The free templates are EXTREMELY limited: you can only change the text and the images, nothing else. Any other changes, you must upgrade to a paid plan. I then decided to sign up for the free 14-day trial, thinking that if I liked it I would opt for a paid plan, but still ran into issues: the interface is not very intuitive, despite I've built many drag-and-drop websites both personally and professionally (Weebly, Wix, Squarespace), and the controls are very limited. For instance, you cannot change the placement of the site title in the page header: it's either top of page, centered, or bottom of page. I had an image with mountains and needed to slightly adjust the placement but couldn't. Also, I wanted to use a video header, and the interface asked for a \"mobile image\" (since video headers don't work on mobile). Ok, so I uploaded one...and the still image is what came up first on my DESKTOP site, THEN switched to the video header. NOT the effect I wanted! There was no control anywhere to fix this.Overall, I wasted an entire six hours or more trying to get this site to work, until I finally gave up and went back to Wix. At least Wix has plenty of user controls that work properly and an interface that lets you accomplish what you need to do. Never again, Ucraft."

After a few days, you ask for a status, 'How's it going with the technical support?', they send an email and you wait for days just for a status. Is this going to take a few minutes or days? When will this be fixed? You don't know and you're stuck waiting.In the end, you skip the features you paid for, don't wait for the tech support and just find a way around it, which makes you work twice as hard.Why? Because you wanted the advanced elements, read their posts on it and followed the steps as mentionned, but........ there was a glitch. And their tech support can't keep up so the advanced features are useless.Basically, if you can fend on your own, you'll be ok. Be ready to start things over just to work around their glitches. You'll manage if stuck ucraft but it is not a refreshing and satisfying experience."

          "Contenu": "Summary: As each of my Ucraft sites expanded from 5 pages to 20+, I realize that I should have chosen a platform, like Duda, that prioritizes page speed.________________________________________________I went on a Ucraft bender for a while, building out beautifully designed web pages for my clients, including:\u2022 garygermer.com\u2022 manceps.com\u2022 solomon.org\u2022 bonniebostrom.com\u2022\u00a0try.easy2hike.com* meritbadgemarketing.comWhy I'm Happy:1. Customer service is hyper-fast and available via chat on every web page.2. Templates are very well designed and with a little ingenuity, you can do most things without much effort.3. Icons are a breeze and their built-in app means you can choose icons right on the page, without having to find them on a different website and upload them manually.4. SEO is a breeze, allowing you to configure Title, Description, and Social Media Share Images with ease.5. Domain mapping and SSL is also effortless.6. Buttons are easy to customize.Why I'm Not Happy:1. My greatest complaint is that my websites are dreadfully slow. On google page insights (with tracking tags installed), my sites typically come in at less than 20/100 \u2014\u00a0waaayy slower than Wix or Duda.This, alone, is a major dealbreaker for me and as I build out more and more pages on each of the ucraft sites I manage, I *really* regret choosing this platform.I have been in multiple conversations with the Ucraft folks about specific suggestions they can roll-out to improve the site speeds of their templates but they don't seem to be making page speed a priority.2. As my sites have become more complex, the web design app has become increasingly unstable. It is a rare day that I can get through a design session without getting an \"internal server error\" and have to reload the page. Sometimes the design window is so buggy, it takes minutes to drag one thing to another part of the page.3. The blogging app is dramatically bad. You can embed youtube videos but not other types of content like Twitter posts. Also, there is no rss feed associated with your blog, which makes it difficult for your followers to subscribe to your content (and/or for you to automatically aggregate posts to your other channels).4. No ability to customize CSS Or HTML for those with more advanced web design abilities.5. Ucraft provides free in-app access to creative commons photos. However, the photos go into your site at full-resolution, which means they bloat your webpages and you shouldn't really use them."

I am experienced in building\u00a0websites, having used many other builders (such as Wix, Squarespace, Weebly and so on).---+ PROS1) Creating a website on Ucraft is easy and very straight-forward.\u00a02) You do not need any experience in building websites in order to produce a professional website.3) Overall, Ucraft is able to produce modern and professional-looking websites, more so than a couple of other website builders which spring to mind.4) Quick on-site customer support. A message on the website states you'll get a reply to support requests in 5 minutes,\u00a0but I was waiting closer to over 20 minutes. Still can't really complain as most businesses take 2-3 working days usually.(Previously I Googled a contact method to get in touch with support and was redirected to an email address for Ucraft by the search engine. Don't do this - You need to use the on-site support feature, not any support email addresses you find via search engines).- Note that I am currently communicating with support regarding an issue which is mentioned in \"cons\" below. The review regarding support may be updated depending on how it goes ---------- CONS1)\u00a0 The images on the website all randomly broke within a week of the site being published. Which meant they all painstakingly had to be replaced. This has never happened on any other website builders I have used.2)\u00a0 Ucraft has recently changed the website's address from a .net domain to a .site domain as part of a recent upgrade to the service.* This change was timed extremely poorly. It was made during a period of lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic when the business was not operating.\u00a0* All of the company paperwork, stationery, vehicle\u00a0skins and so on may now have to be changed to reflect the change made to the website's address by Ucraft, which will cost quite a fair bit of money.* This change has also caused an ongoing drop in potential customers due to them not being able to find the company through its original .net web address.3) Though most of my queries were responded to regarding the above issue, support\u00a0did completely ignore\u00a0the fact that the (poorly-timed) above change to the website made by Ucraft is having a negative financial impact on the business and offered no apology nor rectification for this.--------CONCLUSION (so far)A website builder which is easy to use and appeals to both experienced as well as inexperienced website designers. Websites look very professional and modern.Very quick support response time - minutes instead of days (Wix's support team could learn a lot from this). However, so far, no apology or compassion (so far - support is still ongoing at the time of writing this) has been given regarding the fact that a poorly-timed Ucraft change has negatively impacted a small business.(This review and the star rating may change to reflect the conclusion of my ongoing discussions with support)."

My major issue is things not doing what they say they will, or freezing up and doing nothing t all. If you stick to the templates which ALL have way too much emphasis on Image and not much on substance ( ie a food site is different to a travel style blog site because of the layout not because of the pictures!  So give us variety in layouts! ) Initailly when I had problems and would ask for help via their chat box, all you get is someone telling you to refer to a list of \"how to\" videos, all a bit robotic. Oh Steve Jobs where are you? Please beam me up to the land of higher standards!!! But I continue on because I shall CONQUER, and I have faith - once I delete all the excess and keep it simple, I will have something honest and reflective of my business. With no help from Ucraft I must add."

If I pay for a service, I should be able to build 10% of a site, and finish it at my own time. I have considered switching to SquareSpace, I have trialled their product and it's flawless, beautifully designed pages relevant to industry types, and no loading issues! The plus with uCraft is the Dashboard, it's really easy to navigate & use. The positive is the drag & drop functions, however no space is left between blocks & elements when designing a webpage, meaning often I've had to battle to reposition by blocks/elements as they land in strange places when trying to move them, or they refuse to move to the area I want them to go, at times messing up a layout higher up on a web page.... I've been a bit frustrated with the whole experience.I hope this feedback can be taken positively however as I think the uCraft product has great potential, but more tech work needed to get things working 'smoothly'."

Some of the ways things work are not complete intuitive to me, but once I know the work around, I am generally able to accomplish what I set out to do.  I will say that their blog platform is pretty terrible.  All their handy page elements and customization goes out the window once you want to format a blog post.  All you are able to do is but a photo above and below a paragraph.  No image editing, no caption capability, no creative layout options.  I have suggested that they make some changes to this portion of their website creator, especially since a blog is an integral portion of any company's web presence and can help sell product (or chase people away).  The blog issue is truly something I hope they improve but the rest of the design process has been fairly pain-free.  I have been able to create a professional looking website with very minimal skills."

So your company has to remain stuck to Gmail, Yahoo or something of the sorts other than @yourcompany.PS. Thanks Ucraft, I like your quick response.

There are a couple of things that annoyed me a little bit and that is the rigidity of the templates, I simply wanted to move a few text boxes and this was not possible. Also, the platform freezes, a lot! I'll be working on something and it freezes, I refresh and have to work on another part of the website and come back to it later. Also the automatic save does not always save!! I ended up having to copy all my text into a word document just to make sure it wasn't lost. Overall I'm really happy.

It's intuitively easy to use and responsive.It's a bit off that more elements cannot be edited (such as adding blocks or moving things around in the existing template) but I guess it's their way of incentivizing people to upgrade.Their support staff is friendly and responds pretty much instantly.

If you can't pay that, then you need to rethink your need for a website. Either that, or you can afford to have an ugly subdomain URL because you're obviously not looking to represent your business.I've set up a full, (mostly) customizable website in UCraft for what is STILL more affordable than the other web hosting services (I'm literally paying half what I was with Weebly). The platform is very user friendly and I will definitely be reccommending it to my clients.The team are great, they've helped me with any issues I had regarding domain problems.The only problem I have is that even with design tools, not everything is completely customizable (eg. reducing white space around photos) but having dabbled in a little HTML, I can get around it.So seriously, great job.

The live chat button to talk to a live agent works perfectly, and they are on often enough the wait time is not very long. They give you options to achieve what you're trying to do with the free version, when possible, and talk about plan options without being pushy, and only in order to fulfil your needs. I definitely recommend giving them a try."

She is outstanding in her support. Not that the others I had interacted with. They were excellent in their support too, but Ashkhen was outstanding. She just knew how to engage and manage the situation I was faced with and knew how best to support me. I did not feel alone in this. She was there and that was really very reassuring for me."

Most of the Ucraft support people knew what to do immediately and they were very helpful. There's still a lot of room for improvement. I can't wait to have more apps integrated. It's easy enough for me to do everything on my own since I just started my online shop and I am glad I can have the freedom to design/make my website the way I want it to be. The major highlight was that I didn't have to buy expensive themes or need to know how to code - thus I was able to focus on selling my designs and accessories. It's easily integrated with social media platforms and quite easy to create blog posts. The E-commerce platform is also straightforward, has automatic customer/user e-mails, invoices, and I only pay the monthly subscription fee. No other hidden costs made it really helpful especially for people who are just starting a business.Things I'm having a hard time with are having a built-in pop-up, changing the photo size of the blog header, having a bi/multilingual store, difficulty in showing different price ranges when your variations have a different price, the comment box for blog posts are from another app and I haven't really made it show on any of my blog post pages.I have used Ucraft Pro Shop for almost two months now and so far I really like it. I started with a free trial on Pro Website."

          "Contenu": "When I tell you, I have been with the major players when it comes to buying URL, hosting, and all the extra charges, that keep popping up, from time to time over the years. When I made the switch over to Ucraft. At first, it was a bumpy road. Not for Ucraft, but the institutional ways I have been taught from buying url/domain, SSL certificate, hosting, Website tool builders, and the most important customer service.I was hard on them (Ucraft), at first, and they just took it. Ucraft customer service knew if they could please me, and my clients. And bring us back to having a company you can trust. And I trust Ucraft. The customer Service tells you a lot about Ucraft's management, and Owner.Ucraft customer service will never upsell you, send emails to buy other services. If you want something don't be afraid to ask. I love Ucraft! And You should too!Remember, their is no perfect hosting, website tool builder, and yes there are many hiccups in all operating systems, browsers, and the apparatus to which you are connecting to enter the World Wide Web.If something goes down, goes wrong, and it will. I promise You. But when things are back up running better ;than it did when the hiccups or interruptions happened.That's always a good thing! So, don't sweat the small stuff, be creative and use Ucraft. This could be a forever relationship."
