It's understandable that the original rest technicians on chat had extensive experience in dealing with situations as they worked closely with the technicians. But these days the only solution seems to be a callback. It's not service in real estate. It's poor time management. Some companies have trust account specialists that can sit by the phone all day waiting. Many smaller companies with skilled rest employees don't have time for pampered service. They need solutions. In chat. It's ok to say something is not possible. It's cumbersome to use follow up calls for to lack of knowledge in an attempt to resurrect the chat assistance rest was famous for. Ready is far superior to property tree. It's just that the chat customer service people really don't know the program anymore. Probably cause it's MRI not Rockend. Urging boss to dump MRI is rest is stopped. Property tree is no comparison to rest with someone that understands computers...."

God know when that will come!  Too many times we have contacted them for support and they don't know how to fix it or you wait so long for the return call you end up fixing it yourself.  they need to hire more support staff, get back to customers quicker or better yet deal with the issue and provide a resolution in the first call.  the product is ok for what it does, the company is terrible and the customer support is none-existent.  Also don't complain to your account manager as he just shrugs it off most of the time."

At this point we are just going to invoice them for the billing overcharges to see if that does anything to move the process along.Update: Even though MRI promised in their reply that they would have it resolved by the end of this week (1/21/2022) I have now been advised that \u201clegal is giving me pushback\u201d according to our account manager.

Being advised that the issue could be related to how a user tabs/uses the screens could be valid, however improvements to the stored proc to validate the entries being treated, and a try catch logic being introduced should go some way to preventing these incorrect entries, and reduce the workload that it creates me to correct the issue after the fact."

Back in 2019 we were looking for a software that would simplify and accommodate our accounting needs for on-line payments, credit card purchases, commercial management. During the evaluation period the sales representative (Blake Strozyk) indicated that all our needs would be met. And back then it made sense as we were buying a recent software and we had no reason to doubt what the software could offer us. When we went through the presentations of the software, it was very visually appealing and we liked the adaptability of the reporting.The software has not lived up to our expectations and we have been forced to adapt to it so far. We know that the software is adaptable as many reports have been developed for us by Saboy Solutions, but there are basic software components which should be inherent in the software which would be so fantastic.I have been in contact with our Canadian Representative Jayson Young in your British Columbia branch and have provided him with our wish list of what we would like to see in the software. Our requests are truly reasonable basic accounting needs which most accountants would like to have in the accounting software.I would welcome a constructive conversation to hopefully be able to implement some (if not all) of our recommendations.Sincere regards."

If you are going to put the contract in CTMe, it has to be user friendly like the real estate contracts. I will never use your MH Contract to B and S unless it is like the real estae contracts.Please note, that Damian Cox, lawyer, used my Mobile Home Contract to Buy and Sell which the Real Estate Commission used to prepare the Manufacture Home Contract to Buy and Sell.

It comes down to MRI not capturing all of the prerequisite information properly in the initial bid and legacy product review components. Still a 4 star because they have a good product, would have been 5 if the account manager was more available and helpful. They eventually made good on most issues. Due to this dragging over six weeks and the lack of correspondence from our main rep, I will stick with a 4 star review. It would be nice if MRI employees used phone numbers in their contact information but they do not so that they can stay semi-elusive."
