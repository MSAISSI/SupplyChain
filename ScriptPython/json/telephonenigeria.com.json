When using the app to send SMS texts, most never send, just deleted on from over a month ago yesterday that still said it was pending. Attempted to send text today, it is still saying pending, but I get charged for them just the same whether they send or not. Calls are a chance too....More times than not like this morning, it keeps telling me the line is busy and then hangs up. I see I got charged for a call at 3:56 am CDT, that I never was connected to anyone, it simply told me `the line is busy, goodbye' buf I got charged for it. Or the call cuts off in the middle of it and when I try to call back it says the phone is shutoff, when I know for a fact that their phone would not have been shutoff when we are trying to discuss something. I am in the process of trying to find a more reliable source for making my calls to Nigeria. For instance was asked to call my party back in a 1/2 hour and have not been able to get anything but a recording tellung me the line is busy, or goodbye. When I first started using the service it wasn't this bad, it seems to be getting worse instead of better as time goes on. Hopefully some changes will be made to improve this service so that the next time I can give a better review."

U can also top up nija cards from here which is good. Very clear and doesn't cut when talking. U can hide ur ID or make it seen when calling. App shows u minutes left. The app also has ur contacts so u dial directly from it. I am usually signed into the app so dial from there. It saves me having to type in access number and all that. With the app I call via Internet so whether free minutes or not, I call but with home broadband tho. If u use ur mobile broadband then u may be paying a lot on ur data."

To cap it all, maybe it is due to the system that is now being used by Telephone Nigeria, my caller ID does not show at the receiver's end unlike before, instead they reported seeing some Nigerian like number. The only reason I still use this service is because of the speed dial. I have over 90 names listed on speed dial which makes it easy to use, if not I would have dump this service for good long ago. I have not only being a user, but have introduced a few people to the service, if the service continues this way, I will have no choice than seek out alternative service even if not as easy to use as this."

Things have gone better in Nigeria since you last increased it\ud83d\udc81\u200d\u2640\ufe0f? 2ndly, when keepcalling tells u the person u r calling is not available, it's high time you guys built in a feature that will let people press #1 or #5 to follow on another call. Make it better! It doesn't have to remain the archaic way it is. Presently, you have to end the call and redial and start all over again. Come on people,  we r getting too digital a nation for this? Upgrade pls \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44. Make the calling experience more fun. When call cards are used to call, you can press like #5 to call another number without having to end the call. Besides, add more monthly packages and bring down the price. That's what we call looking after customers. You lot don't know how to look after customers. I've been with u guys for over 4yrs now or more, never received a dime, not a voucher, nothing. But look at \"Just Eat\", I joined them the other day and I've already received 2 discount vouchers! That's how to do it. That's how to encourage your customers to stay. Where u guys from again? \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0fReply to Telephonenigeria;Well thanks for getting back. I'm glad you guys are implementing no 2. It will make things a lot easier. And thanks for explaining the reason behind the price rates \ud83d\udc4d. I still think that people like me shld be celebrated and rewarded. It ain't easy ya know. I buy that 350mins twice in a month! So discount vouchers is very recommended. People do it. You do give discounts or whatever to people who wanna top up credit for people in Nigeria, why can't you do the same for monthly package buyers like me here?? Treat everybody equally! And one important thing I forgot to mention in my review, when people have leftover of minutes from their monthly package, allow these minutes to be carried over to next month. Why are you guys so mean? We paid for these minutes so let us carry it over! Since you can't offer discounts, let this be the only thing we enjoy. The point I'm trying to make is that if you guysdon't do these things, new companies with better offers spring up everyday and the moment we discover them, we'll be gone. So if you're not doing anything to \"retain\" your customers, well, what can I say \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f? Good luck with it."
