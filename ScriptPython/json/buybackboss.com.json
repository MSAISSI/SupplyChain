          "Contenu": "They of course had the highest price for my Iphone 14 Pro and my wife's Iphone 14.  I sent them both phones separately in the original box.  I had my phone in a case for the entire year I had and also my wife's.  We also had screen protectors on and they were removed when I sent both in.  They were in excellent condition. Original offer was $567 - When they received, the offer went to $32 because of deep scratches on body of phone and screen?  They sent me pictures and the pictures showed a phone that was probably 5 years old or more?  When I complained, they upped the offer to $426.   Then when my wife's phone showed up, the original amount was $357 and they offered $239 because of Deep scratched on the screen???I told them to send back.  When I got them back, I examined them and both phones had zero damage or scratches on the bodies and mine had a minor 1/4 inch scratch that was not there when I sent in.  This company is definitely a bait and switch company that takes advantage of people by not giving them what they quoted on new phones.  Most of the positive reviews were on older phone.   Doing business with them is a valuable waste of time."

Already this is \"too good to be true\" but I decided to give them a shot based on good reviews online.When they received the phone, they tell me something is hazy in the front facing camera (there has never been an issue I noticed using any of my cameras), and now are quoting me $172. Complete BS. I request the phone to be sent back to me, now worried they are scammy and may not even send the phone back. I said no. They say wait now we'll offer $258 to \"save me the time\" of shipping back. Scammy.I said no, give me my phone back. They come back with a $310. Now I'm really worried they're not going to send my phone back.I said no, they eventually send it back, and I proceed to trade it into Apple for $500+. Complete waste of me time dealing with this company, super scammy feeling."

Phone was completely paid for 6 months ago. The only thing wasbrhe screen had been changed by Apple. Because of that you stated it wasn't flawless, yet it was completely free from visual defects or scratches of any kind. Your company is a scam artist and sellers beware, they will rip you off. If my product wasn't up to par, why did you eventually raise your offer oeivecto avoid returning it after I refused twice????? Liars and scam artists to the fullest. Hopefully others will see this and run far away."

I then offered to come down to $240 final offer. If they didn't accept I'd just like my phone back. They sent me my phone and I traded it in to Samsung for $315 on a new phone. Which is what I was going to do with the money anyways. It pays to shop around. Buyback Boss is betting on you taking what you they offer and not going through the hassle of waiting for the return and selling it someplace else. This business model counts on you being desperate for cash or too lazy to shop around someplace else. \"Just take what the Boss is offering peasant. Your lucky to be getting that much.\""

          "Contenu": "I sent in my iPhone 15 Pro Max, which they quoted online as $757 for Good condition. My phone had spent its entire life in a case and the battery health was at 90%. I took pictures before sending it in and wrapped it up securely in the manufacturers box. A week after the phone had been delivered I reached out as I had not heard anything. They stated that it had arrived and that they would inspect the phone within 10 business days of delivery. 11 business days go by and I don't hear anything so I reach out again. They respond that they need my IMEI number because they can't find my phone. After providing, they said they found it and will have it inspected right away. Another 2 days go by and I don't hear anything. I reach out again and am told someone will reach out with my estimate. I then receive an email that my phone has heavy scratching on the screen and they are reducing the offer to $455 ($300 less than original quote). They provided no pictures of the scratching in their first email. I respond back with pictures of the phone clearly showing that no scratches were present the day the phone was sent out. I tell them to send me my phone back. Another 2 days goes by and someone from another company, GadgetGone, responds back and now offers $520. In this email they do provide pictures of the phone. They claim they did not scratch my phone purposely to reduce the payout. I request my phone back. I believe that both Buyback Boss and GadgetGone are quoting high payouts but as soon as you send it to them, they offer significantly lower payouts. Additionally, since phone value is highest right before or after a new iPhone has been released their slow response times and losing my device reduced its value. I am waiting for my phone to be shipped back to me so I can inspect it and consider what action to take next. Luckily I documented my phone's condition with a lot of pictures before sending it to them."

Well, they had offered $144, but when they sent me what they thought it was worth, they said $38. I told them to send me my phone back. They responded by telling me that you could pull the glass screen away from the phone as it was supposedly cracked there. They even sent me a picture of the damage on the phone. The phone had NO damage before I sent it to them. They then told me they could offer $58. I told them to return the phone to me AND if my phone is damaged, I will add more to this Review for their abhorrent behavior. BE AWARE! These people WILL RIP YOU OFF! NEVER USE THEM!!

          "Contenu": "I will start with what I expected, had just traded the same phone Samsung note 20 ultra 5g) in the same condition to T mobile for 800 (added a line to my account) took less than 10 minutes to clear data and unlock!  Saw their ad on sell your sell, advertised same or next day on payment....I had downgraded the phone to good (always in a case and screen protector) Sent phone in on Aug 8th the same day I received authorization to send it in and secure the \"offer\" . I had sent in the original box, charger and cord.   I received a couple of emails checking to see if everything was accomplished and ask if any questions. Everything seemed fine and very positive....expected the same experience trading the phone in....even followed mobile instructions on erasing the phone. First issue (after phone was sent) discovered (from reviews) they throw away everything but the phone on receipt.... It wasn't theirs to show away! They didn't buy it ....what is the term or word for taking someones possessions without compensation? I can think of a lot but stole comes to mind.... I had a pristine phone with box, instructions, charger and cord....reminds me of a Pink Panther movie , Peter Seller wrecks a piano and they say \"this was a priceless Steinway .... he responds ...not anymore! \" I then get an email saying they (buyback) will get around to it in a week or so (so much for same day) Also responded elsewhere they don't have room to store boxes Maybe buy a bigger van to work out of? They had NO RIGHT to throw away something they didn't own (that now I have to buy to sell the phone) thieves or incompetence ? I finally get a reply saying the phone was locked because of iCloud or google or Samsung .... The phone was not on any such plans and gave them the screen lock code (but have no idea why)  They offered me $0000 and ask if the should recycle it (a phone that T mobile gave $800 for on trade in)  Just got the phone back, bought the stolen parts, charged it up and works perfectly after initialization setup procedures ....I didn't need the screen passcode or my social security numbers the ask for ?????? What I did find is my phone is worth a lot less now than several weeks ago and buyback no long seems to give any value on my phone.  The only thing I can conclude is they decided to no longer buy this phone (Samsung note 20 5 g) and this was an easier way for them to not pay.... I don't believe they are at all honest or a reliable \"company\" and they owe me for stealing not to mention the inconvenience I Read their reply , in response they did ask for my ssn# at the same time they wanted my screen pin. The last 4 digits of an ssn# can be just as damaging and when they say they didn't ask its a lie. Two points , the fact that they destroy charger, box and cord should be on the same initial instruction page not after the device was sent according to instructions for shipment (device was already gone and after a check up email not much later) Also when I checked on sell your cell to find another buyer it stated buyback wouldn't purchase this phone (maybe correcting their original statement that they advertised ...Same Day...) and lastly the stinking phone was not locked when I sent it and when it was returned ....I charged it (again after having purchased what they stole ) it fired up without any screen passwords ...ssn # ...all my data was gone. So \"locked \" is a lie... This is not a company to do business with...if they had any integrity they would have apologized , acknowledged and offered to pay for what they stole instead of excuses ."

I told them that I had been offered more from three different places but stayed with them because of my word, my friends referral and their guarantee. They didn\u2019t care about that just like they didn\u2019t care about me. So now my option is send it back across the country and start over. Such a giant waste of time. It sounds like people have had great experiences on here and I wish I could say the same but feels more like a bait and switch with my time and their postage costs being held hostage all for a $21 difference."

I even contacted the other company to ensure I was giving an accurate description of my Iphone 7 - 128GB. Their issue was the battery life - 78%. The competition did not devalue the phone unless it was below 50%. They responded after I did exactly as they asked and was denied based on their explanation of: \"Unfortunately, their standards are different than ours, so since we do deduct for poor batteries (anything below 80% according to Apple standards) we are not able to match to their \"Good\" pricing.\"Why have a guarantee of price matching if you are going to change your policy in mid transaction? I checked their site for the conditions of the price match and could not find any \"qualifiers\" concerning who they will match.What a waste of time and aggravation. I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!"

When I shipped it in the (factory box for protection), I carefully inspected all surfaces including the screen to check for any defects.  There were NONE, It met their standards for the condition stated and quoted a price for, yet they claimed it was not in great condition after they inspected it. They were basically calling me a liar. I noticed on their site that they were were now quoting a lower price for the same phone, so I can only assume that they were trying to renege on the price quoted because the market went down. I held my ground and told them to either return it in the same condition I sent it in or pay me what I was quoted. If there was any damage it occurred once they received it. They paid me what I was quoted."

I have tried doing business several times with this company in the past and they are the biggest con artist/ripoffs on the face of the planet.  Do yourselves a favor and before doing business with them or mailing our device consider facebook marketplace, the eco atm at any local shopping mall, or even trading it into the retailer you are getting your new phone from.  I have sent them several devices in the past including two recently.  All of my devices are always in pristine condition the only problem is they state they will \"price match\" and I try to price match them with declutter and they always find something \"wrong\" (this time they stated my device wouldn't turn on) yeah okay good thing I took a picture of it on while I wrapped it up and took a picture of the serial number before I sent it .  Then they try to tell me my devices are broken and devalue them to near broken condition and try to pay me close to nothing $50.  Then they try too bait and switch I'm sure they are going to send me back a device I didn't originally send them, or swap out the internals like logic board or send me back a bricked device.  Extremely suspect, the car salesman of iPhone resellers.  This company is a joke.  They do not answer their phones, their email is just some face they hide behind.  Regardless of what resolution you try to offer this review isn't coming down.  I also will never send you another device or recommenced you again.  You have lost a customer permently and hopefully many more future ones once they read this review."

Continuous form communication, not relevant to the actual status of my sellback, was NOT appreciated.  I received multiple form email messages and a form text message.  One of the email messages stated that they did not receive my phones--even when USPS reported them retrieved from the post office.  Replies to those form messages, including use of actual email address instead of form letter reply addresses, went unanswered--they did not respond \"immediately\".  Form communication sent over the New Year's holiday, even when it was stated that the office would be closed for the Christmas / New Year's holidays.  A telephone call to the company did not receive a response.  No bounce messages received when I tried communicating via email.  These communication problems would not have been an issue except they used intercom-mail.com to send their form communication and did not pay attention to details.  Experience not good--will be much more careful in purchasing cell phones to avoid needing to sell them.Reply:  Note that OPEN communication is NOT maintained.  NO responses were received to my emailed messages--both to your form letter email addresses and your standard email addresses.  Including the form letter inquiry stating my phones were not received when, in fact, they were picked up at the post office earlier that day.  Urgency is not maintained as no responses were received.  I will not be sending any emails to you as time appears to be wasted in doing so.Reply 2:  ANY missed email message is bad--however, MULTIPLE \"missed\" email messages = unprofessional.  I am an IT pro and know how email systems work."

I received their offers and accepted them and began the process.  Before I sent my items in, I read a couple of reviews which stated that they sent in phones in excellent shape then were told that they had scratches when received. When I get a new phone, I have a new case and screen protector before I open the phone. I then open the new phone, inspect it, and put on the protection. I am over the top ridiculous when it comes to protecting my phones.  Just to protect myself I videoed my phones and myself wrapping them. I even wrote to them asking if they wanted the original boxes and charging cables. As I said, I am over the top.  They did not. So I removed the protective screens, removed the cases, cleaned the phones and then wrapped them in foam, and then in bubble wrap before sending them. I received an e-mail when they were received and the e-mail said that I would be hearing from them in 5-9 days. On the 9th day I received e-mails that stated that I returned my items after the allowed 14 day return policy, so I would be getting a reduced amount.  After I had to bother myself sending them all the paperwork showing that I did not return them late, they agreed and said that I would not be charged extra for a late return. The next day I received my changed offers based on the deep scratches on my phones.  As I stated earlier, no, my phones were in perfect shape. I have the video since they had done this to others and I needed to protect myself. After mulling over my altered offers and thinking about the fight that I would get, the offers were not lowered enough to waste my time arguing with someone who would run such a scam for a few bucks.  I did get my money the next day. Now I have received my new iPhone 15 Pro Max and have an iPhone 14 Pro Max to sell.  It is in perfect shape, but I will be looking for a more honest company to sell them to."

I even offered photos of the phone that I took before I shipped it.  No scratch there but they also had a photo of a gold 13 pro with a scratch.  Who you going to believe?  Doesn't matter.  They offered me 30 dollars to sweeten the pot.  Anything good about all of this?  The customer service is professional and the process in general is good even if it took two weeks to unbox the phone and process the return.  Technically 10 business days. At the slowest end of their stated business process. Definitely strip the phone down and take a lot of good photos otherwise an unboxer might decide to use his brand new house keys to peel screen protector off.  Doesn't do them any good, to be fair, but it also doesn't do you any good.   I guess the adage \"never attribute to malice what can be just as easily attributed to ignorance\" applies here.  Whelp."

The phone did not have deep scratches when we sent it, and the vibrate function was not an issue per Apple's inspection 3 days prior.

They probably get plenty of people who misrepresent the condition of their devices either intentionally or not, but I confess their implication that I lied about my phone stung.

My screen needed to be replaced as it sometimes would not light up and I\u2019m not someone who would be capable of replacing it on my own. I put in specification of the condition of the phone which was pretty good I always had it in an otter box case it was almost scratch free except for a tiny Knick or two on the side mot the screen. After putting in the condition and an explanation of the phone and the issue it had I was quoted somewhere around 115 if I recall. I sent out the phone fully charged and reset. After they received it they emailed me and said the phone doesn\u2019t turn on even after charging it so they were now offering me 38$ after they already had it. The phone was fully charged and the phone did turn on and I had pictures of the phone on in full working condition the screen not lighting up was not something that happened all the time. I feel like this company basically quotes one way and then just tells everyone their phone doesn\u2019t work because at that point is the person really going to send it back and then try to sell it again? Probably not. I feel like I got scammed and I would not recommend anyone use this company to sell back their phone I think they would be better off going on eBay or marketplace.*in response to the company response below. They say \u201cjust like I said the device sometimes does not turn on\u201d. I explained already that it does turn on it just needs a screen replacement. That is a big difference from being damaged which the screen is to completely broken and not functioning. I do stand by this review and I will not recommend anyone uses this route to get rid of an unwanted phone."

I was quoted $719.82 and I got $701.00 due to some small scratches at the bottom of the phone.  Second an iPhone se 2020 which cost $449.99.  I was quoted $111 but only got $11 due to a battery issue which seems odd since it was less than 2 years old.  A disappointment."

While I wished it hadn't travelled down this road, this review got their attention and the situation was rectified within 2 days.I will say BB made it very easy to send in the phones, gave me a good price.  The problem was on the back end.  In the end, when I'm done with my current iphones, I will give BB another chance,  As such, I changed my rating from 1 star to 3 stars."

It had been very well cared for over the years, it was old but totally functional.  I actually didn't rate it as high as I could determine from their guidelines that it was; this rating implied a promise of a certain amount.  They found a defect that was not noticeable to the average human eye and they said the device was valueless.  I suspect those giving high ratings were selling much newer less used items than what I had.  You really can't expect a well used but lovingly care for device to be absolutely perfect and I tried to allow for that in my opinion.  The question keeps running through my mind, how much will these buy-back businesses make from reselling these \"valueless\" items?"

Mine had very very light and tiny scratches near the charging port from using the phone, you couldn\u2019t see them on the stainless steel of the iPhone unless put under the right light. I got offered an amount between the good and flawless bracket (closer to the latter). I am 100% sure my phone would be sold under Renewed Premium category on Amazon for 250$ more, so I could have gotten atleast 50$ more out of it from them. I had to accept because I deemed it was not worth the hassle to sell it myself and also because as soon as the new iPhone released all websites decreased their trade-in prices."

I sent in 2 items, 1 which was nearly flawless and they cut the amount I expected to get in half.  The second item I sent arrived with a damaged screen, it was not damaged when it left, that item went from $15 to $1.  I would use them again, but I would cover myself better knowing what I know now.*UPDATE*Buyback Boss contacted me to resolve my above issue and share that they are making updates to their quoting process.  Nice to see that Buyback Boss is listening to customers and making changes where needed.  Updated my rating from 2 to 4 stars."

I believe my phone was in mint condition and scratch free.  I was sent a picture of my phone with a scratch on the screen which I certainly do not recall. Unfortunately, I did not take a picture prior to mailing my old phone.  Nevertheless, Buyback Boss did agree to pay me mint condition price. I commend them for paying me a fair price.

My phone had no scratches on glass front or back and almost 90% battery capacity. It was otter boxed it\u2019s entire time with me.  It do have some wear on the plastic construction of the phone.  However, I simply made a counter about halfway between the two figures and it was accepted without contest. I got my money very fast through rewards@tremendous which is the digital check option.
