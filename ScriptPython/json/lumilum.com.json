That worked for awhile but it started turning off spontaneously, and when I called and asked for technical support, I realized that they don't actually know.  I mean, they're not electrical engineers.  So I had two electrical engineers come over to my house, and they both said they thought it was the connection from the transformer to the dimmer.  I had asked your technical support person if it could be the transformer, and he said definitely not.  When these products work, they are the best on the market."

There were so many missing specifications that I ordered less than 1/2 of what I might have ordered because I felt that I should spend as little money as possible to learn how your product actually works.  Pricing is super weird - it is cheaper to order 2x10 ft than to order 20 ft. Shipping is a mystery until you check out, assuming that you once again haven't had the basket emptied again. BTW, I am an engineer and a product manager.  Your website needs a lot of work."

Called the vendor just be sure and with no wait time I was able to talk to a \"real person\" who was very helpful and suggested a few additional items to aid in the installation. Although the product may seem a bit costly compared to the products available in home improvement stores they were not of the reliability and quality of the Lumilum product line. So glad to have found them online."

I was connected with one of Lumilum's representatives (Steve), who not only patiently described the different products but also helped me design and put together a lighting package for my family room. I received the order a few days later and easily installed the lights myself. The look of the lights exceeded my expectations! I was so pleased with the product and the entire experience, that I quickly got back in touch with Steve and he helped me design my living room/ dining room/ and kitchen as well. I'm impressed with their product line, knowledge, and customer service in helping me arrange and put together a fantastic lighting plan for my home remodel. I highly recommend Lumilum!"
