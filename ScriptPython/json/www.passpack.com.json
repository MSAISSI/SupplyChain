Since then they haven't bothered to be in touch.Protecting your data is literally the whole point of their service and they blew it.Avoid - these days there are better alternatives.Edit - to respond to their reply, I never claimed that the data was compromised. But I lost access to it due to a technical mistake on their side, and their communication about the issue suggested that they simply didn't care. If they messed up their old system, who says that their new system will be any better? Not a company I would trust."

          "Contenu": "I have been with Passpack for a fair few years now and have around 250 unique passwords and notes held with them, and it's always done the job. I was on the Version 7 type of account, paying for Premium.Last month there was some downtime that affected the Packing Key authentication page (my own idea of what happened, anyway). It basically said the key was incorrect, when I knew 100% that it wasn't (I'd been typing it in almost daily for about 3-4 years). Googling told me this happened every now and then they would eventually fix it. I contacted support during this time, explaining the issue, then again with the Google results I'd found, then again that it had been fixed and asking for information about it.To confirm, they key was never wrong, it was just the background authentication service. This was 100% not user error. I tested it with multiple accounts (Private and an old work account).All support requests were completely ignore with zero response. Googling shows this has become the new standard, it seems.Today the same issue occurred again, and I was locked out of my passwords when I needed them. I got zero response from support again.Twice is too much when my passwords are involved, so I've removed my passwords to another, more highly rated service and have deleted my account and will never recommend this service again.As a password manager service it does the job, but you cannot count on support and that is very important for such a service as this. For this I rate them two stars, as I like the idea of multiple passwords to protect your account (Password and packing key) and the interface is nice to use. It doesn't have any flashy plugins or whatever but personally I've never needed or wanted those. Besides all this, three stars are lost for the support side of things as that is unacceptable in my opinion."

While the product works fairly well for me and the web site has been kept up to date, the product itself hasn't been updated in many years in terms of functionality.

Some competitors have browser Add-Ons that could be useful, but I haven't tried them.A few bugs reported to Passpack have never made it to a fix, so here is at least one :\u00a0when using a Yubikey to login, you should wait patiently and refrain from typing the Enter key, as the Yubikey already has sent one. Doubling the Enter key leads you in a frustrating nowhere. I\u00a0have to tell all my employees who otherwise complain that Passpack doesn't work. Converting to a more standard use of Yubikey for 2FA would also be a neat evolution, but I must say support for Yubikey was a deal winner for Passpack at the time."
