Often times asking for the same information over and over again and missing several phone appointments.  If they were really able to deliver, they should charge a commission for the work they do but they don\u2019t.  Don\u2019t waste your money on this company."

At around 7 the night before, he receives a call saying there was an emergency and they cannot make it. Being so last minute, we were not able to get anyone to take him for his road test with a brake so he missed his test and ruined his entire day. They offered nothing besides my refund, which I was obviously entitled to receive. The service was horrible and it is impossible to get anyone to speak with on the phone. How disappointing for my son and all they could give was an apology."

In the 5 months we were \"trying\" to work with them they were ridiculously unresponsive and unhelpful.  You are supposed to get one monthly phone call.  In 5 months, we received ONE call.  At any given time, we were bounced between assigned concierges or not assigned one at all.  When we did have one, response time was often weeks at a time.  One concierge left the company, another contracted covid.  After reaching out with our concerns we were basically told that we should have requested a different concierge, but when your point of contact isn't responding for weeks how can you do that?  It took multiple emails from both my partner and myself to even get this disappointing response.It definitely doesn't feel like VIP service, and definitely not worth paying for."

I would like to request immediate refund! I really wasted my time and effort in believing in your value prop. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME BOOK AT THE DMV DIRECTLY."

          "Contenu": "Its been almost 3 weeks since I paid for Skips to help me get the funding I was already approved for.  The one on one concierge is as nice as can be however I am no closer to getting the funding from my eidl loan.  After reading reviews of skips and how much it cost it would seem like someone would call and speak with whomever to help your situation.  That is not the case the first response gave me one places into to contact I did not know and directed me to contact SBA which I have done 100 times before this point.  After that I once contacted again by Skips I was given 2 more contacts they hoped would resolve my issue.  One contact forwarded me to SBA and the other still has not responded.  The third time I was contacted by Skips I was asked to go make sure my funds havent been dispersed yet (which I knew they hadnt thats why I paid skips) and to contact my state representatives because that would be the final contact.  In conclusion for the price you pay you will recieve 2 or 3 contacts for you to email and be asked to do the same thing SBA is directing you to do with no help and no answers to why I have not recieved my already approved funding. The team is as nice as can be but so far have not helped with anything now I have been told to wait a week to see if anyone replies Im guessing so I will have to pay 100$ for another month."

Showed them what we do, Linkedin... 19 year biz, they flew at me. All good, go here, Dash is here... Get them to The Sign Up... big commissions. Put a first class email piece together... we have Lists. Server. Verification software. Tracking on sends. We took clicks! But their Click Tracking Service... in Transylvania... REALLY... was showing half on our Dashboard with them, of what we saw on our In Real Time stats. Fast as I can. Called, emailed, message... with the questions. Their tracking companies email address was bogus. We verified it as not a working email. Four weeks, a dozen attempts. Five call messages. Finally their \"affiliate Manager\" emailed (only because I kept c.c.ing to Ryder) and said... wait for it... your emails have us concerned! Ha. Good one. Now we can't get off the platform, every email SELL that comes through, we hit Unsubscribe and does nothing. We even  offered to give them our batch of confirmed Clicks to their Sign Up. We quit sending after 10 days. Our Dash shows Zero Sign Ups. Not surprising. Don't go near these guys. Not worth your effort. Month in, our time working for them... and the only reply on a simple, fair question... your emails are concerning. Stop calling us out on what we don't do and have no answer for and.... out of sight, out of mind."

          "Contenu": "I booked for a road test concierge through Skip and that was a HUGE mistake. First, it signed me up for their annual PAID subscription when I booked, which i suppose is my bad for not reading carefully enough. Totally fine, mistakes happen, I go to cancel the subscription. I can\u2019t find ANY way to do that on the site so after plenty of googling, I find their Terms Of Use and the link to unsubscribe there. I read it carefully, i have SCREENSHOTS of the TOS statement; no where did it say that cancelling the yearly membership would cancel my appointment. I even checked in the booked services tab to confirm, my appointment was still there and all good. Fast forward 2 weeks, day of my appointment, and THATS WHEN I FIND OUT IT WAS CANCELLED. I had no idea because 1) never got any email or contact about it 2) THEY KEPT THE MONEY FOR IT. If I\u2019d gotten some random refund I would have known immediately that something was amiss. I only found out because I contacted the driver directly with the phone number they provided. In their email response to me, they claim the driver cancelled due to emergency but happily offered to reschedule me~~~ but my driver stated that not only was there nothing booked today, but she hadn\u2019t been notified about a potential appointment at all. So they failed to schedule me, blamed it on an employee who had no knowledge and STILL HAVEN\u2019T REFUNDED ME. The second the conversation shifted from \u201cwe can reschedule you!!!\u201d to \u201ci don\u2019t want to be rescheduled I want a REFUND\u201d i got RADIO SILENCE. NO RESPONSE. I\u2019m still waiting!! And while I wait I will be leaving this review every where i can, so please do take your time Skip. I\u2019m telling you now, this service is a scam in the very literal sense, please do not trust them with your money."

          "Contenu": "I signed up for their vip program for $199 a month with 2 months free for their black Friday special. I talked to the onboarder on 11/28. After the onboarding call, they said they would email me loan options and grants. I never got an email that day. I waited over a week to hear something. Then I get an email from the company that no onboarding call was done or scheduled. They booked a call for me. I changed it for the next day when I got the email. They apologize for what happened and the previous onboarder will get back to me. If they don't they will follow up with me. The previous onboarder never got back to me and I sent the new onboarder an email that evening. I still have not heard from her the next day. I reached out to a few people whom I made contact with within the company. I am still waiting for a reply. I only got an email from a person to cancel my reoccurring billing. So the narrative of the story is they don't follow thru like they promised and they like to prolong things for people to keep being billed $199 a month. On top of things already being delayed with the processing time. Not to mention when you call their phone #, no one answers and no one returns the calls. I asked for my $199 back and if they don't refund it, I will file a dispute with my credit card. This company is a joke.  Don't recommend them. They are impossible to work with and they are not transparent. I'll watch there free youtube videos and find someone else to perform the service. This is what I recommend to everyone."

          "Contenu": "I had paid for a premium membership with Skips at the end of March 2022 to figure out why my EIDL loan had not be funded when I was approved and signed documents on 12-18-21.  The concierge was as nice as could be at advising me to call SBA (which I had done 100 times) to make sure my loan wasn't funded (I think I would know if that much money was in my bank account) then telling me to contact my state representative and that was the end of the line.  So that's what you get when you contact Skips and reach out for help for yourself or your business.  My loan had already been approved was already showing on my credit report and actually recieved an email to setup repayment for money I never recieved.  When I first signed up with Skip I was told I had recieved a free month of service set to begin the following month.  So after 30 days of going back and forth stressing, struggling,  and getting nowhere I was hopeful the following \"free\" month of service would be enough to get the funds dispersed.  However at the end of April 2022 I reached out to Skips to verify that I would have a free month which I was told \"yes thank you for your business\" however within the next 2 weeks my credit card was charged 5 times for the 95$ monthly rate.  Yes 5 TIMES twice being 5 minutes apart at 6am this morning May 6th 2022.  I was informed by SBA today that EIDL funds had been exhausted so I would not be receiving anything eventhough they did a hard pull on my credit and even put I had a 23,000 loan.  So now I have to deal with the credit bureaus and the SBA which we all know how thats gonna go since you can't get any information from them and my credit card company from all the charges from Skips. I am an honest hardworking American and I want to warn everyone SKIPS IS A SCAM!!! THEY WILL CHARGE YOU MULTIPLE TIMES WHILE TELLING YOU TO CALL THE SAME PLACE YOU HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH!!! After everything that has went on the last 2 years I didn't take a PPP loan because my buisness did not need it at the time, did not recieve any of the grants alot of scammers did recieve, and now my 6 year buisness I've given everything for health, family time, mentally, physically all goes down the drain while SKIPS tries to rob whatever they can get thats left..."

On September 10th I updated my pickup address, which is only 14 minutes from my previous one. They confirmed my new address by text message. Today, one week prior to the test, and just because I asked for an update, I was informed that concierges in my area are inactive. They canceled my appt and didn\u00b4t even speak with me about an option. Oh! Actually they suggested I look for local driving schools which provide a similar service."

To prevent any fraud, this is policy for nearly all companies.As mentioned, we got an exception to issue the 50% refund in this case, which normally we're unable to do. Please let us know when you receive the refund and as mentioned, please reach out to Ryder if you have additional questions on the EIDL grants and loans and PPP.I do see the record that he's spoken with you a couple times and has attempted to call you a handful of additional times as well.If you don't want the partial refund but would like to continue getting help from Ryder and our team, let us know and I can reverse.

Then I started to worry!! Calling, texting, live chatting, emailing \u2026 you name it!! Silence! One of the phone numbers on live chat was a wrong number (a woman picked up chewing her lunch surprised she got a call about smth she has noooo any clue!). Finally got a person on live chat talking like a \u201crobot\u201d but not giving me any answers! They say WE are legit! Well, give me a LEGIT answer..one answer pls!!! I took screenshots of the whole conversation. Then after a while she finally told me that that service is NOT available any more in my city!! What a hack!?!?! Why don\u2019t you update your website. There is a drop down menu to find your city..we\u2019ll update your information for the mother of Gods!! At they point after spending all the time trying to talk to a real LEGIT representative of That \u201cfunny\u201d company all I wanted is just to get my money back!!! This lady..Patricia is still talking like a robot..trying to be nice..giving one million excuses without any answers..I was typing straight that I do not want anything else anymore with the company..just give me back my money!!! She asked me to wait..again..and after another 15 mins just staring into my phone screen she says word by word \u201cthat the billing usually responds in 24-48 hrs!!\u201d OMG.

Jenee said that usually she had to coach people on what to write, but it wasn\u2019t necessary for the information I provided. She agreed that they would start to apply for grants on my behalf. So far, they have only applied to their own grant on my behalf. They have not applied to any other grant that I selected in my dash board. In my experience, if you are unmotivated and need a cheerleader to help you get funding then feel free to hire them. If you are motivated in getting your own funding then they are not necessary. I only wanted their help with grant applications and private credit opportunities. So far their only real solution has been to get a loan with Newtek. But I found over 3 banks that offer better rates and terms than Newtek."

The moment Jenee came on the line, she was upbeat and friendly and put me right at ease. She knew her way around nonprofits, knew her way around Latin American countries, and the needs thereof, and was very obviously knowledgeable in navigating the expectations of a donor base. Straight away she shared a phrase that has truly changed the trajectory of our approach. That is, \"We are not asking. We are inviting.\".  I can't say enough about how delighted I am to be led by Jenee and her expertise. Always looking forward to our next call. Thank you!!!"

I then met Mel.  Dejected depressed and really upset after what had been a year of hell I spoke to Mel.  She took so much time with me.  It felt like I was back in the 70's again with customer service.  Mel kept telling me not to give up and suggested a few things that I didn't think of.  In the end, if I didn't get with Skip I wouldn't have received my funding.  HelloSkip.com is the marketplace for government-related services and information for both individuals and small businesses. They add new services and information every single week and have excellent customer service. Mel, you're my hero!  Thank you."
