Instead I got a text message saying \"My payment was next in the queue and I should receive payment shortly\". That was last week and I still have not seen any sort of payment or had anyone reach out to me and explain why this is taking so long. The parts I sold were worth 30 bucks and they cant pay it out? I would think twice before shipping anything more valuable like a GPU or a Gaming PC, you might not ever see your money. So far this has just been a big scam. A big NOPE on this company, 1 star customer service, 1 star for reliability."

I sold my Xbox One and while many competitors were offering $70, SellGPU offered $90 which obviously impacted my decision to go with them. Also, I felt safe because I read the terms and conditions and they stated they paid for shipping even if they refused the product. I sold my Xbox July 27th and they claimed one of the controllers was faulty so they offered me $70 (the going rate) and offered to recycle my controller. I know my controllers works because I use them both. I advised I'd take the $70 but want the controller returned. They then asked for $10 to have it returned. I reminded the customer service rep that the terms and conditions stated they would pay for shipping and the representative would not acknowledge the terms and conditions and insisted I paid them to return my controller. At this point I recognized I was being deceived. They wanted to not only pay me what the competition was paying but actually pay me less. When I asked to escalate to a supervisor, I was declined. I have an active BBB complaint open. It's been 10 days and I don't have my Xbox or payment. Stay clear of this company."

          "Contenu": "Re: Order No 631322 I shipped a brand new Microsoft adaptive gaming kit for xbox along with an adaptive controller. Both were brand new and had never been used or taken out of the box. I received a message from sellgpu 10/05/22 that my items did not pass inspection and they did not give me a reason. They offered to send my items back upon request or would recycle in 5 days if no response from me. I immediately responded asking for my items to be returned and for a reason as to why they did not pass inspection. No reason was given but I received a response back same day that they would forward the request to ship back my consoles.On 10/07/22, they emailed me stating that they would get back to me with an update via email/sms as to when my items would be shipped back.Today 10/08/22 at 6:19pm eastern time, I received another email from sellgpu stating We\u2019re very sorry - unfortunately, the item(s) received did not pass inspection. Our apologies.We will hold the item(s) for 4 additional days (7 days from our original email) and then recycle them, unless we hear from you that you would like them shipped back.I am awaiting a response but this seems like a hoax. They\u2019re website states that the process is hassle-free and that is very misleading. I will never use this company again, does not appear to be trustworthy. It seems that intend to keep my brand new gaming kit and controller without paying me the $118.80 they promised under the guise of \u2018recycling\u2019 the items even though I\u2019ve requested multiple times for them to return my items back to me."

For what they offer u would expect a fast payout but I would sell it online instead of this website. It\u2019s better off that way anyways. I don\u2019t think I will sell my electronics here again. They promise same day payout but it\u2019s just a lie it turned into weeks which is pretty pathetic imo. Sometimes people need emergency money and they have really expensive gpus and parts so if you\u2019re looking for a quick cash grab you are better off selling it locally. 2/5 stars because they lowball you hard but at least they\u2019ll pay you."

I'll just take a loss and call it a day, because I'll never sell to them again. There are so many other ITADS willing to buy used IT equipment for much better prices. They list on their website that SellGPU guarantees that: \"Your components are 100% insured from the moment you ship.\" Well it's been over 2 months and no response from them.Edit 1/21/2023: They have responded after this review and have resolved the issue.

          "Contenu": "3 stars for the experience of trading in. I set up a rather large quote from selling 20 GPUs. The quote was on the smaller side of things and definitely could have gotten more selling privately but did not want to go through that process over and over so was really glad they offered a service that allowed me to just be done with it. Fraud people on eBay trying to buy it just wasn\u2019t for me so I was really looking forward to this. So I removed 1 star for packaging. It is presented on their website that they will provide packaging to mail the devices in. So these being pricey GPUs some of which I indicated have no box so I assumed it would be similar to something like Apple\u2019s process of trade in where the trade in kit can accommodate that and was part of the reason we went with them. Instead it was just like 3 medium sized boxes from Home Depot. So technically it worked but had to go and buy packaging for the cards with no box and just an extra step that I wish was a little clearer.I removed a 2nd star for communication. They emailed over and over again about sending the products in even though I had chose the wait for box option but no big deal probably an automated system. I ended up responding to one of the text messages because i actually had another card that I didn\u2019t include on the quote and wanted to add it in. So I text them and they say just include it in the box and our warehouse will know. Like oh okay simple enough\u2026I include it and then ship everything off. A few days later get an email that they received it and will be processing. Like okay cool and then bam refund hit the account bank account and it was all said and done. But the amount was for the quoted amount no mention of the extra card I included. No email response as to like a breakdown for each card just it\u2019s completed. Tried to follow up via text and no response.They were definitely quick with the refund and overall very timely and would probably use them again but just be super cautious and make sure you fill out quote correctly to begin with. Maybe try emailing them so there is a better paper trail? It would have been great if there was a website where I could log on to and see the status for each card or just see something regarding the order"

A LOT less work than Ebay.  4 stars instead of 5 because the amount you are paid is on the low end, but this is offset by the ease of getting these components out of storage and into use again."

I arranged it well enough to fit all parts and made do with added packing tape around the edges and box itself. Maybe they should consider sending a box at least 2-3 inches larger in length, width, and especially depth, to ensure all parts fit. SellGPU did live up to its deal and paid out within 48 hours of receipt of my items. I will use them in the future as it's easier to deal with than eBay."

The fact that you can request a box and packing materials free of charge made the whole process streamlined. They offer many payout options to choose from, which is great and you get notifications along the way when the package was sent/received/processed etc. Once they received my package - it was processed and I got the payout the next day. I absolutely recommend this service to anyone, if you want a quick, easy way to sell some old parts."

I did send on a Holiday so it took a little longer, but I totally expected that, so that was not an issue. Deffinatly would use them again, they are fast and trust worthy.Note: Changed to a 5 start review, I did not make a review to get them to SellGPU to send the extra $10, but they did, and I was super impressed. I know accidents happen, I would recommend this SellGPU to anyone wanting to sell some older tech they are the best hands down."

I think from the time from ordering the shipping box to the time I received a check (other options for payment are available) was maybe 3 to 4weeks. Prices are a little low ball, but you dint have to pay for shipping or wait for bidders on other sites. Older equipment has little to no value though. Good experiance, very little effort on my part."
