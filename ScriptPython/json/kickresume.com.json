After using 3 other programs, and getting the most help from Resume Genius, I pressed the rewrite feature, just to see if that is where Kick would shine. Nope, absolutely terrible. It was repetitive but in a really obvious way. Like using the word 'spearheaded\" for the  description of every single job experience. For the first bulletpoint, no less. I do think they have the most attractive templates, but that's the only positive."

The step-by-step guidance, resume templates, and content suggestions made the daunting task of creating a resume feel manageable and even enjoyable. The website's attention to detail and commitment to helping users present their skills and experiences in the best light truly set it apart.Moreover, the resume-writing tips and guides Kickresume offers have been invaluable in enhancing the overall quality of my resume."

Unfortunately user is locked into presets and templates that don't allow much in the way of formatting, style/look or design. I suppose it has to be that way for now.If anything Kickresume helps one get off their ass. It got me started/motivated to begin the loathsome task of writing a resume.One thing that's important to note is that HR and recruiters use scanning software for resume intake. The preferred document type is MS word doc. While companies accept other formats like PDF files, the scanning software doesn't always recognize these. So your submission will likely be neglected. I'm not sure if/how KickResume addresses this.I would probably ask for a refund, but it was fun to use all the features and see what it spits out. Again you will have to modify most of what the AI generates."

          "Contenu": "I've used KickResume off and on for the past few years, and I have to say that I can't recommend them further.This is for three main reasons:1. You don't get what you pay for. Yes, they have a variety of templates. Yes, there are a lot of visually appealing elements to the resume. But, frankly, over 80% of the resumes do not work with the extra fonts and adjustments without creating unnecessary overhangs, breaking words up without any actual basis (like leaving the last letter off of my name), and inconsistencies with branding between cover letter and resume templates (read: your name is all caps in one, but not the other).2. You pay for the templates and then lose access to them if you cancel your subscription. If I pay $19 dollars for access to premium templates, I should have permanent access to the resume with that template. If I try to change it, I should pay again - fine.  But charging me for a product that I can't access is wrong.3. The customer service is terrible. When I made a complaint about my problems with the resume templates, \"Nika\" (if that's even a real person) implied that my problems did warrant problem-solving because of a so-called new release.  In addition, she said that I didn't deserve a refund because of multiple downloads. As I pointed out to her, the problems occured when I downloaded the resumes. Ignorant of this problem, she did not respond.Also, as I have requested cancelation, I should not be charge for the next three months. KickResume has charged me, and I am not taking them to arbitration with my credit card company.By the way, a review of several of their positive reviews reveals that they use fake reviewers to up their positive score - good that they have time for this while not having time for customer service or product improvement."

You cannot key down the superlatives in rewrite. \"If you are 'light', you will shine.\"I would like to see a couple of simple templates that are less 'busy'.Also, AI analyzing the resume and bringing the conflicting paragraphs side by side and having all the suggested words in sight so that you can then drag and drop. That would be terrific.All in all, as someone that is hindered by dyslexia, this program has helped me immensely structure my thoughts.At the same time repetition as mentioned above have stifled me from finishing what I started. Thank you for the attention,All the best,Riakos"

I like resumes with some design flavor, as it's something appreciated on my field (software engineering; like colors, forms, icons and stuff).Sadly though, the available designs on premium are not a lot, so I had to stick with just one option that was nice for me. It'd be nice to have more designs available. Also, column configuration on a per \"fill-in\" item is not configurable, so you have to stick with either 1 or 2 columns depending on the template.Export does not allow you to change the design neither for further improvement, which was also a downer.Nevertheless, AI functionality and assisted creation experience is a breeze, which guarantees a more than optimal resume that can be used to reach the jobs you want"

          "Titre": "Average to Good\u2026with room to be GREAT\u2026",
          "Contenu": "From my personal experience, I have had frustratstion with the limited character space with \"open text\" sections when filling in job descriptions. However, I was impressed with the responsiveness & the \"fix\" that was put in place fairly quickly to remedy that particular issue.  Before purchasing any resume subscription, as there are so many to choose from, it came down to Kick, CV Maker, Slash CV, Canva, Cake resume, and the free options I looked at, Realtime CV, crystal resume, Enhancecv, & JOBCV.me all have great options and different formats along with many great templates and ways to be more innovative and creative to \"stand out\". However, for my immediate needs right now in the job market and the business I am in, Kickresume seemed at the time to best suit my needs, as I first heard about it through Product Hunt. First, I am impressed with the response from the development team when it comes to issues that arise with your users, that is the MOST CRITICAL variable when I sign up for site services like these. So, that is a huge plus, & not just the fact that the team responds when a user reach's out, they actually look into the issue and try to have a \"fix\" in place or help the customer out if it's a \"user\" issue and not a software/code problem.-Overall, the templates are good, the font choices are enough to get just about any look you want and all look good in text/resume formats.* What would make it GREAT!- Something that many many job seekers struggle with are gaps in work history, and the formats that you currently have, although you may not understand this, when the \"JOB TITLE\" and the Dates of that particular job are spread way way far apart on the page, it draws the eye, and attention to the recruiter, or hiring manager/compnay to this gap. So, you really only have 2 templates that somewhat mitigate this \"appearance\". The \"Green\" template which lists the job title, city/area, and then the dates right beneath, but highlights the job title in what ever color the user wants, which put the city/area and date in black right underneath, in affect, putting more focus on the title and vs the dates and city/region/area.  This may seem very trivial or something that users don't care about, but\u2026.. it is a BIG BIG deal because recruiters quickly scan resumes for a total of about 10 to 15 seconds, and when the date of a job is way way on the other side of the page, (isolated) away from the job title and city, this in a way puts BLINKING lights around a user that potentially only at a particular company/job/position for a short time, but it was significant because of the skill set or crtitcal networking/relationships/knowledge the candidate gained in the role, even though it was for a short time.  So, even though this may seem like a NON-ISSUE with your templates, it's actually a huge issue.  Had I known that I would not be able to manipulate the arrangement of how the: Job Title, Dates, City/region,  could be layed out on each job position section, (becuase of the industry I am in) I would have went with another site.Having the Job Title above the text description, or to the very left of the page, then have the dates of that position all the way over to the right of the page for that job, really is a huge problem and disadvantage for job seekers, applicants that want recruiters and companies to focus on the job description and skill sets, and not IMMEDIATELY have their eyes drawn over to the dates that particular job was held.So, because of this\u2026 I am limited to just 1 template, maybe one other because of this, which SUCKS!  I think this could be an easy fix, in giving the user the option to format how they want the job title, city/area, dates, etc formatted, or at the very least, being able to put the job title and dates all on one line. You guys have created some creative and eye catching templates which I am not able to take advantage of any of them due to this.Next - I catagorize your templates into basically only 2 versions; the one pager version where everything reads from left to right down the page, like reading an article.The 2nd version; is the 2 column version, which is split down the middle creating 2 sides of the page. This version (2 column version) is visually a wonderful idea, eye catching & a great way to get a 2 pg resume down to one if a recruiter or a web site won't upload a 2 pg document (which happens a lot). HOWEVER - this particular 2 column format looses it's effectiveness and utility for the thousands of workers, who work in industries that require more of a \"sentence, story structure\" for their job descriptions, vs. the job seekers/applicants who can simply use quick bullet points. For those people only needing to bullet out a quick few highlights per job, this 2 column format works nicely.  BUT, for everyone else who needs to type actual text, and not \"Bullet\" points, this format really looks horrible, and makes it difficult to read, especially if it's a 2 pg resume.However, if there was a way, for the user who wants to take advantage of all the 2 column templates your site has created, having the ability to widen the job description text box, or adjust the overall margins (right, left, top, bottom) would allow all the users that need to type in text, (not just quick bullet points) the freedom to use these 2 column templates your site designed.  Even just making the adjustment for a specific job description to fit on 1 column and not get pushed over to the right side column or even the next page, making is difficult to read and follow. Another additional or \"tweak\" that would GREATLY improve the templates you have (which 80% of them I can't use) is to have the functionality to minimize the Wasted Space at the top of the resume where the Name, contact info, e-mail, etc is placed.  Almost 99% of people in the healthcare/medical/research/pharma/etc sector of business DO NOT EVER USE PICTURES on their resume. Many of the templates have that option (which is great), however for all those thousands of users who will NEVER put their pictures on a resume, having the ability to shrink down that portion of the resume at the very top, or even to upload an image from another template that you have already used on your other pre-formated templates, almost like taking what you guys have already designed, and giving the user the ability to replace the area on the resume that is for a picture, and being able to place another formatted design that has already been created on another template.  OR - (What other resume sites are doing that is AWESOME), for all your customers/users that do not use photographs on their resumes, having the ability to design a quick \"logo\" or \"monogram\" of their initials, with some (pre-designed) options and colors a customer can choose from. You guys have in a way, essentially done a version of this with the \"Ladder\" template, which takes your intials, places them in a circle with an X in the circle, first & last initial on right & left.This is a great template I have wanted to use, however because of the job title, city/region/ and then the date beign all the way on the right side of the section, I cannot use this template.In addition, when choosing this template, along with a few others like, Rectangular, (Especially \"Blurred\") Pipeline, Doodle, Vegan, Dotts and Polygon, there is SO MUCH WASTED SPACE after the personal info header.  These templates are really fantastic and creative, but the amount of wasted space makes them totally unuseable for all the customers and users needing to type more text & content vs. bullets. If there was a way for the user to have an option to still use these great templates, but minimize the graphics, make them a bit smaller in scale for the page, push the top and bottom margins further up or down so the graphics could be thinner, almost like a border, instead of taking up almost 2 inches of the top 1/2 of the page, it would make a HUGE difference for all the customers that deciding to go with other resume sites instead of kick resume, becuase they have the options to take exsisting templates/graphics/pictures/monograms/symbols/ and size them just a bit smaller or bigger to fit their own needs. Polygon is a great example of this, the bottom graphic design is a much thinner line, giving a nice pop of color, but not OVERWHELMING the overall appearance.  Polygon is wonderful template, but because the user does not have any ability at all to shrink down the top colored graphics that in some instances for certain professional fields, is too too much, but it's still a great design if the user could just make is smaller, or even shift it to the left or right side, same with Blurred and Pipeline, great design, but no way to shrink it, so that it is \"scaled\" to be in proportion with the overall resume's look, (which many customers need). Another tweak - the way the \"Strenghts & Skills\" section is formatted. this is a OUTSTANDING idea (especially in the industries I mentioned above), however having other options that would Print and look cleaner with regards to the \"strengths\" section when the user can type in select words or phrases, then all those words get formatted into a \"square\" with rounded corners.  On a computer screen, this format looks very impressive\u2026.. BUT not so much when printed. Many of the templates you have designed, when using a darker color, this section makes the actual \"box\" that your word and/or phrase goes in very very dark, sometimes black, and your word/phrase \"white\"\u2026this DOES NOT PRINT WELL.  Having a very more options around design, or format with the \"Strenghts/skills\" section and how it an be formated or designed on the page would really be huge.  The \"Circle or Dots\" design is fine, but not for a user wanting to list out just \"words\".  Having the ability to potenitally put: different symbols by each word in a variety of colors, No more room 4 comments..."

Negative: Where did the percentages come from!? I have never included any numbers in any of my descriptions, yet AI ended up including % I never entered! My previous employments did not involve sales or measurements. Examples: \"I improved sales by 39%.\" \"Customer service satisfaction rose by 13%\". Neither of these are true (where did they get those specific percentages from?) and I removed them. While I like the action words, I could have used Bing/Bard to find them. I do like that there are lots of different templates and once you enter your information you can preview all of them. Still learning the site and I haven't created a cover letter yet so let's see what happens! I paid for it and hope to get my money's worth. More specifically a JOB!"

And the latest was two days ago, when I could subscribe to the premium plan for 10 days  and for free after easily validating my student status. Also the costumer support on the two times I've used was quick and efficient.4 stars because I spent a good amount of time editing my cv only to realize that I couldn't download it for free.

The best thing is that you get a professionally prepared CV by AI in just five minutes from beginning to end. Later, you can alter it to suit your needs.I advise anyone looking for a quick and effective resume-building experience to use Kickresume. My resume has been greatly improved and looks much more professional thanks to Kickresume's AI resume writing services. I think the cost I paid for it was reasonable given the things it delivers. Kickresume distinguishes itself from more expensive resume apps with its extensive functionality. It does not, however, offer the ability to upload an existing CV, which can be a drawback for certain people."

As a new design graduate applying for a wide variety of positions, the ability to really quickly try different formatting is super useful.A few features show great promise, but aren't quite there yet (or at least in terms of being useful for me specifically.)I still found myself using ChatGPT as the AI functions weren't really so great.  I do love the auto- review options that give you some metrics on repeated words and other things-  however it would be a great feature if this could have some user settings around location.  I am in Australia and my understanding is that the expectation here is that Resumes should be longer (2-3 pages)- so it often tells me things are too long. (which they may be- but i also think the program is a bit US centric in it's concept of what a \"good\" resume should have.All and all, even though it is a bit expensive I am glad I purchased a yearly plan.  It's great to know I can very easily create a great looking resume tailored to the position I am applying for- (job hunting is stressful enough without fighting formatting!)I know lots of online advice says to keep resume formatting plain and boring so ATS can read it- but as a designer, that wont work for me.  (I've become a bit annoyed that we've started telling people to design things for machines to read (ATS) rather than for people to read.  This is not the way technology should be working!)"

So after I signed up, I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to select an appropriate format, even though some were simply cosmetic in nature. The most impressive part was the simple guide format to filling in sections, either from scratch or by importing from an existing resume. The AI system can be used to automatically create content, but it certainly needs editing afterward as it tends to be a little flowery. Overall, it is a great tool, gives you a lot of flexibility and the ability to restart your creative juices and a fresh rewrite."

When I tried to create my cover letter to go with my resume, it wouldn't allow me to use the AI option because it said I'd used up all of my credits. I didn't even know I was using any sort of credits. I played around with creating resumes with the AI option unknowingly using up the credits. Really wish I'd of known about the limit to begin with, I wouldn't have waisted all of the credits that way.... But, at least I did get one really awesome resume outta it.

KickResume continues to be a great help to me. It saves my time and sanity during my search by enabling me to create a core resume and then easily make boutique versions, adjusting job titles, SEO words, and sections that fit the role I want to apply for. The built-in AI writing tools are extremely helpful. So are the cover letter templates.  Applying for jobs can be an emotionally draining and time-consuming process, and we can end up doubting ourselves. I am grateful I found KickResume because it has saved me so much time, effort, and stress and I know my resume looks sharp. That enables me to focus more time on searching for opportunities and networking. I recommend this platform to everyone."

I am an educator and have been teaching resume writing. Now, it is not really making any sense to do it yourself when there is an application that can do it for you and does it well in the shortest amount of time. We have to work smart not hard. Kickresume has made it easy to build cover letters and resumes. This is the one application that was easy to use, straightforward, with no hidden agenda behind it but to help. I hate those that help you build your resume but will not release it to you until you pay. That is not the case with Kickresume. I suppose they understand that making a cover letter and resume means you need a job to make money. Until then, you are running on straws. So, there is no time a wasting here. I just wish they existed a long time ago. Well, now that it is here, you can work smart and build your cover letter and resume with Kickresume to hopefully get you through to that interview to land that job.  I have built both my son's and my cover letters and resumes using Kickresume while having coffee in the morning before getting ready for work. Thank you so much Tomas Ondrejka (co-founder of Kickresume)."
