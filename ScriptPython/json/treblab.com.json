I've gone through the factory reset tips, powered off and back on before connecting to my phone... nothing seems to remedy this issue.I originally wrote a second review here after receiving a replacement pair of earbuds, as the issue mentioned above did not happen with them on first use. Upon using them a second time, the issue returned in full. Seeing as the only response to support ticket is to ship yet another pair of earbuds, I can only advise AGAINST the X3 pro."

Next email from company stated it will arrive on a date that was PRIOR to their own email.  Totally disappointed.  The product itself is just OK.  It has too much treble and not enough base.  Sound quality not what I was used to with my other brand.  Will not go through hassle to return, but will order my original brand next time, since the quality of sound is MUCH BETTER!  Sorry Treblab, but not a fan!"

I'm assuming because the port is on the bottom of the speaker, it will wear out and be problematic.  Anyway....Trying to communicate to Treblab that I want to have it repaired (at my cost) is proving to be a chore.  I'm a week in to emails to be told that the warranty is expired (no kidding) and they will give me a 15% discount for another purchase.  I truly LOVE this speaker and was just trying to get it repaired.  The customer service has been just awful! UPDATE....Now customer service said they do NOT Repair their own products.  I will NEVER recommend or buy anything from Treblab!!!!  $200 for a speaker that I used for a little more than a year.....NOPE"

The charging port is at the bottom of the speaker and apparently very fragile.  Had this speaker for just over a year.  Now I own a BRICK.  Spoke with customer service to try to have repaired (at my cost) and was told that they could not repair but they would be happy to give me a discount on a new speaker.  I don't know about anyone else but I don't appreciate spending close to $200.00 for a speaker that works for just over 1 year.  EVEN IF I decided to buy a new one, how long would it last and would I be in the same boat with the charger.  I am very disappointed with Treblab.  I will go with another company that can stand behind their product and be able to fix it if it goes bad. I DO NOT recommend this speaker."

A special thanks to Ksenia!I have had the Treblab X2 for years and loved it. The fit is good and they are comfortable, and the sound is very good, so when I wanted a 2nd pair of buds, I ordered a pair of the X5's. I made the mistake of getting them directly from Treblab (rather than Amazon) for the 10% discount, and was disappointed as soon as they arrived. The fit and comfort were just \"so so\" and the sound is completely lacking in bass. To make matters worse, after about 1 week they stopped working. My phone showed them to be connected and the music showed it was playing, but there was absolutely no sound coming from the buds. I contacted Treblab    and the only option I was given was to send them back and once they received them, they would send a new pair, i.e., there was no return for refund option as I would have had with Amazon. And just as an aside, I mailed them back 6 days agona nd haven't heard a word back."

          "Contenu": "I purchased two bluetooth audio headsets recently: N8 ear buds, and Z2 headphones.  The former arrived with instructions for use, whereas the Z2 had no instructions included (an empty disc pocket in the case for ???).  I had to spend lots of time fitting the N8 ear buds, and after trying all combinations of the bud covers and the ear hooks, one ear bud still does not fit well -- I really don't see how these would stay lodged in ears when someone is running or exercising vigorously.  Once I learned the controls on the headphones, they've worked fine (when they stay connected to the audio source*) and are comfortable, although without instructions I learned that the on-off button is not associated with the control for a bluetooth connection, and I've had to re-charge a few times following short periods of use (2 hours).  *Another issue is that both earbuds and headphones shut down during use - initially connected fine with computer sound source, but then mysteriously I hear \"power off.\"  Some of these issues may be associated with operator unfamiliarity or error, all the more reason why clear, written instructions for use are an important feature that have become an afterthought with many electronic devices of late, a complaint I've heard from others about purchased products lacking sufficient instructions and trouble-shooting information."

          "Contenu": "I\u2019ve had the product for about 3 weeks now and it\u2019s satisfactory. I was having issues in the beginning with the earbuds not linking to each other and I was about to return the product. In the process, I found instructions with trouble shooting and was able to resolve the issue. The X3 Pros do what\u2019s advertised and stay in your ear while you workout. I\u2019ve jumped rope and lifted weights in these and so far so good. Haven\u2019t tested how water resistant they are and am reluctant to do so because I do t want to break them. So in that regard, I\u2019ll have to wait and see during my cardio events. The sound quality is decently loud but not as satisfying as I\u2019m used to. I like to listen to Rap or rock when I workout and sometimes bass is not as good. You\u2019ll have to find that happy medium with turning up the headphones and the volume on your phone because they don\u2019t exactly align. Voices and music could get kind of staticky or muffled which is annoying when I\u2019m trying to get motivated with the music. Even though the music doesn\u2019t exactly have the quality I am used to, it does get plenty loud and you could drown out your surroundings which is a plus for me. This product checks my boxes for a workout partner and I hope that future earbuds made can attain that better quality sound that I\u2019d prefer."

I apppreciated her efforts and attention and decided to take the offer.  The agent seemed to go out of her to resolve the issue and wanted to make sure I was satisfied with the outcome despite Treblab's Return Policy.   From now on I'll be more careful buying speakers over the Internet.The return policy of Treblab seems out of sync with other leading internet shopping sites for electronics.  Specifically, the day I received my speaker, I contacted customer service to ask how to return it because it was too big and did not sound as good as I expected.  There is no way to know this until after the speaker is received an listened to.  After following-up on the email, I learned that Treblab would withhold 20% (or possibly more) of the price of my speaker.  Further, it wasn't until I asked a second time that I learned that Treblab would take 10% off of the cost if I kept it - a small discount at best.I am not happy at all with the policy and the need to have multiple interactions with Treblab to help resolve this.  Still waiting on my 10% credit confirmation"

I get a separate pair for two different devices, and I've done that three times now... That's 6 sets of earbuds in total, replaced roughly every 2 years when the battery life starts getting low.But please, please, please TREBLAB folks, if you're seeing this, BRING BACK THE XR800's! Those were my favourite earbuds by far. The XR700's have the same great sound quality and bass to them, but they're just not as comfortable, and the charge port on the 800's was in a much better spot, with a better water-tight plug."

However, the product manufacturer, TREBLAB, actually cares about customers. Thankfully, I got my refund.In other news, I got a pair of their Z2 noise-cancelling headphones. I was able to stress-test this by taking it on my 3 hour flight last weekend and it shined. Not only was I able to successfully drown out crying baby sounds, but also able to enjoy some relaxing audiobooks connected to my iPhone's Bluetooth.The battery life on this thing is also impressive. Anyway, TREBLAB is good.StackCommerce, Entrepreneur.com - they're still trash companies that don't care about customers.Have a great day!-Original-My experience with them could have been better but I never received my product due to their distribution partners being scammers. Beware of how you order these products and avoid sites like Entrepreneur Store and StackCommerce. No way to reach customer service by phone. Had to get credit card fraud department to help get my refund. Not worth the hassle."

I was lost in the music and in my world , by far these are thee best Noise canceling head phones I've had or had the pleasure of using , comfortable and wearing for hours during a flight will not be an issue , nor will hearing others on the plane.... only draw back I see happening is missing the drink cart on my next flight as I won't be able to hear her .... again amazing wish I found these years ago"

With the bass this speaker puts out it is almost like I have a little mini subwoofer system for my ebike! It definitely turns heads. The only thing louder would be a wired system for power.

I just ordered and received the X3 Pro pair as a 2nd pair to keep on hand at work, but now I can't use the original pair because they are even more wonky since the left is broke.ETA: Ksenia was so great about helping me with this issue. They sent me a new pair of the old model I had, but they were defective and sent me a new pair of the X1 earphones that, so far, are working great! I really appreciate the fast and wonderful service!"

Not only is their customer service BEYOND EXCEPTIONAL, they have quality products for a reasonable cost.  They always back their products up and I am forever grateful for that.  Every customer service agent that I have worked with in the past has been phenomenal!   I am a workout addict and workout 5-7 days a week for years now, and I ONLY use Treblab. My backup pair are my Beats, (that were a gift).  I hate the sound quality on them and their fit.  I do not get NEAR the insane workout I do with the Beats as I do with my Treblabs.  I have recommended Treblab to multiple friends who are just as happy with their purchase as I am.  There isn't enough positive things I can say about the products, the seamless quality, the superior customer service, and exceptional care I receive through Treblab!  Their products are so good, I plan on purchasing a new bluetooth speaker soon for the summer months, as well. I promise, you won't be disappointed!!!"
