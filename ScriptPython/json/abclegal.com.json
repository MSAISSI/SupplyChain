When this was brought to your attention, you stated that you would charge an addition $150 to go back out to complete service.  In 16 years of practicing law, I have not ever had a process server determine when service was appropriate based on the party being served saying that they filed bankruptcy or had an attorney because, I would imagine, that is not what the process server is being hired to do.  Please refund the money charged for this service and I will remove the negative review online.  We found another process server for this job."

I initially chose to go with ABC because they are a larger company and felt they could get the job done, however I am now learning this was possibly a mistake and I am probably just another person they can overcharge and deliver subpar results to because they are too big to care."

Customer service reps and supervisors place you on hold and then hang up on you.  Phone service hangs up on you after being on hold for 10 minutes.  No replies to messages and requests for corrections.  BEWARE, watch your proofs of service."

I had to call another local processor to do a rush job to fix the mistakes of ABC Legal. Oh, and the local process server finished the job in less than four hours."

It turns out, that If they successfully serve an individual based on my past experience they would e-file the affidavit documentation to the court. What their supervisor told me and what their website claims are totally inconsistent what happened to me today."

I contacted the company and was the address was corrected and he would mail the new Proof of Service directly to me. My second contact to the company was concern that the new Proof of Service had not been signed. I was updated through the dashboard on 9/8 that it had in fact been mailed to the Atlanta office on Wednesday, 9/6. I contacted the company again on 9/8 and told them I had been told the original would be mailed directly to me. I was placed on hold and then assured that the corrected original was placed in the mail directly to me that morning and would be uploaded to the file. As of today, 9/9, a signed Proof of Service is not showing in my file. I have found this process very frustrating."

Nevertheless, ABC Legal dispatched different servers for each entity and for some reason, each time, only one entity was served. Each time we would begin the process of me explaining that it was the same company, them dispatching different servers, only one or none served. This process was repeated over and over until I finally let them know it was ridiculous that they could not serve one company, at the same address. After I brought this up - Voila! - a process server was dispatched that same day and service was completed. I'm sure this is how ABC Legal racks up costs, so we will not be using them in the future."

Another day goes by and nothing Bruce claims he couldnt make it out yesterday but promised he would go today. The level of incompetance is unbelievable. So today I asked to speak with the Supervisor Vincent who is the client support manager. I told him how unacceptable this was and said Bruce will definately go out today. I said I cant waste anymore time on meaningless promises. I wanted a different process server assigned. His response was that Bruce was assigned and that he will for sure Go out today. I insisted that anyone but Bruce and his second response was that maybe I should issue you a refund. I said that would be a good Idea. Need to deal with compatant professionals. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!"

Once they finally get back to me about fixing them, I go to download them and while I had two different documents, they uploaded the same proof of service for both of them, not the proof of service for each separate one. It has been days since I notified them of this issue, I've only gotten one message back, saying they are reaching out to another team member to figure out the issue, but the issue is a very simple matter of uploading the correct PDF. There are a lot more affordable process servers out there, if I were in a case that had a higher level of urgency I would expect ABC Legal, especially for the price, to do much better."

I had to ask them to let me know that.  The contact for my issues was helpful.  It was a very lengthy process that I felt I had to track every minute."

The other was not attempted because the server had \"technical issues\" printing the document to be served (1 page document). The server did not contact ABCLegal to remedy the issue.  I phoned ABCLegal, four days after requesting service, to check on the status. It was then that ABCLegal reached out to the server and remedied the issue and reduced charges to base charge.Additionally, when I attempted to contact ABCLegal in Atlanta, I heard music, then transferred to someone's email.  I have yet to be able to contact the Atlanta office, specifically in the a.m. When I called the long distance number on the website, I heard a recording stating that the office would not open until 8:30 a.m., in a different time zone that is three hours behind ours.  So I had to wait three hours to contact ABCLegal.  This was not acceptable, as my client requested the status of the two services.The first time I was able to get someone on the phone, in the different time zone, I gave her my information and we were working to resolve the issue, I was disconnected.  The service rep made no attempt to call me back.  So I again called for assistance, and connected to a different service rep. This service rep was knowledgeable and was able to give me details of the service that was not yet completed. While I was not satisfied at all with the process server's failure to serve and communicate with ABCLegal, I was happy with the second service rep who remedied the issue.  Lastly, ABCLegal was unable to provide me with a working direct number to their Atlanta office.WELL THERE SEEMS TO BE NO APPARENT WAY TO REPLY TO YOUR RESPONSE.  NO EMAIL OR PHONE NUMBER EITHER.  AND THE EMAIL ADDRESS THAT SENT YOUR RESPONSE IS A NO-REPLY EMAIL ADDRESS."

I cannot figure out how to go back and review my initial notes when entering a service request; and, I would love to be able to talk to someone by phone when there's a complicated service needed.  ABC Legal Services has been absolutely great with all our other services to date, and we will continue to use them, but may need to look elsewhere for the complicated services."

          "Contenu": "Our experience with ABC Legal overall was OK but not completely painless. If we were to serve someone else, we would still use them without a doubt. This was the first time we were serving someone and using ABC Legal. That's why I decided to write a detailed review, which might help others especially regular people. 1) Website and the online system is fantastic. The website is functional and responsive, which makes all the difference. It allowed us to see the progress (and lack of it at times which allowed us to identify and resolve problems). You can contact customer support from the website and they reply very quickly. 2) Timeliness: This item is a mixed bag. We submitted our documents and after 2 days all activity stopped on our case. After a week of no activity, we contacted them on the website, and hearing nothing for sometime we called them to see what was happening with our case. They immediately identified the problem, and upgraded our service to speed things up. The service was completed the next day. The case was closed 10 days after the service was completed. However, at that time we had not received the original copy of the service affidavit. When we contacted the customer support from the website, we were told to wait 10 more days and it would arrive, however, it did not. After these 10 days (20 days after the service was completed and 5 days prior to the hearing), we contacted the customer support again to find a solution for this issue. After going back and forth several times (this was painful on our end), ABC Legal was able to get the process server to prepare and send us another affidavit, which was to be delivered only 1 day before the hearing. This caused a lot of stress on our end. However, it was successful. So overall score for the timeliness is poor but can be improved.3) Problem solving: Excellent. Every time we contacted ABC Legal, we talked to people who are problem solvers. They are doing their best to help their customers. 4) ABC Legal Team: Fantastic. Such an amazing team of people working there. They have the kindest and the most professional people in their team. 5) Value for the money: Given everything, it is good. Feedback for ABC Legal: Closing the case after the customer confirms the receipt of the affidavit of service (or attempt) would be a better practice."
