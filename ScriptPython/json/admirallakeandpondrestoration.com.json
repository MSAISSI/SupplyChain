Makes a world of difference."

          "Contenu": "I took my time to research the best tools to clean up my lake in hopes of creating a swimming area. I was happy to find a local company that had low prices and decided to purchase a lake rake, an aqua/muck blower, the deep stake mount, and the weed roller mount. Every piece of equipment has been highly flexible, and has filled a major need of mine that I was unable to find elsewhere, especialy in the case of the deep stake and weed roller mount for the muck blower. Now, I can use my blower anywhere along my 300' of lake shore, tidy things up much faster, and my favorite - attach the muck blower to my weed roller for a full 360 clean that gets EVERYTHING. I'm really impressed with all of the equipment and my wife would tell you, I'm not easy to please!"

The kids and adults alike had an absolute blast skating and we cut down on our usual rink-making time by at least half. The whole process was so much more convenient. Truly a must-have for anybody that regularly makes an ice rink!"

It doesn't have any plastic materials, so it gives a feeling of quality, and the compact design is nice for installing and removing. The light kit option is beautiful and the timer that comes with the lights is convenient as it can be set automatically according to ambient light.As an aerator, it seems good, much better than smaller fountains we've purchased online, and  less than the big industrial one we had, but that is to be expected given the horsepower difference. If anything goes wrong, it has a lifetime warranty on everything but the cord (3 yrs), very impressive. I'm very happy with my purchase and may be purchasing another if I can convince my husband that we need a lake aerator up at our cabin!"

Unlike Weeders, Admiral quickly responded to all of my questions, did not use any bait and switch tactics, and were very up-front about pricing and what to expect. As for results, the JetStream Aqua Blower has cleaned up my muck and weed issues by and large and I am very content. My neighbors can't say the same about their Weeders Digest Aqua Thruster. My apologies for bringing up the competition during this review; I wanted to shed some light on my purchasing journey up to this point and highlight what I felt both the highs and lows were for others to see and (hopefully) learn from."

Great product and already recommended to lots of friends and family.  Looking forward to this winter and making an even bigger pond hockey rink."

Initially I was a bit taken aback at the prices of other 2 HP fountains and ended up getting the 1.5 HP Admiral model with a light set and the pump attachment (btw, this accessory is worth it's weight in gold!) and paid less for it than I would have paid for some competing units' 1 HP fountains with lights. I couldn't be happier with my decision! The lights are beautiful, my pond stays aerated, and I can even use the pump attachment to turn my fountain into a pump - I just connect the attachment to a garden hose and can water my wife's plants in summer and even make an ice rink in the winter for the kids! I'm thrilled at how the fountain has gone so far above and beyond what I expected.Truly a great product. Thanks to everyone at Admiral Lake and Pond!"

Aside from removing the muck, it blows away the root systems of the weeds. Now the areas we have cleared with the Jet Stream are weed free!With the deep muck we are dealing with, I keep the Jet Stream in an area for 12 hours and it clears an area of 5\u2019 wide by 10\u2019 long.My neighbors and friends are amazed at the results and I have referred them to Charlie and his amazing product.
