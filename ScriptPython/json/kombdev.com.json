          "Contenu": "I contracted your technician AMD to visit my home in late June or early July to set up my new computer, and he did an outstanding job. My following feedback reflected my complete satisfaction. I had some relatively minor computer problems I wanted fixed and called him to set up a remote session, set for this last 6th November 2023.   He managed to solve all but one of the problems: the installation of a password management service. So we left that for another day, which we set for the following week on 13th November.  During that session his remote software failed several times, and in the end the password software could not be installed because we ran out of time because of the time it took to try repeatedly to get the software to work.  I called him back and he agreed to return the following week via a remote session which I understood to be without charge.  But he never called back. So I have now paid $79.99 for each of two sessions, or a total of $159.99, of which in effect the second payment for no result at all.  I am not at all pleased by this, and am not inclined to contract your services again in the future as a result.Yours sincerely,David J Robinson"

That's pretty amazing, convenient, and VERY appreciated!  The only suggestion I would have is more transparency on the corrected components and parts ordered - the invoice lists everything out but maybe sharing documentation for the parts that were ordered or work orders that are being performed - stuff like that - might be something they could consider providing in the future.  Otherwise, everything was super quick and painless and I would highly recommend this service to others!"

After years of denials and outrageous quotes from companies telling me that they could NOT assist me with my computer issues, KombDev not only accepted the challenge, but successfully completed EVERY issue that I was having in record time! And, did this for A FRACTION of what some of the other companies were requesting!! I have given them more business already!In the timespan from 4/11/23 \u2013 5/2/23, KombDev fixed and delivered: 1) Solved iPad to phone connection bugs and disruptions on site2) Recovered all unaccessible data from broken, external hard drive and placed it onto new drive3) Revived a broken 2009 laptop, upgraded necessary parts, ensured all data was secure, yet accessible, AND updated the machine so that it now runs as well as my 2019 MacBook Pro!!!The company owner, Anthony, is extremely friendly, knowledgeable and his customer service is ABOVE AND BEYOND! For client ease, Anthony arrives at the customer's home for onsite work and/or takes items back (for fixing.) He takes the time to listen and discuss the issues with his clients, and has the ability to communicate the most complex ideas in a a way that a less experienced client can understand. During the fixing process, Anthony updates the client at each step and ALWAYS obtains client approval if a part is needed, and once complete, will return your finished items to your door!I HIGHLY RECOMMEND KombDev!!!"
