          "Contenu": "Placed my order on the website and got overcharged due to what appears to be a backend programming issue in their online system. I selected a $130 delivery+installation service and during checkout it added and then later removed an additional $75 delivery fee. My final receipt didn't reflect this fee so I thought it was all good and sorted, but my credit card did. I was overcharged by $75. This made sense because when the delivery day arrived, the delivery crew's work order showed delivery -only- which caused them to refuse to install the washer and dryer I ordered until during delivery, their app updated and showed a separate work order for delivery+installation, like I paid for. I am still trying to get this matter resolved. I called EE customer support and they said their side only showed what was on my receipt, so I'd need to contact Synchrony and have them resolve the matter which I did, and they told me it will take upwards of 65 business days. Unreal."

When I received the TV it was broken with visible damage to the screen and the unit flashed light without ever turning on. When we asked for a replacement Electronic Express stated that we would need to return the unit in all of it's original packaging to process a refund (the TV at this point is on the wall with the box and packaging in the garage and the garbage), then purchase a new TV from them at the current (non Black Friday) price. The customer service rep was rude as well. Thanks for costing me $500. Ill never purchase from a 2nd tier electronics retailer again."

The problem is I work a normal 9-5 job and I can't take off of work for a sound bar delivery. Okay, no big deal, let's just cancel the order and refund me... except they will charge me $40 for cancelling my order. This same exact problem is happening with the TV I ordered from this company except with $300 instead of $40 and I wholeheartedly suggest you look at any other company to buy your electronics. This company is full of scam artists and the assistant manager I spoke with had an attitude from the minute she took over the call."

There was no call and the shipper dropped in in our driveway while we were out of town for the weekend. More problematic, the dryer arrived on a pallet, unprotected and severely damaged. It was clear something heavy got stacked on it during shipment as it was not protected or labeled against stacking in transit. The retailer has been stubborn in response to the damage and we are stuck with an unusable appliance, in spite of our emailing a photo of the damaged shipment the day we arrived home to find it in our driveway. In hindsight it was unwise to purchase an appliance from out of state, but this specific model wasn\u2019t available locally.  Steer clear: the deal was simply too good to be true, and they don\u2019t stand by their (unreliable) shipping methods."

The company called me and said \u201cthey just shipped the dryer, it just left their warehouse and would be to a freight terminal in our town in 6 to 10 days\u201d the next day they emailed to say that the dryer is out of stock, but \u201cthey have several already on order and they will be to their warehouse in 4 to 6 weeks\u201d. Strange since they told me they already shipped the one I ordered to us. Then I get an email that says the dryer is no longer manufactured and they can\u2019t order anymore so they are canceling my order, also strange considering they said they had already ordered several and they would be in stock and 4 to 6 weeks. I already knew the dryer in my color was no longer manufactured, but some stores still had some in stock. I was looking for my exact color to match my washer, and because they are no longer manufacturing that color the ones that are left are really really expensive. It bothers me that a company said that it had already shipped something and even called me to tell me, but that was a lie and then it said that it had already ordered more to be coming in stock, when in fact, that was a complete lie too. In the meantime, I have to wait for them to reimburse our money before we can buy another dryer\u2026Still waiting btw. Honesty is the most important thing to me. If your company cannot be honest with me, they cannot get my service now or in the future I would have been fine being told the dryer was out of stock and they were going to try and order more and then find out they weren\u2019t able to, but instead I got lied to."

Further update: After they refused to contact  UPS and requiring UPS to return the item to them they have charged a $35.15 restocking fee and take no responsibility at all for their system accepting an address they cant use and no it does not state no PO boxes on their order form. They refuse to return the $35.15. Bad policies, bad customer service. Never again with this Company. I will be filing proper complaints with the proper agencies. Avoid the hassle."

It was insane, instead of accepting that it was entirely the store fault including the manager who sold me the wrong product and that they will fix it right away, he wanted m to come to store pay the difference and then reschedule the visit. Not an experience I will go through again."

I was trying to do the installation myself and realized the power cord delivered for the dryer was a little shorter in length to connect to the plug and so I had requested for letting me know the procedure to see if this can be returned and get a refund as I couldn't go to a near by Electronic Express store to exchange. I was informed someone will reach out to help with the return request, but no one called me back. I ended up buying another power card from home depot to complete the installation.This is my second purchase from Electronic express and on my first order of a refrigerator, I had experienced some issues with an internal tray damaged during their installation process and the replacement part was never sent back."

The price was better than Costco and the man told me I would get two sets of panels free. One comes with the refrigerator and then I submit one for rebate. He said stainless steel was unavailable and he didn\u2019t know when it would be back in stock. So I choose colors that they had in stock thinking I\u2019d get stainless when they\u2019re back. Well, after purchasing through a line of credit that I opened just for this purchase, I found out the man told me incorrect. After talking with two other electronic express sales man neither felt the need to make it right. One told me I could pay the difference and purchase an extra set of panels. Super frustrating since I was told they were free when I made my purchase (through a line of credit!!!!!!!!). When I finally decided to just cancel the order and shop somewhere else the man said ok like it was no big deal I was canceling my order. I went to Lowe\u2019s instead and bought a refrigerator and dishwasher from them. So much easier! Very frustrated I opened a line of credit through y\u2019all. Feel free to contact me to make it right!"

But I think a lot of the problems that we had was you had children working there it seems like it didn\u2019t look like they were over 16 years old. That being said, probably just not enough experience on solving problems yet. I guess it\u2019s all for the best though. It save me a lot of money, hindsight of not going in the store! Because I have a bad habit of spending a lot of money in electronic stores!!! Maybe you\u2019ll get the problem, resolved sometime in the future! Love the furniture ( $5,000 )! That I found out later same furniture for $3,000 was being sold at different companies. Sorry, we\u2019re Done!\ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab"

          "Contenu": "Delivery Service from Electronic Express was a hit and miss mess from Day One. There were some good parts and other (not so good) parts. We scheduled delivery of our kitchen package on Saturday, October 7 (stove, refrigerator, microwave and dishwasher).  We knew from the beginning that the microwave was backordered and would not be delivered at that time so that was expected.When the delivery team arrived, they set up the refrigerator with no issues. They then told me that they did indeed have a microwave on the truck so they brought it in and installed it.  They made a mess on my countertops drilling the holes in the cabinet above the stove to install the microwave and did not clean it up.They then brought in the dishwasher \u2013 after a few minutes, they called me into the kitchen and said that they could not install the dishwasher because they could not get my old dishwasher out because of the way my tile flooring was laid. I did see them yank on the dishwasher so I believed what they told me was accurate.That team left \u2013 I called the store immediately and spoke to William, the store manager who sold me the kitchen package.  I explained what they told me. He assured me that once I had the flooring issue resolved, I could reschedule the install (at no additional charge which was GREAT).While I was waiting on a contractor to come out and resolve the dishwasher issue, 2 issues happened.  First, we noticed a dent in the side of the new microwave that was delivered. I called and spoke to one of the salesmen in the store where I purchased. He referred me to the install department. They were great to offer a new microwave and scheduled a replacement to be delivered on November  18.The second issue was quite a bit more involved. When the techs attempted to remove my old dishwasher on the original install date of October 7, they unhooked the water and drain lines under my kitchen sink. When they couldn\u2019t install the new dishwasher, they did NOT reattach any of those lines. The undersink area flooded, soaked and damaged the wood under the sink. We did not notice it until a couple of days later when the wood was saturated and the water started to flow out onto the kitchen floor. We placed a catch basin under the drip and had to constantly deal with emptying that basin to prevent more damage.  I did not call and report that because I was so fed up and frustrated with the whole process. It took me four weeks to get a contractor to come out and look at the tile in front of the dishwasher and determine what needed to be done to get my old dishwasher out. It cost me $100 for them to tell me that all they had to do to get the old dishwasher out was to RAISE THE LEVELING LEGS, and it came right out.Needless to say, I was very disappointed that your installers apparently didn\u2019t think to try that. So, now that the dishwasher was removed and we were ready for the new dishwasher to be installed, I emailed home install and asked if the new dishwasher could be installed on the same service call as the replacement microwave on November 18. They told me that it would be no problem to amend the work order. When the installer came on November 18 \u2013 he installed the new microwave, had me sign that I accepted the delivery and started to leave. I asked about the dishwasher \u2013 he was very polite but said he did not have a work order for the dishwasher install. He left \u2013 I immediately called install, voiced my displeasure about having to wait for yet another appointment.  I was rescheduled for November 27 to get my dishwasher finally installed.The techs came on November 27 and installed my dishwasher finally.  The tech who installed the second microwave and the dishwasher (Nico) were very nice and did a great job. I have no problems with those 2 teams. The first team was disappointing. We will never buy anything from Electronic Express that has to be delivered and installed."

I also removed the two screws the installer was trying to drill into the underside of my granite counter top and used the installation holes provided on each side of the dishwasher to attach it to my cabinets.  This allowed me to level it better as well.  Still glad to have the installers unload it and place and make the original connections and haul-away my old one."

Second delivery attempt I took off work for and the refrigerator was left off the truck so a third delivery was necessary. An issue with the dishwasher was resolved during the second delivery.

They did not finish unpacking my dryer and the guys the second day left trash behind for me to throw away. So from here you can figure what was good and what we did not like. Forgot this part when we first called in the woman told us to take that cord back to the store and exchange for the correct cord, we told her they left no cord, and we had paid for delivery and hook up, her comment you can always get a cord."

The second delivery was somewhat disappointing because I had to leave my new refrigerator out on my back deck for a for days and was not able to get things hooked up or my old refrigerator disposed of. This was all due to the issue with me not having a shut off valve on the waterline running into the back of my old refrigerator. No blame but I had been without a proper working refrigerator for a few years now. I had my mind focused on a new up to date refrigerator of my choice. I think if you had someone that was more advanced with the installment process you would not have to turn the customer away because the delivery guy doesn't know how to install shut off valves. It's all a part of successfully installing refrigerators. There were a few bleeps with my delivery but accidents do happen. All in all I would still recommend purchasing electronic or appliances from Electronic Express. I plan to purchase items from Electronic Express in the near future. Thanks M and K Thomas"

Everyone was nice, the their ENTHUSIASM was low.  I told them from the start I knew exactly what I wanted and showed them the exact model and asked them NOT TO TRY TO SELL ME ANYTHING ELSE.  That did no good.They seemed all 4 or 5 of the employees, not to want to leave the cash register area and walk down to the TV's and then wanted to discuss other model.  I did not appreciate it, and reminded him NOT to make any suggestions.I told him I had 21 Samsung TV's in my last home and I loved them and have no interest in buying anything other than the model I showed him on my iPhone.  He back off and went to work.I wanted them delivered AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  And also wanted them installed if they had a day in the next few days, and if not my son-in-law would do it.  I didn't want him to have to as he is very busy. I reiterated whether or not they could install them I WANTED THEM DELIVERED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  It seemed to go in one ear and out the other.Now regarding the delivery.  I did get the TV's the following day.  The delivery guys came from North Carolina I believe he told me.  THEY WERE GREAT.  One of the guys carried a TV by himself (super strong) and handled himself and the other man was also a very good worker.  THEY DID A GREAT JOB.Back to the store associates for a moment.  I did witness a couple other customers come in.  One wanted a refund and another something else.  The team seemed to handle them fine.  That was nice.  They were very nice to me, JUST POOR LISTENERS.I would consider doing business with you again in the future, even though all of my electronics have come from BEST BUY.  I do appreciate convenience and your store in Gallatin is only a mile or two from me.One more thing.  Your questions below are crazy.  Why would you ask me which store.  You know the answer better than I do???Why would you ask me my name.  You also know that???More of a waste of my time and making me read a list of stores to click on.  Give your quiz some serious thought and learn from me only things you don't already know."

If PO box shipping is not allowed, a website will usually prevent the transaction.  This one did not. My package was shipped quickly but was held at my area UPS distribution center for days.  I kept checking the tracking, but it never moved.  There was no notification from UPS nor this retailer.  I finally contacted UPS and learned that my package couldn't go to my PO box, and I must make the 1 hour round trip to pick it up within the next 3 days.  This site should alert buyers to delivery options/problems."

Anyways I called FedEx and they came and picked up! It took 2 weeks for them to get it and credit back my financing! Meantime I went to electronic express website and ordered another one, it was $100 dollars more, but the other one was on sale for prime days, it came in a couple days in perfect condition! I love this tv and electronic express because, I called customer service within the 30 days to buy the warranty and they told me it was on sale for $200 less, so warranty was $100 less and, and, and they credited my financing $200 within minutes of the end of our call!!"
