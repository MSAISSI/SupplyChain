It is a pain, and I dont want to update my information on a bunch of account, but okay. I get it.  I updated my bank information for everything that is on autopayment with the newest information, and now everything is getting returned. My loan payments? Failed. My Condo Fees? Failed. I have hundreds in return check fees and late fees due, and I did everything to update the information.  Support? Useless. They keep telling me that i must not have updated the account information.  I did! I sent screen shots showing that I updated it.  The response? Well, you must not have updated your bank information.  Sent more screenshots!  The Response? Well, we dont see any problems on our side so I will forward the request to the bank. WTFFFFFFF. WHERE IS THE MONEY!?! What do you mean you are going to send the request to the bank?  that has been days ago, and people are reaching out saying I owe money.  Rent is due tomorrow, and will I get paid? Who knows? Maybe the money just disappears into thin air. WHERE IS MY MONEY AND WHY CANT I SPEND IT??"

A support call was scheduled, and the guy didn't show - got an email two hours later saying 'didn't feel well' and couldn't make it. I've received two unsolicitied sales calls from them and now **can't get them to close my account.** Total amateur site from start to finish. Can't reach them by telephone - infinite loop to a recording and leaving a message. Calls not returned. Like phoning a frat house rather than a business.update 13 May: my review was hidden for over a week after being flagged for being 'harmful or illegal.' The same day, the Baselane COO contacted me on my personal email, requesting a personal phone call to discuss ... what. This created a certain air of menace. A C-level executive, who once was a consultont for Boston Consulting Group. I replied I was confident my review reflected my experience and I would not retract it. Given his bizarre response, I again urge anyone seeking a rental management/payment system to look elsewhere. Or just use one of the no-fee cash-based payment apps."

          "Contenu": "Baselane is one of the worst disappointments I ever had in 10 years dealing with real estate.When I was first introduce to their customer service everything went really smooth and had daily follow ups with their team until I decided to move my portafolio to to be manage by this company, from that moment on the entire experience went sideways, my tenants reported to me they had to wait days to get their accounts confirm, from there setting up automatic payments took them weeks to manage, and to actually see funds almost a month!I expected this process to be \"normal\" as it was the first time setting up the accounts, but to my surprise the problems went on and on, the second red flag is when I first set an ACH to my insurance company, one of the \"benefits\" this company offered, to my surprise those payments were rejected due to a miss match of my name.After 1 week of daily emails, phone calls with their staff, the only response I got was that unfortunately they cannot ensure 100% of payments through them can be guarantee, I initially though the customer representative wasn't knowledgeable of this aspect so I requested to speak to their manager, and 3 days later I was told that at this moment this website does not have this capabilities, can you imagine setting up mortgage payments, contractors, insurance companies, or any other provider that relies on the efficiency of this system and been told that even the CEO of the company did not find a way to ensure payments were set up reliable! Well I learn this the hard way and to put this in context I only moved 5 properties at the time, for those with larger portafolio be aware of this limitations upfront and avoid a headache."

          "Contenu": "UPDATED: Revising from 1 to 4 stars. See original review below due to two factors. First, the account was magically opened a week or so after I wrote this. Then a few days later, one of their Customer Support Team people I was working with wrote a very detailed explanation and apology for the way this was handled. We did a call regarding the matter and she went over all of the steps in which the process failed on their end, as well as the ways in which they are going to use this experience to improve their service. Given how rarely this happens nowadays that any company takes responsibility and action in such a transparent way, we're going to go ahead and set up our Baselane account. Completely incompetent. We are a self-managed HOA that was really excited about the prospect of using a single platform integrated with banking for our needs. It took them SIX WEEKS to 'review' our application for a bank account. After multiple escalations and explanations they requested the same exact documents which we told them we do not have (as in they do not exist because of our formation status). Pretty much forced us to waste all that time. The negative review is not because they declined to open the account (although we have had no issue opening bank accounts with the same documentation in the past.) It's because of the length of time this took and the total lack of even so much as a boilerplate apology in the end. In reply to my final email to them asking to explain how on earth we landed right back to where we started, I got \"I'm going to go ahead and close this conversation for housekeeping \ud83d\ude0a.\" I wouldn't trust them with anything."

I\u2019ve already received cash back for home improvement purchases and enjoy the high APY. The website is intuitive, but the mobile experience could be expanded as not all features are available through it and I rarely use my laptop. There should be a way to filter out external accounts from the net cash flow analysis because it makes the data inaccurate and is frustrating. Despite these flaws, I trust that the company will make improvements. I love the fact that I can customize rent payments as it lets me charge tenants one time fees. Tenants seem to have an easy time on boarding as well. I have not reached out to customer service yet so I cannot speak to the experience. Overall, highly recommended, and have already invited friends to the platform."

          "Contenu": "I've been trying to get my mortgage approved and one of the statements my lender requires is a copy of my Baselane statement. Turns out, Baselane is just a software service and banks with Blue Ridge Bank. Which means my lender will not accept Baselane's statement and will only accept a statement with Blue Ridge Bank's logo and URL.I've contacted support many many times over 2 weeks with customer service rep Eric. Eric told me they'd look into it -- no follow up in 1 week. Then I followed up again to give them instructions on what I need on the statement. Eric told me he'd contact Blue Ridge Bank -- nothing. I followed up multiple times after that, and Eric stopped responding. I called 3 times in the course of 1 week, at different times, and was sent to voicemail every. single. time.As a software made for landlords, I imagine I'm not the only one who's applying to mortgages. If I can't even get a legitimate statement from Baselane, why would I use your platform?Potential users looking to sign up: Don't. You'll get poor customer serviceUPDATE: Baselane took care of this problem in the end. Larissa from the Customer Success team was very helpful and helped me resolve this issue as soon as she found out. Originally gave a 1 star review but changing it to 4. I wish we never had this problem but their team did a great job managing it afterwards."
