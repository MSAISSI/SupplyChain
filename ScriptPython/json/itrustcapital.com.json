Their KYC has been showing up error for a couple of days now and I am afraid that they might be insolvent. I have been trying to reach out to them but one guy tells me my request has been sent to the engineers and no response thereafter."

Hopefully, such things like this will never happen again, because it was a long scary week for all of us, and we thought all our savings would be lost. In addition, they also don't have any capability of allowing us users the safely secure any crypto stock to a wallet or hardware device for safekeeping like a Ledger. If they have another shutdown like before, your crypto stock and retirement savings could be lost for good. The only thing I like about them is that they have a 1% fee on purchases. But other than this, their service and interface is very lacking."

The worst part is that when you talk to any reps its like talking into the wind. iTrust is going to make there money regardless but its still early in this game and hopefully the future brings us an entity that listens to the customer more. Also you can forget about referral rewards they want you to open an account with a particular service in order to get it. They probably get paid by them to gain users. I already have Paypal which is one of the ones they list as using but they wanted me to open an account with the other one they use. Why couldn't I get it with the one I already have! Just when I thought I was done in order to wright this review they will automatically create an account for me with Trustpilot. Great!"

Either by coinbase's mistake, iTrustCapital's mistake, or third parties. If they lose it, It's just gone and thats that.iTrustCapitals Terms of Service is dodgy at best. Their faq's are crafted to impress on the customer a safe investment experience, when that couldn't be further from the truth.Only cash held at iTrustCapital is FDIC insured. If any loss of customers crypto happens, TOS says iTrustCapital may only be liable for damages up to $100. I was keeping more than $100 on their platform.I left because of the above risk. Thats way way too much risk for me to keep any crypto on their platform.This platform is 'Not your keys, not your crypto.' which is never ok unless there is a third party insurance option protecting against complete loss by all and any parties.I did notice a few other red flags:1. Their spread is huge on top of high transactional fees.2. Their platform is bare bones basic and it doesn't look like they've made any considerable investment into it, giving me the impression its a fly by night operation.3. Selling on their platform was suspiciously unavailable at critical times during the last crash (but that was probably coinbase's doing)."

I don\u2019t normally write reviews but people should be warned.Once they have your money they don\u2019t respond to emails for support and if you try to call you get a queue.  Once you make it to the top of the queue an automated voice says they aren\u2019t taking calls and it hangs up on you. I have no problem with a queue, the fact the system hangs up on you stating \"we are not taking calls at this time\" is a problem after waiting in a queue for 30 minutes. It keeps stating my credentials are wrong but they are not as I've been using saved credentials (username/password). I try to reset password and they are supposed to send an email.  The email doesn't come and I've tried a dozen times with different devices.I\u2019ve had at least 10 issues with my account since inception a year ago.  Most have to do with inability to log into account through any format (app, phone, computer, safari or chrome). On days the market is eventful are the days you cannot get into your trading account and screwed you out of thousands of dollars.  I've been unable to log in since Monday with NO RESPONSE but they respond here immediately! What a jokeThey\u2019ve also been hacked once and customers have lost access to their account for over a week When I eventually get into my account I plan on moving my money to a reputable IRA and not a scam like this one"

          "Contenu": "IT seems iTrust Capital has a hard time processing distributions.  This is the 3rd time I have had a distribution.  The first time took 3-4 weeks.  The second time with Jared Feldman hand holding the process, has completed in about 2 weeks.  Now again with this distribution it has already been 20 days for a simple cash distribution.  Their documentation on the support website states 7-10 days from when the documentation is signed.  That was 16 days ago and it has been 10 days since I had a verification call.  I was told it would only take 3-5 days.  The company is very good about doing everything they can to get your money, but has very poor customer service when you try to get it back.Update:  As the distribution was only completed today after this review and several emails, I find it odd iTrust Capital feel the a request made on 12 days after the verification call and 19 days after the request meets the 7-10 days statements on the support page.  The only time iTrust met this time period was while Jared was hand holding my send distribution. Read through the 1 and 2 start review.  This is a common theme for trying to reach support for a distribution."

Why use it if it doesn\u2019t work as explained in their videos?I was subsequently told by Trent, that the Conditional Transaction feature is not the same as a limit order.Then say so on your 2 videos explaining the Conditional Trade feature to your users!  I mean, am I wrong?ITrustCapital puts itself first by being intentionally deceptive.  They are only interested in attracting your business and charging you a hefty commission.As a customer my expectations are reasonable: TransparencyTrustHonesty & Integrity.ITrustCapital failed on my Conditional Buy Orders and then failed to make me whole.Not the kind of experience a customer expects.  Particularly with the current FTX insolvency debacle where customer trust has never been more important. Trent didn\u2019t even have the stones/courtesy to return my call, but instead sent me an email response stating they address the Conditional Trade features inability to do as they claim/advertise (see both of their videos) in the FAQ.Deceptive and untrustworthy.ITrustcapital\u2018s behavior is exemplary of what will cause excessive government intrusion/oversight/regulation to the crypto ecosystem - limiting the benefit of decentralization.Makes you wonder, what else is bogus with ITrustcapital?"

These reviews were not accurate at all as this is the worst customer service I've ever encountered.Update - I did receive a phone call last night and hope to get the issues I've been experiencing resolved.Additional update 5/3/21 - After posting this review, I received another phone call from iTrustCapital.  They offered to waive their monthly fee for several months and asked that I change my negative review.  Since they didn't act on my issue of losing the original deposit of $50,000 for 7 weeks, I waited to see how that would turn out.  I sent them a lengthy message with details provided to me by Fidelity and never received a response from them - nothing - crickets.  So, I did not change my review as they asked and they did not waive the monthly charge as they said they would.  I have since transferred my money back to Fidelity and closed the iTrustCapital account.   Sure, their fees are less than others but you get what you pay for."

I accept this explanation.  This of course would not have helped the funding, but does help me to understanding what I was experiencing.  I will keep my account and make a final decision for addition deposits.  The promise of improvements and additional features will help"

          "Contenu": "Awful. After much research in the digital asset community, and based on recommendations from many, I started the process of funding my account in Oct 2020. This involved a rollover from a Roth IRA with Ellevest (managed by Folio). After submitting all the necessary paperwork on my end, I waited for my account to be funded. I waited. Then I waited some more. After 3 weeks of watching the market start the bull run, my account was still not funded. I had hoped to allocate around $2200 to XRP. I called iTrust. They blamed Folio and said they had no record of a transfer. After hours and hours on the phone with Ellevest and Folio, it was discovered that iTrust NEVER submitted the paperwork. They straight up lied to me. It doesn't stop there. I asked for proof that they submitted the transfer paperwork and do you know what they said? They don't keep fax copies longer than 14 days. Convenient right? And it still gets worse. They charge me a one month fee, even though I had a promo code for the first month free. Not only was that not applied, but they charged me for never doing their job! I lost huge potential gains, and still iTrust has never admitted their mistake. To add insult to injury, the customer experience manager, Anthony...never replied to my email asking to refund the first month fee. Nothing was done in order to make the situation right. They simply ignored me. I watch Anthony go on many programs on YouTube...he is incredibly great at marketing iTrust. Yet, he won't return an email despite his title being about the \"customer experience.\" I followed up with him and asked that my monthly fees be waived for 6 months. He replied that he would waive 3 months of fees. I am honestly blown away that a business handling part of my digital assets would be so incompetent, not take ownership of a mistake, and ignore their customers. Beware, this company is great at taking your money, but God forbid you ask them to do their job, and you will hear radio silence. STAY AWAY!"

The day after, got an email with links to questions I posed when I set up appointment and a voice message with rushed attempt to answer questions. No acknowledgement about reason why initial phone appointment was missed. No biggie if you at least acknowledge. Not acknowledging the missed appointment even superficially and that I was (wasting my time) waiting around for nothing was definitely off for me customer-service wise. I replied back to email to ask if I could speak to someone else. Got this reply: \"You can schedule a call anytime on our website but please only do so if necessary, we are short on time slots.\" I understand y'alls busy ITrust, we all are. Sounds like you'd rather not have me call?From my vantage point, the initial missed phone call, with no notice, follow-up or acknowledgement ended up getting worse.  I'm a fairly chill and not one for writing up these reviews.  Hope you had a better experience with getting your money right with this group and building that sense of trust. Hope your customer service was more on point and communication wasn't this hasty and off-putting sequence I got the last 24 hours.  I am putting my app on hold after this.[IN RESPONSE TO ITRUST BELOW]I did not receive a phone call the evening of the scheduled call. I was there waiting for the phone call, emailed the rep 2x (with no response) indicating I was waiting.  I did receive a voice mail and email the next day as I noted above.  I can understand things get busy and given the current state of matters, things can fall through the cracks sometimes.  I'm sure you have great service as evidenced by your previous reviews. I am noting the truth of my experience: missed appointment, no acknowledgement of said missed appointment, voicemail next day, email with links, questionable response: \"You can schedule a call anytime on our website but please only do so if necessary, we are short on time slots.\"My scheduled call was from 4:50pm to 5:00pm. I was on my phone waiting for the call before 4:50pm and stay until 5:10pm waiting for scheduled call.  I emailed employee 2x during this time indicating I was waiting for the call."

Today (10/13/22) from 0600-1500 eastern time. I could get in to the site but it showed an asset value of 0.00. So it looked like my account had been cleaned out.  BTC was not viable at all!! The buy/sell buttons were there for the assets but they would not work. This all happened while BTC dipped back around 18k and I wanted DCA in but was unable to. I am on the east coast so I had to wait until 0800 PST, which equates to abut 5 hours, before I could reach out to customer service/tech support.  Very scary and very disappointing. Crypto is a 24/7-365 day a year thing. I wish that these businesses would recognize that they can't keep bankers hours when in business with crypto. We really need support 24/7. Still have not gotten a response from the company explaining what/why and how this was possible. Was I the only one?"

They probably don\u2019t keep any crypto themselves anyway just like FTX or any other fraud company.  I\u2019m creating a taxable event and moving to cold storage so I don\u2019t lose everything with this SBF style company.FOLLOW UP 12/5/22So I have attempted to get a crypto withdrawal and iTrust has claimed my form was completed wrong after taking almost a week to review it and disabled my login credentials so I cannot even \u201ccorrect\u201d it.  It is starting to feel like my \u201caccount balance\u201d shown by iTrust may not be reality.  I hope they actually hold of mine what they claim to hold and this is not another Ponzi scheme.  Only time with tell.  I wonder if I own any crypto purchased through iTrust.UPDATE 12/7/22I was sent an email late 12/5/22 saying there was a problem with the system and to log in and redo my distribution form, so I did.  As of 12/7/22, I have not received any acknowledgment that my form was viewed, accepted, or rejected.  I guess I am just waiting on someone to say something.  But I\u2019m expecting another \u201cdiscrepancy\u201d or other reason they won\u2019t be able to process my withdrawal.UPDATE 12/14/22So I finally had my verification call on 12/12 and completed it but still no distribution.  So now, I am three weeks in and nothing but hope.  If it does end up being legitimate, I a) hope they aren\u2019t stealing from other account holders to distribute to me as occurs under normal ponzi circumstances, and b) think that 3-4 weeks to take distribution for a crypto asset that takes 30-60 minutes to transfer is RIDICULOUS.  STAY AWAY FROM THEM!  NOT YOUR KEYS, NOT YOUR COINS!UPDATE 12/17/22Still nothing but I am told that it happens within 7-14 business days of when I signed my pdf, which was 12/5/22.  So that would be between 12/14 and 12/26.  We will see.UPDATE 12/20/22Still nothing.  It is amazing that it is taking so long.  Absolutely ridiculously.UPDATE 12/20/22 (later in the day)I received my Bitcoin transfer.  I\u2019m glad that it happened and I got out.  Also glad that while the process was painful, I got the end result I wanted.  Changing my review to 2 stars because at least I got my crypto out."

          "Contenu": "iTrustCapital has deceptive pricing policies and, IMO, seems to take advantage of people who don't know the difference between conditional and limit orders. First, iTrustCapital states that they charge 1% per transaction. Yes, they charge 1% per transaction and that is true! What they DO NOT tell you is that it is a 1% transaction on top of padding the spot price. I'll use BTC for this entire post, but the same goes for any of iTrustCapital's digital assets. For BTC this pad is usually around $25~50 and varies for other digital assets. This is easy to see if you compare the iTrustCapital price of BTC with the spot price of BTC. Google it. So, iTrustCapital are pocketing the spread from their pricing versus spot pricing. Why not just say that in the pricing page? It's disingenuous at best and certainly not clearly stated. From their fee structure page: What are iTrustCapital\u2019s fees? Monthly account cost: $0Cryptocurrency Trades: 1%Physical Gold: $50 over spot per ouncePhysical Silver: $2.50 over spot per ounceNote that for gold and silver they do tell you they pad the spot price, but make no mention of it for cryptocurrency. Additionally, I believe that iTrustCapital aims to take advantage of people who don't know how different kinds of orders work. iTrustCapital has two kinds of orders: market and conditional. Everyone knows what a market order is, but generally people think conditionals are limit orders. They are not. A limit order fills at a price that you pre-determine. If you put a limit buy order for BTC to fill at $20,101.01 and BTC moves to that price, you will buy BTC at $20,101.01, not a cent more or less. A conditional on the other hand is sent as a market order when pricing meets the conditions you set. If you put in a conditional order to buy BTC at $20,101.01, when BTC gets to that price your order will get sent out as a market order. Meaning, you will end up paying something different than your conditional buy price. It can be vastly different in volatile markets. For example, BTC could be at $21,000 and wick down to your conditional price. Your order will be sent out as a market order. If BTC instantly wicks back up, you might end up buying BTC for a substantially higher amount. In another example, say you have set a conditional sell order to be a stop loss in the event of a black swan event. When BTC gets down to your backstop, your order will be sent out. In the meantime, BTC could wick down and you could be filled at hundreds or thousands less than you had intended. I have explained this many times to many people who believe that conditional orders are limit orders. No investor in their right mind would ever use a market order. In this day and age of corporate malfeasance, and bad actors such as the people involved with FTX, companies who care will do a lot more to make people trust them. It's an easy fix for iTrustCapital. 1) Clearly state in their fee structure that they pad the spot price of cryptocurrencies. 2) Clearly explain that iTrustCapital DOES NOT USE limit orders and that conditionals are very different. 3) Give their customers limit orders."

A pie chart of your holdings by percentage would be much more efficient then your bar design for each asset. I would also add a field for the total P&L so users can see account performance at a glance vs only their account balance. Another idea would be to add a user chat forum. Itrust users could share trading strategies and and other market information. This could possibly encourage more trading activity and fees for Itrust. Please feel free to contact me for any further ideas to improve the user experience.Thanks,Ryan S"

Scheduled calls are only 5 minutes, so be ready and don't forget to ask anything or it's another 1-week wait for you.4) You can email their support team, which is the fastest way to get in touch, but responders frequently don't fully answer questions, so it will take multiple email exchanges to get support.5) Their 'corporate' office address is a rent-a-room office building. Their 'mailing' address is box at a UPS Store."

          "Contenu": "First, the rollover process was absolutely horrible. My check was mailed to you and received on a Wednesday morning, you said it would be processed after a 3day hold or something. well by Friday it still had not even been processed and the 3-day timer did not start. I didn't have access to my money for almost two weeks after you received it. I had two accounts a ROTH an a traditional, and the traditional was held up even longer and I was not able to start trading. the prices during that time when I was not able to trade were the lowest during the bear market and I lost the opportunity to captilize on the price. So that was my first expereince with your company and the based on the calls with your staff I was left feeling regret having sent my funds to your platform. Now that I have been using it, one feature you need to add is the ability to set multiple conditional orders, and the ability to dollar cost average into assets. You should allow multiple conditional buy and sell orders on the same coin. Also need the ability to see the average price per coin bought and show better performance analysis and reports. overall portfolio performance, individual coin performance, etc."

Dissatisfied that email communications took over 72 hours. That is not an acceptable response time. There was no phone number provided to call until after I asked for one. I requested a call back online and that took over 3 days. This could have easily been prevented had staff taken time to resolve the issue and spend a little more time on the process. Other than that my trades have gone well and the monthly fee and 1% trade fees are competitive. Think they are extremely busy and short staffed. They have assured me they are working on hiring and training. However thay does not replace the three days of trading that was missed while BTC hit ATH. Has yet to return to pre funding day levels. Not too excited about that."

As far as once the money is there, and the ease of using the system, they are good, but being in limbo and not knowing where several thousand dollars are can be stressful, and I would have hoped for better customer service.Update:  Over 4 weeks now and still they can't find my $6,000 I sent.  I've had to send emails and messages through their system several times, repeating myself because I've been passed onto another customer service rep.  I only started getting feedback once I used a direct email that I had in the past to another employee (the automated system may have just been redirecting my comments to an unassigned box, I don't know).  I hope they resolve this soon, but I've missed the BTC dip because of all of this."

The available tokens to trade are very limited. This is not coinbase. Plus you cannot make limit orders which means you probably pay the highest market price. Customer service is unresponsive to email requests. You need to make a phone appointment?!!  I think they are overwhelmed and one has to wonder why. The platform is decent and simple but I am waiting for something more advanced and lower cost. This is not a good option for active trading in my opinion. Look before you leap._________________________post review comments:After posting my review I received an immediate  phone call on my mobile from itrust and a message that basically said my review was not true and that I should go setup an account somewhere else. Not sure why someone would feel the need to call me at night on 12/30 with an attitude. My motivation is simple - to help make your company be better. That you would act so defensive is disturbing. First off, you send me an email asking for my review, I give you 2 stars then you ask for comments, I give you my honest feedback, then you question MY motivations?!!  So if a review is less than stellar, you attack? Not a smart strategy. The entire response misses the point and is misleading. I did not say your 1% fee was non-competitive - I said it seemed excessive. I did not say I could not trade on the account, I have of course place some buy orders. I did not say anything about stop orders - which are for stop loss selling, not buying. Limit buy orders are what I mentioned. Perhaps you do not know the difference or maybe just respond with robotic scripts like the emails you said I received. Please do not  play this game. I am only trying to help."

But my concern is that this is a CARES withdrawal, which I specified in my previous requests, and the CARES act is about to expire. What happens if you still don't get to process this request before the expiration date? I shouldn't be penalized (due to your delay) since I made the request way before the expiration date, right?\"I never got a response on this.Why can't I withdraw my money?? At least post the instructions and forms on your website so customers can initiate the withdrawal process. How long and how hard is it to send instructions and forms??The lack of communication and professionalism is very frustrating, and all I am requesting is a withdrawal which I believe should not even take this long. Especially during this time when it is really needed.In the beginning, they were very professional in taking my money. But now that I desperately need it and ask for it, they won't even give me the time and day and ignore my request.UPDATE:12/31/2020 - Received the requested funds.

After completing the forms and instructions for a transfer on their website, I got an email telling me to keep a close eye on my account messages and email inbox over the next 1-3 business days to DocuSign a couple of documents. 2 full weeks later I hadn't received anything, so I sent a message to customer support. To their credit, that same day I got a message back that the documents don't actually arrive via email (despite what the earlier email said) and that they're ready for me to sign. I had just checked my account messages prior to reaching out, so it's clear that my note to them is what prompted the documents suddenly being ready. Fine, at least they were ready. I signed what needed to be signed, carefully read over everything to see if any further action would be needed from me, didn't see anything, and so expected to see the transfer show up in 3-5 business days. I gave it 9 business days before getting in touch again. 2 days later I got a message that a transfer form needed to be filled out. Again, nothing in the two previous rounds of paperwork mentioned this, and I had already provided the account number and institution name that the funds would be transferring from in the earlier paperwork. Fine. I filled out the transfer form. 5 days later I sent another message to customer service, as I hadn't seen any movement on either the iTrust account or the funding account, and by now I was starting to feel that the only way the next step in the process was triggered was by me pinging customer service. Sure enough, suddenly the transfer started 2 days later. I waited the 5 business days that I was seeing the (pending) notation on the funding account. 2 business days ago, the money showed as settled on the funding account side, and was gone from that account. I logged on to iTrust and it still showed as pending. I waited 2 days to give them the benefit of the doubt. Today it's still pending on their side, and settled and gone from the funding side. I reached out again today, but I'm tired of having to do this for every single step. They don't seem to have a process in place where one completed event triggers the next, and things only happen when I send a message. It could be worse, at least so far sending a message has made things happen. My advice is to be proactive and don't assume that finishing one task will prompt the next to begin."

I found out about them from one of their affiliates that pushes this as a way to trade tax free, but without these tools, unless you want to sit and watch the market 24/7, you really cannot do this. If staking starts within a few months I would probably give another star. For what it is it works, they appear to be the most competitively priced, even with their wide spreads on market orders and I will use them for now.Average product."

The email said it would be \"3 business days\" before I could actually start buying assets through iTC.  3 busness days came and went, and I wasn't able to buy anything.  It took almost a month of emails with 3 or 4 different iTC CSRs before I was actually able to buy the assets I wanted for my Roth IRA.

Then when you go to sell the price is lower than everyone including their own buy price. So you are taking loss buying and selling over and above the 1% fee!!!! Not to mention they sell you on 24/7 account access. But you can\u2019t set buys and sells you have to do all buys and sells in person. So you have to be awake and on the site 24/7.

          "Contenu": "I am based out of New York, and iTrustCapital (iTC) came highly recommended to me. I think they are a good and solid company although nearly two years ago; being based out of New York and having my funds sitting in the cryptocurrency XRP; due to some highly questionable tactics done by the SEC to file charges against members of the company Ripple, it likely contributed to iTC stopping its support of the token a couple years back for NY and Hawaii residents given the regulatory uncertainty that it created here in the United States which in turn forced me to have to make the tough decision of having to transfer my funds out to another custodian or have the funds automatically liquidated which I didn't want to do. I also had to take an early distribution on another token I received for holding XRP which I also didn't want to do but is something that I view largely to be the fault of the SEC's actions rather than iTC.Now that the SEC has largely lost in its absurd case against Ripple; and given iTC's move to a new custodian that once again supports XRP as a token; I've made the decision to come back to the platform and hope that nothing rash like what happened with XRP happens again in the future as that would force me to permanently leave the platform the second time around as it was an unpleasant experience having to move the funds back and forth and dealing with some delays which has costed me greatly in terms of lost opportunities over the past couple of years on top of the various fees and taxes that I will be assessed for all the movements. The saving grace through all of this frustration has been the positive experiences that I've had with various members of iTC's service team who are dedicated and genuinely want to help. I most recently had the pleasure of dealing with Nadia who provided me with frequent updates on the progress of my in-kind transfer back into my account. Support at iTC is consistent, and you will typically get a response within 24 hours, and most will go out of their way to provide you with a straight answer rather than just a cookie cutter response that ultimately goes nowhere."

In the matter of a day the whole situation had been resolved.  I am very satisfied at the customer support and white glove service that was given by Jared.  I have changed my rating and updated this post to reflect.Original Post:I have been trying to track my transfer out to a different IRA.  Which has been apparently mailed out almost a month ago.  My new custodian has not seen the check yet.  I have contacted support a couple times and gotten different stories as to the dates and even where the transfer was being sent.  I have asked for a tracking # to see where the check would be with nothing but crickets.  This is ridiculous and makes me wonder why I am keeping my Roth with them still."

Staking is income that should not be foregone. Roth IRA conversion took a couple days longer than promised, during which time I was unable to trade. I have asked for transaction records on my Roth IRA conversion, not immediately available. I expect all these will be taken care of with extra diligence on my part."

Kudos to Anthony, who ensured prompt routing of my rollover check once he received it from UPS. Adam was cordial and ensured that I new the approximate time and date my funds would be available, and he was spot on. And last but certainly not least, the most interactive and caring of all was Jared, who coddled me through the entire process as if I were a close family member, and he should be commended, deserving all accolades available to bestow on him. I'm more than satisfied with my iTrust experience to date and would recommend them to anyone seeking a comfortable retirement haven. From a Retired U.S Marine, OOHRAH and SEMPER FI iTrust Team!"
