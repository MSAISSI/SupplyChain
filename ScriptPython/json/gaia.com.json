          "Contenu": "I highly suggest steering clear of Gaia. I joined last month and was charged 3 times for 1 billing period.  I emailed the company and instead of working with me to find a solution they discontinued my account and have not responded to any of my emails.  They did refund me for 1 of the 3 charges they took from my account however I think $30 (the cost of 2 months of subscription in a perfect world) is a bit steep for the 3 days I was able to access the site.  Absolutely horrible customer service if you can even call it that."

          "Contenu": "A streaming spiritual platform is great and they deliver on that, 5 star there. However, good luck if you ever need customer service. I was double charged for months and still havent been helped to get it resolved. Paying for the service via apple subscriptions then randomly charged again by Gaia.com. They dont have a customer service number so you submit issues via a bot and hope someone will get back to you. At the end of the day the product is great but the service is poor and thats enough for me to not use again."

Sure there is small print stating they would be recharging every month but this is not always clear. They can see if I had not used it in the months I was overcharged but refunded to give me my money back. I have been a loyal annual subscriber in the past but now they will never get another penny off me. Their customer service is as poor as their business strategy if they think this is an acceptable way to retain annual subscribers."

Now if I don't keep my basic subscription they will not reimburse me my money They took for an upgrade I did not sign up for. That's sad...just another controlled platform."

Mainstream, accepted science. And yet you won't hear anything about these discoveries from long-regarded journals or media outlets.

I immediately cancelled the description but it's another Amazon et al scam that makes you sign up for a free trial but does not advise or warn of an impending bill. This unethical behaviour makes me resent everything that comes from America, especially your spelling. If a company is unethical about it's billing, I suspect the integrity and veracity of it's information."

Most of the material that is uniquely Gaia's is outlandish, and conspiracy theory related. Fun to visit occasionally, but not worth a membership. My spouse was really curious about Gaia, so I purchased the annual membership, which is more than $44 less than purchasing it monthly. I was not impressed with the material, and decided to cancel after 3 months. I was informed on their website that they wouldn't refund me for the unused 9 months, but that I still had to keep the membership. In their words, \"rest assured, you will have access until the year membership ends.\" Wow, thanks Gaia, I can access your website that I don't want to access because you won't determine the prorated amount for a proper refund. The other streaming websites will let you cancel, so I am unsure why a streaming platform that claims to be spiritually guided adheres to capitalism 101, instead. If I could give 0 stars, that would be the real review.When I contacted customer service, they repeatedly quoted their website that they don't issue any partial refunds and that I had to keep the service. When I asked to speak to management, the request was ignored, multiple times"

I was under the impression that I did not have access to Gaia all this time due to the emails I received!  I sent them an email about it requesting a refund of everything they have automatically taken out of my account that was not authorized.  They sent this to me in response: \"Please note that Amazon Video is a separate membership to Gaia. It is a separate subscription, billed separately from Gaia.com offerings.  I understand your situation and as a one-time courtesy, we would be glad to refund your account for the last charge. Your account has been canceled and your refund will be processed by our team within the next 48 hours.SO, just the \"last charge\" as a \"one-time-courtesy\"?  I cannot believe a \"spiritual\" business is operating this way!  A courtesy would have been to not take any additional money from me after I cancelled!"

Having said that, each of these shows needs a new host. While the content is interesting, each of these hosts never stops talking long enough for their guest(s) to speak and so it becomes a monologue of Regina interviewing herself, or George himself.A season 5 of Ancient Civilizations would be something that might make me keep my GAIA Membership longer.

Viewers are assured of an impending apocalypse through a solar flash and salvation through ascension. All detractors of the official narrative are deemed \"haters.\" Do we really need a new corporate religion?"

Since I'm new to what is scientific, I might not know how to express myself as coherently as someone else. But the need for understanding science in a realistic way is what drives me to be passionate about the subject.

For instance, Jason Rice, Corey Goode and Emery Smiths\u2019 clams;  Sounds like a conglomeration of every scifi movie from the last  80 years.  Although it\u2019s entertaining and peppered with some truths I suspect, i feel their explanations for EVERYTHING extraterrestrial is just not plausible. I try to remain open minded, but people who talk about \u201cfacts\u201d MUST be able to back up their claims. This is not happening."

So much remains for Gaia to promote about our interstellar universe and much more along such lines, but is most definitely not being pursued.  Customer support is also completely non-existent.  Worse than disgusting.  People with first hand experience about our SSP and IDARF are no longer sought out and interviewed in depth as previously, instead replaced by the imaginary beliefs of self-proclaimed \"experts\" who present nothing more than unproven, unreferenced personal opinions.  Such can be found everywhere."

I have no interest in the yoga and drug shows that are so heavy in the lineup.  I suggest you find more ways to incorporate Christians into your wonderful information.  Dr Joye Pugh would be wonderful for a show.  I spent hours last year watching and this year maybe 4 hours a week.  I always watch Cosmic Disclosure and Wisdom Teachings but the price is high for 2 shows.  Vibratory information is vital now and we need your help to implement it.  Try to bring in people who can incorporate beliefs and not destroy baselines.  Good luck!  I wish I could help.  Your shows have been a great blessing to me and my learning experiences.

Unfortunately, no new content has been added to this category in way over a year. Due to covid, I am no longer able to pay for their monthly service. I put my subscription on hold for 3 months in hopes of acquiring new employment and thus being able to resume my subscription. I was charged for the following month when it was suppose to be on hold. Their no refund policy is anything but fair. I recently cancelled an online course I paid for costing approximately $1200.00. I was over the cancellation period and was worried I would not receive a refund. The company immediately issued a refund, offered a huge discount on my next online course and wished me well. Thats the kind of service you would expect from a \"spiritually\" based company like Gaia not NO REFUND. Furthermore, since my cancellation of their service, every time I'm online, thats all I see is targeted adds from Gaia. Obviously, I have experienced targeted adds before. It's the huge number of adds I find astonishing. I will not be renewing my Gaia subscription."

I either get a message saying the service is \"temporarily unavailable\" or the little star that spins while content is loading just sits there & spins & spins & spins & the show fails to stream. I called customer support & they have absolutely no explanation as to why it won't stream or any guarantees it will be fixed. I asked to speak to someone who would know those answers & apparently nobody in the company does. That's sad! They don't seem to care very much about customer support. They did offer me 2 free months of service which I turned down. What good is free service if it doesn't work? I cancelled. I advise others to stay away from the service until they get their act together which it doesn't seem like they're very interested in doing."

They have not anything really good for awhile.Not a lot of quality for awhile.Need more depth with more interesting expert presenters, like Billy Carson, Freddy Silva, Gregg Braden. Also Gaia needs to dump some boring films and get a lot of good ones--so many mediocre films and hardly ever new ones. Also I was very disappointed when they took away all the dates on their inteviews and programs leaving no idea when they were made.Also I think they should set up a system so folks can watch one Event and not have to get the entire season of lectures. I think they would make more money and get many new subscribers for Gaia.In general I am disappointed in the programming this past year--not as diverse, indepth, creative or interesting. Also Ancient Civilizations could be much better--too many interviewees and not enough depth. It is alittle of this and that--the speakers say alittle then on to another speaker . It is too general, could have much more depth. Need more top line interesting series and speakers. For awhile programming has seemed C quality. Nothing to learn deeply from--time for new fresh quality programs."

So the level of difficulty which should be the most useful filter is actually useless.Other than that, I like the instructors and the fact that I can choose what length of class or what area I want to focus on."

The add states that you get 12 months for the price of 9 months for the annual subscription cost of $99.00. Well I am no mathematician by any means but I can add. So if you add sales tax to the $99.00 it totals $107.17 and if you multiply the monthly subscription cost of $11.99 by 9 months plus tax the cost is $116.82.  So by this calculation the annual subscription is the best deal, but don't say that it is 12 months for the price of 9 whenever it is clearly not. That's all I am saying here.Thank you"

Shows are not grouped together as they should be and finding certain items can be frustrating. Overall, Gaia is my go to for enlightening content and self help items. That said, the presentation and functionality of the channel could use a facelift. Super happy I subscribed Gaia, it has literally been life changing for me. Thank you!"

Im not sure how else to describe but it in a rhythmic pattern will zoom in and magnify just a portion of the screen before bouncing back out to the full screen as it should be... seconds later it does it again. repeat. never ends. have to close out Gia and relaunch.

They use series and episode numbers, but unlike TV series and episodes, there is no release date associated with them.Gaia claims the dates do not matter because the content is relevent regardless, and in some instances this is true, but in other instances it is not. It is odd that Gaia is on the cutting edge in the Disclosure movement, but will not disclose to the public when their videos were made. Still the subscription is well worth it, and Gaia has some outstanding video series, most notably Matias DeStefano and Emery Smith, and especially Emery Smith with Capt. Randy Cramer."

His story touched me a lot and his series with very different guests always are riveting. I still have a question mark about his identity as in many series his appearance is quite different, like we see a \"clone\" of him... Having quite a deep understanding concerning evolution on this planet and the links planet Earth has with other worlds, I am very interested to listen to people having experiences with other forms of life. So my gratitude to you Gaia for daring to present programmes that allow us to discover or deepen our own understanding and to keep an open mind on such fascinating subjects. However, we cannot forget that there is a profound logic in all concerning the universe and the evolution of all living beings. We have a huge capacity for learning and evolving. We don't have to rely on machines all the time; our Mind can do a very good job if we make the effort."

The setting needs to be constantly reset over different viewing sessions.5) \"Accept cookies\" question is a permanent feature. It doesn't respond and disappear with an answer - it's a permanent feature of logging in, every single time. If it weren't for the above, Gaia definitely rates 5 stars!!!  ...offering a veritably lifelong cornucopia of incredibly valuable, uplifting, informative, professional videos.

However, I think their website could be better and i'd like to be able to see older possibly archived episodes of Georgie Noory's show.  He references them sometimes but then I can't find them.  For example, the guy who was able to make a watch stop on tv and consequently watches that were \"watching\" also stopped.  I'd love to see that.  Also, I find that the format is the same old same old on the website.Finally,  at the end of the day, I really love that Gaia exists and that Open Conversations  with Regina Meridith is still going.  Gaia is awesome!"

It's a great Network for spirituality and other information that needs to be passed whether it's food, health or physical fitness even on truth information that's going on in the world. I would highly recommend this site to anyone with an open mind or is willing to open themselves up to information that can be helpful to them. This network has been the best thing for me! George Noory, Regina Meredith, Emery Smith, David Asprey, Freddy Silva, Billy Carson, Susan Geisman and all the channelers the list can go on everyone who has played their part has done a great job in presenting the information and work to help people. I really love this... the work is very positive and informative. I wanted to say Thank you to everybody who's done their part bringing this all together in the way it has become."

Their people  are passionate on providing strongly vetted (really important to me as an amateur researcher) super quality content and a warm friendly experience. Everything about them is 5 stars +!
