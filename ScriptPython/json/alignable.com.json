This is what I consider to be fraud. Just like the person that did the next complaint under this one. I had that very same experience. Why should I have to be the person to take an action to stop Alignable from contacting me? The unmitigated nerve of these people. To put it bluntly, they are terrible! Also like the person that did the review below my review, Alignable made it appear as though someone in my network emailed me and I contacted that person and they confirmed they did not send the email. FRAUD!"

          "Contenu": "Alignable is hard to use and really not worth the effort. I tried it and joined several groups. Most have a no self promotion clause in their rules. If this is to promote your business, you have to self promote. But that is not allowed by every group I joined. There are restrictions on introducing yourself and your business. All of this is really strange for a site that is there to promote a business. I made one post on a women's business site. It was taken down as self promotion even though I saw other posts up for several weeks exactly like it. Maybe it is who you are? If you get an invite. PASS. It is not worth the time.Update: I got a reply from Alignable wanting to talk to me about my experience. I found that reply catering to my experience with their website by saying they are examining their no self-promotion policy What is the use of having a site to promote your business if you are unable to promote your business."

I emailed several times about the charges and to credit my account back the charges. Guess what....no communication. My last email to them this month was letting them know how unprofessional they were by not responding. Instead of returning my funds that I did not authorize, they choose not to respond. Now, I am putting the claim in with my bank and providing my bank with the emails. I will be filing a complaint with BBB as well. You would think instead of making it right...this hideous social media platform chooses to keep a past customers funds and go through all the negativity of bad reviews etc. Oh by the way, before these charges from them, I received an email out the blue from support. My response was to please advise. Well darn without no response....me asking to please advise was not a greenlight to bill my account for services I had not used in 5 months. It amazes me that they were so quick to take funds, yet they lack miserably at customer service and communication."

          "Contenu": "Alignable is marketed as a new social network site for local businesses. I was invited by an employee of a local business to the platform. They had my email in their database from 4 years ago when we reserved something in their store. I don't believe this individual intentionally invited me. I believe while registering they chose the option to allow Alignable access to their email contacts. Alignable's bot found our business url in their database. The Alignable bot is certainly an ingenious bit of spoofing. It drills into your contacts and emails other business owners with the identity of the individual who registered. That person never even knows the emails were sent out in their name. When I registered directly through the site versus the email invite from this individual, I could see how I got the initial email \"invite\".  Once you sign up, it unleashes relentless invites to make you engage with it. I'm seeing invites in our spam folder by businesses unrelated to our market, including out of state businesses.Do not, by any means sign up or allow anyone you know to register with Alignable. Alignable is taking in new unsuspecting victims daily. I highly suggest using the more trusted LinkedIn platform instead, until somebody else offers a safer alternative to Alignable for local businesses."

Without our approval, numerous invitations were sent from our domain to group email addresses, posing as official communications from a user in our company. This not only jeopardizes our reputation but also raises severe concerns about the platform's security and integrity.We reached out to Alignable's executive team as soon as we became aware of this situation, hoping for a swift and adequate response. Regrettably, we received no communication in return, further eroding our trust in their service.At this point, we can't be sure whether Alignable's system was compromised or if this is an inherent issue with their service. Regardless, the potential damage to our reputation and the clear lack of customer support make it impossible for us to recommend Alignable to others.Our Advice: If you're considering using Alignable, proceed with caution. We strongly advise against connecting your company's domain address to their service, as you run the risk of unauthorized and potentially harmful actions being taken on your behalf."

          "Contenu": "Beware!! Alignable will spam your contact list without your permission, despite assurances on their website that they won't. I have been getting an influx of new connection requests in the past week from my contacts (after months of nothing) and discovered just this morning that Alignable emailed 60+ of my contacts with the same generic connection request. The company clearly doesn't care, as evidenced by the ridiculous non-response from Alignable on the many similar comments about the same issue in which they only restate that they won't do what they are obviously doing.*Edit to address Alignable's 4/4/23 reply: I went through the \"onboarding\" process months ago and at that time I did \"skip\" the option to invite others. I am very aware of this option and always decline it (on this and other platforms). The incident I reported was *not* the result of user error during account setup. Again, these connection request messages were sent by Alignable without any choice or initiation on my part. Further, colleagues of mine have been reporting the same thing happening to them in the past few weeks: contact requests are being sent on their behalf with neither their knowledge nor permission. Despite making multiple attempts to raise this concern with Alignable \u2013 that there may be something wrong on their end that needs further investigation \u2013\u00a0the company keeps repeating the assertion that they will never send out connection requests without the user's permission and attempting to deflect these concerns by blaming user error. Interestingly, a search online shows that users have been complaining about this *exact* issue for more than a year, and probably far longer. The fact that the issue still persists clearly demonstrates that Alignable knows about the problem but doesn't care and has no intention of solving the issue. I will continue to warn others about the issues at Alignable and the need for users to protect do everything they can to protect themselves (ideally by avoiding Alignable entirely), since the company clearly won't."

Not saying this is a complete scam, but no real online networking site I've ever seen acts this way. Real web service companies - the legitimate and useful ones like 'Mail Monkey' who ask for your contact list etc. are open about what they do (usually email management and promo activities), and about what they charge for their service. 'Alignable' is pretending to be something it is not.IMO, if anyone really needs this \"service\" to meet people in their area of work, then they are beginners, and will look back one day on this experience as part of their gullible early years.

          "Contenu": "Alignable's concept is clearly defined: become aware of and connect with local businesses.  The execution, however, borders on a train wreck.  For example, there is no place for basic, individual profiles -- e.g. if a citizen simply wants to have a profile, and then connect to local businesses.  The assumption is that everyone is part of a local business, and so you have to list your business name in your profile.  That may seem benign on its face, but consider the ramifications if you work for Amazon, Google, et al.  You'll get spammed to death.  Sure, you can enter hyphens or underscores in your profile's business name, but that's a clunky work-around.Once in the Alignable ecosystem, it is not clear what should happen.  The algorithm driving suggested connections is in dire need of training, but there is no clear path for an individual user to help it out.  There are some preference and interest settings, but they don't seem to impact anything.  To illustrate, I am a middle-aged male who's been getting the same haircut for decades; nowhere in my profile is any interest in hair services or spa services listed; yet at least 30% of the suggestions provided to me by Alignable were for stylists, salons and the like.  Maybe I live in an area with an overabundance of hair service professionals.  Or maybe Alignable is a good idea that is not executed well, at all."

          "Contenu": "A small-business social network focused on solving business problems and helping each other succeed? Sounds great! Too bad the execution is so poor. After half a year I realized I have spent more time helping Alignable fix its issues than building connections to potential colleagues. Alignable actually makes those connections difficult. YMMV if you are based in a densely populated metropolis, but my radius of permitted contacts is way too narrow. Even when a premium member from outside my radius contacted me, I couldn't reply through Alignable unless I paid first. That makes it pretty clear where the company's priorities are. Even premium members complain of limitations on their allowed activities. It's a self-defeating way to run a social network, because your customers will take their relationship off-network (to LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.) when you make it too difficult to work within yours. About that network interface: Alignable is poorly designed and confused about its aims, so as a new user it's hard to find your way and quickly determine what this is for. (Alignable, you haven't communicated anything about yourselves that's as clear and concise as my definition in the first sentence of this review. You should steal it. And try to live up to it.) On the technical side, there are some glitches that are frankly bizarre to see in a 21st-century website. One is the way outgoing messages used to appear (thru spring 2019) with arbitrary line breaks in the middle of words. Are you guys still using Windows 98? Because that's what your message interface reminds me of. Elsewhere you'll find the interface too busy and ambiguous. I haven't forgotten how many steps it took to customize my notifications from Alignable (and trust me, you'll get a lot of them, even when there's nothing new to report). That interface was absurdly unresponsive, forcing you to click twice to expand lists, then select checkboxes one by one. I assume that was intended to make you give up. What it almost did instead was convince me to close my account -- but I can only imagine how difficult they make that process. After half a year and several contacts with Alignable staff, I am persuaded that the company leadership sees customers not as people to be served well, but as sheep to be shorn of vendable data. I don't think the situation is likely to improve.UPDATE: In reply to Nick's comment below, I believe I did enter into the spirit of Alignable's stated mission, and I was thoughtful about which businesses I approached. I don't appreciate the implication that my business was sending out too many invitations or seeking sales opportunities. Also, I cannot buy his claim that the notifications interface was made extra time-consuming \"based on feedback we've had from other members.\" I won't accuse Nick of being dishonest, but I do not believe that that was an honest statement."

And it's important to keep in mind the word \"small.\"--This is not LinkedIn. Real estate agents/brokers, financial advisors, accountants, plumbers, contractors: businesses that are primarily focused on a local area can network beyond where they might otherwise be able to reach. But if networking breakfasts or your local Chamber of Commerce aren't useful to you, Alignable probably won't be, either.It is not a platform for advertising. Nor is it a social network in the mold of Facebook. It IS a platform where business owners can reach out to their local business community for advice, or help, or to share experiences.So if you go into Alignable expecting to boost your sales through social advertising, you will be disappointed. If you want to connect with your peers in an ad-free, conspiracy theory-free environment, like a non-stop online MeetUp, it will work for you.I'm not on Alignable to generate business, mostly because I don't have clients/customers in my local area (and in most cases they aren't small businesses). But I enjoy being able to help a national community in my profession that I probably wouldn't reach otherwise, and it's good to be in touch with peers outside of my normal circle."

Some of them not even have a Website so we can get to know the business and their quality.I am now starting to do a second contact to business in my network to see if I can get to know them better and start referring them. I usually search for highly recommended business and most of them related to my own.Unfortunately most of them don't return message after we do the first contact. Eider they are not interested or their are too busy or just don't see the value to have a good solid network.A lot of business don't know how to implement Alignable into the business and maybe they need some in-depth explanation or tutorials in how to use and incorporate Alignable and how to develop a solid network of contacts and referrals.No use to have a good tool like Alignable if only a few business are returning the first contact message. I always try to make contact and get into a phone conversation so I can get a better feel of the business that I want to referrer and vise versa.Maybe Alignable should promote and emphasize first and second communications between business.I think all business should promote more communication between themselves and get to know each-other better.Thank you."

An astounding 95% of the business I received in my 1st year in business came directly from Alignable. This was vital for my family's survival to navigate the pandemic. I wasn't even using the paid membership! I utilized the Alignable referral platform in the best ways I knew how as a long-term marketing person. All the functionality within the Alignable platform helped me to connect with people on a much deeper level. In a 10-month period recently, I received 17 straight 5-Star Google Reviews from my Alignable clients. It simply made sense to continue to grow my network by becoming a premium member which opened up even more functionality to me. Adding Smart Connects recently has also been extremely helpful too. My bandwidth is completely stretched and my dance card is full and I love it. Frankly, Alignable coupled with my marketing talents has made my business soar! Thank you Alignable!"

With the current \"atmosphere\" for SMB's here in Alberta and all over the world, it has definitely been more challenging to acquire new clientele and everyone is looking for the best \"price\"! When I hear companies offering \"free\" delivery it really gets my haunches up as so many companies have been \"squeezing\" the delivery & transportation industry to provide \"Amazon\" like rates. I think that soon there will be a monumental shift in the way business is done & Alignable is definitely a part of that shift!"
