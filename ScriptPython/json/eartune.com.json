Regardless the size I chose, regardless how well I try to seat them in my ears, the result is a very poor seal and therefore a very poor ANC performance. At least, know I know that the original ear tips are actually very good. I\u2019m sorry to say, but the Fidelity tips are absolute cheap crap."

Plus the sound quality was severely diminished when they did work. I would not recommend this product if you have the Bose quite comfort model."

Missed the time frame for it to be the gift I was hoping to give. Now They've switched buds because the ones she had didn't fit so theyre useless... Other than that, Its my understanding they fit at least, and they eventually came in so theres that too."

          "Contenu": "I can confirm they work, but do take a few tries to figure out how they fit in your ear. The reason for 3 stars vs more was my overall experience. Before purchasing, I reached out to Eartune asking for the time I can expect the product to ship and was quoted 3-4 weeks. With this in mind I waited until 4 weeks to check in as I had not received any updates. At this time, they responded letting me know my ear molds were smaller than normal and asked if I still wanted to proceed and I let them know yes. I also shared I would be traveling in 2 weeks and was hoping to have them by the date I would be leaving. After a week I still had no updates on shipping and reached out again. They got back to me 2 days later which was the Friday before my trip (leaving Monday) saying they had shipped that day. As expected this was not ready by Monday and I didn\u2019t receive it until Thursday. I had to have someone pick it up for me as I was out of town and overall just frustrated with the lack of communication. If you are interested in purchasing the product, it does work but expect delays in shipping."

At this point, I\u2019ll keep using the Eartunes, for the sake of not spending more money on an already expensive product like the Air Pods Pro."

Overall a great experience, would definitely buy again in the future."

I got the medium and it's better than the silicone, but I think I needed the large for a better fit."

Two suggestions:Clearly label the AirPods / AirPods Pro versions on your website (like say \u201cworks with AirPods 3rd generation\u201d) for custom tips. I imagine you may be losing sales since it isn\u2019t clear and I hesitated for the regular AirPods. This will happen when they release new Pros soon too so I\u2019d keep up with that. Provide a few more updates proactively since it is a long process. Getting updates a few times would let me know nothing got lost or off track."

Eartunes has since made it right even though it was probably my fault that it was wrong in the first place.  The product itself is nice.  The foam is more comfortable than silicon pieces originally on the AirPods.  The only thing I don't like is that the foam does not block sound as well as the silicon.  This may be because I should have ordered the extra large instead of the large.  Update: Thanks to amazing support from Eartunes, I was able to get the extra large.  The extra large work better in terms of comfort and staying in place but not as good at blocking noise as the stock silicon.  The extra large is still better than the large at blocking noise for me."

Memory foam is also quite comfortable and puts very little pressure on my ears. However claims that it can improve noise isolation are not entirely accurate unless you were unable to get a good seal before. If anything noise isolation has very slightly decreased. For me that wasn\u2019t a deal breaker because the ANC still works about 98-99% as well as it did with the silicone tips and they actually stay in my ears! TLDR; If you just have the problem, like me, of your earbuds constantly falling out even with a good seal it will only fix that issue. Please also make a sample pack that comes with SML instead of just three packs of sss mmm lll."

Also, the carrying case is really bulky, and huge compared to the size of the hearing protectors, I would appreciate a keychain type case to make sure that it goes with me easily. I'm not sure if the included ear lube needs to be used every time, if so, a container that closes instead of a ketchup pouch that leaks inside the case would be a big improvement."

One of mine is still difficult every time, but I assume that's because of my ear.It did take the 5 weeks that they say it may take and I had gotten anxious.  I also thought I was going to get a different type of case that held tips and buds.  It wasn't what I had seen on the web site/maybe a video.Customer Service responded right away when I wrote a couple of times to make sure I had done my order correctly.  A confirmation of receipt of the order/impressions would have been nice.Overall a good experience.  I'm very happy with my purchase of custom fit tips for Airpod Pros."

I can't say enough good things about them.I also bought the case to store the earbuds with the wireless headphones. I like the case, but the earbuds don't stay in the lid compartment where they are meant to. I'd add a second strip of elastic fabric across the top half of the lid (not just the bottom half), so they stay in place, but it's not a big design problem. I just find them on top of the charging case when I unzip and open the carrying case on occasion."

With that in mind,  my only hesitation with your custom mold's design was the need to remove them every time before I could put the airpods pro back into the case. Fortunately I've arrived at a simple solution. I have some earbud tips that fit nicely onto your white baffles -- the baffles being the white hard plastic deals that snap onto the airpods pro- which I now keep on the baffles most of the time, and THEY fit in the charging case. So for regular use I have your white baffles installed plus eartips similar to Apple's in size and performance. Then, on those occasions I need better isolation, I pop off those tips and use your custom earmolds. Very happy with this solution. Eartune might even consider shipping a few sizes of similar earbud tips as maybe an option, perhaps including a small surcharge, with your custom mold orders."

          "Contenu": "The team at eartune went above and beyond to make sure I was going to be happy with the eartune fidelity tips for my AirPod pros. The problem was that I have extremely tiny ear canals. The eartune team initially told me that my AirPod pros would protrude so much it would look funny and asked if I would like a refund. I refused the refund and told them I didn\u2019t care if they stuck out too much as I just wanted my AirPod pros to stay in my ears. So a few days later they informed me that they had modified the original design in order to accommodate my tiny ears as well as not look ridiculous. I love them. My AirPods stay in and they are comfortable. They fit so well I\u2019m able to ride my scooter with them in! Thanks eartune!"

I am able to get the good seal indicator with there original medium size tips, but not the foam.  I am not sure if this is an apple thing or just my goofy ear canals??
