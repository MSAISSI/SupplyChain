Over this time, the company has developed other/new products but is still somehow working on the Magfast Life/Wall. They are shipping things out in batches but I don't see where I can find out what batch I'm assigned to or when I should expect my assigned batch to ship. I can understand that this company was crowdfunded however 3 years is quite a long time even for this."

Being in a startup myself, I think I have been reasonable with expectations.  I have watched MAGFAST move on to other products and see all the great reviews.  The burn was when they stopped responding and I still don't have my order.  I won't use them.  In fairness, MAGFAST did respond to this posting and did refund my \"pre-order\" 18 months later. I just don't like being the customer that fell through the cracks and was ignored."

I invested nearly $500 almost 2.5 years ago and still haven't received the product. Despite my initial excitement, the extended wait time has left me disappointed.The lack of updates regarding the order's status has been frustrating. I understand that delays can occur, but 2.5 years is unacceptable and the absence of communication has made me feel neglected as a customer.Magfast continues to supposedly develop and promote new products that they want people to buy, yet they still haven't fulfilled past outdated orders. This makes no sense to me. Continuing to collect people's money and deliver no products!I urge Magfast to address this issue promptly and provide clarity on when I can expect my order. Transparency and improved communication and actual products would greatly improve my satisfaction as a customer.In summary, my experience with Magfast has been unsatisfactory due to the lengthy wait time, lack of products, and lack of updates. Until this issue is resolved, I cannot recommend the company or products to others since I have yet to receive any products.

I already paid for my items  As it turned out, the website helpfully ore-selected further items I might like to purchase for $1375. After contacting the company they sent a video showing how I could unselect the pre-selected items. Unfortunately, the website was slightly different that the one in the video and I ended up getting charged $165 for 7 or 8 of the same charging cable in different colors and a small charging block. Helpful because what animal wants to use a white charging cord when they\u2019re wearing blue jeans?  I had to call my credit card company to dispute the charge. There\u2019s probably plenty of time as I suspect I have to verify my address for this purchase in another 3-4 years. This company is a scam and they will steal all your money if they could."

Also, ever notice that every November they're asking for more investment?  Yet, they don't sell to retail, do not distribute overseas, do not attend the major trade shows around the world and only sell direct to consumer.  All the while inflating their value with falsehoods.  Bet anything next month they will be asking for more investment at a higher BS evaluation.  All a scam to pay their bills.

If you can't fill orders, stop trying to create new products. It started with Air & Light... Now there is a suitcase? When I preordered back in July 2020, I expected a year following the pandemic. However, Magfast keeps producing these lame investor webinars and introduces new products... duck you, stop using our investments, and fulfill our dam orders already.  You see Magfast you're going to tickoff the wrong person and that person will file a class action lawsuit, against what is still a startup company since they're still begging for investments.... if the other 1-star reviews are true...if I get my order within this decade, I'm probably going to be disappointed. So, if you're looking to invest in the company, you probably should do some serious ducking research yourself. If a class action lawsuit showed up at my door... as of right NOW... yeah I'd sign it.

It's listed as \"Currently in Final Development.\"It's amazing that they have time to release weekly videos touting their \"Next Big Thing\" instead of actually building their products - this time it's luggage of all things. Previous products include a USB cable as if THEIR USB cable was somehow better than any of the thousands of others on the market. It's SEPTEMBER 2023 and even the iPhone has moved past the Lighting connector to USB-C. I'm embarrassed that I recommended the Magfast to my friends when it was first announced and some of them bought it and all are still waiting!Total rip-off. The only reason I haven't asked for a refund is I wanted to see if they would actually deliver a product before they end up in jail. (One Trust Pilot complaint - that your reviews are only valid for things that have happened in the last 12 months. MagFast has been stringing me along since June 2020 so I  had to enter a date from a year ago to get this to register. I'm stating this as I see my review as true and the date issue as a failure on the part of Trust Pilot and not a false statement on my part since I've included it in my review."

They have taken investor money/time/effort and put it toward other, higher profit margin investments while leaving most early investors with nothing but empty promises. Just check out their own website status page at Magfast  /status/ (I am not allowed to put links but easy to find). It has not been updated in 2 months because they are not producing what they promised. Do you want to bet that even the \"Shipping Now\" people have not received the items they have been waiting and waiting for? Consumers have an advocate in their government...  ReportFraud.ftc.gov."

They live in some alternate reality where taking four years to ship a product is normal and customers complaining is an insult to them. Also, they are now claiming how many thousands of satisfied customers they have.  That is for their USB C cable, not for the MagFast system, they have barely shipped.  Anyone can ship a decent cable; there are thousands out there.  But the original product is the ultimate vapourware Original review:Seymour and his minions are arrogant and condescending to their customers.  Do not preorder. You will wait for years while they invest your money and make the profit. There are dozens of better MagSafe chargers on the market since I originally ordered. And now I have all of them and they work great.  I don\u2019t want or need their obsolete chargers any longer.  Qi 2 is coming and it will have MagSafe built in while Seymour is still trying to get the 4 year old technology out the door."

Charged extreme until all LEDs were lit, same flashing red lights when I use it and will not charge a phone past 89%. 2) Life - will not stay on more than 30 minutes when charging. Tried to use it to finish charging a phone (the last 11% from extreme) and will only get to 90% and will stop and turn off. This even happens when it is plugged in. And it gets very hot. 3) Air - again will not fully charge a phone when used attached to either extreme or life. However, if I plug it in with any USB C cable, it will charge a phone to 100%. It seems to perform no better than any other product of this type."

          "Contenu": "I wasn\u2019t going to review since my experience is so bad imo but they keep asking so here goes. I was a pretty early adopter, as I\u2019m almost 5 years ago. At that time we were told that if we bought a certain bundle, we would get one of the products free. Great deal I thought! At the time I was living with a couple roommates so I just made the purchase for them as well. 4 years later when they finally acknowledge me, the new info is that it is only one free product per person, no per order. Okay, that\u2019s fine, not going to worry about it. Three main issue is that it took so long for me to get my products when others were getting after 2 years, 18 months etc. And even that would have been okay if my requests for information had been more than a canned response. So much time has passed since their initial roll-out and now, that others have caught up. I did receive my products and my opinion on them is \u2018okay\u2019. The Life won\u2019t keep a change over more than 18hrs. It\u2019s nothung more than a brick really and you can\u2019t plug it into a wall directly. Which I think they originally showed. Anyway, not happy with the service, the support, nor the products. And one more thing, I\u2019ve revive exactly 1 of 3 orders so we\u2019ll see how much longer the other 2 take to get here. Won\u2019t recommend and there are far superior charging options out there imo."

I understand covid and all that stuff but its not an excuse. This isnt a startup company, they were already around and claimed to have made and shipped items by the time i backed or i wouldnt of backed it at all. They love to put out email after email about \"new exclusive products\" but its a joke, they dont deliver on anything and have been telling angry buyers on social media for years they are shipping things but wheres the proof? Is this really a scam? Very poor business management? All i know is after waiting 3 years for my items to arrive, i dont think they ever will. They dont seem to bother with replying to help request or inquiry emails either.."

After watching till you get the promo code which was for a free cable after paying shipping/ handling the order page also never states that its limited to 1 per person / household I understand giving something away for \"free\" might be limited but there was no evidence that I could see to show that so I went ahead and placed my order anyways if I would of saw / heard anything stating otherwise I wouldn't of wasted my time which should be evident . Again this review isn't against the product which is of good quality, it's just against the \"customer service\" or lack there of i also want to state that I received no correspondence to my issue directly from the company but they had no issue responding to my review."

          "Contenu": "As a former customer of MagFast, who waited years for a product and if I had not cancelled, would likely still not have it, I can say that, contrary to what their Customer Service will tell you, MagFast is already obsolete if you have a modern iPhone.  Apple introduced MagSafe magnetic charging devices a few years ago and soon Qi2 will be available for all modern phones.  MagSafe charges iPhones at twice the speed of standard Qi chargers, of which the MagFast product is an example.  Apple MagSafe also magnetically attaches to your phone so no need to worry about placement. I had wanted to order their watch charger they promised 3 years ago which is still awaiting production.  But you can get a similar products now from other companies and that is what I have done.Companies like ESR, Mophie are shipping products today that are compatible with modern phones and MagFast is still working on getting obsolete technology to their initial customers.  Do not believe them when they say their products are not obsolete.  Because a little research will show you otherwise.  Just go to esrgear.com or zagg.com on and you\u2019ll find products that you can use today.  Mophie has a standup MagSafe battery pack that is just awesome.  Sure MagFast makes a nice cable, but honestly, so do a dozen other companies.  I\u2019m sure their luggage is nice but why have a suitcase with a giant battery attached that you have to take off before checking it in for a flight?  Does MagFast know batteries can\u2019t be in,(or on), checked luggage?  And then you have to carry the giant battery on the plane with you?  I know they\u2019re trying and I respect that, but unless they can produce MagSafe chargers an ship them in a timely manner, I can no longer consider myself a customer.  My original order was placed on November 27, 2019."

Did anyone ever get the chargers from MAGFAST. I\u2019m batch 12 and more and more delays. Yet Seymour has decided to ship Lux cables (not even thought of when we ordered the MAGFAST chargers.) and start a project of suitcases??? Many of the reviews on here are about the Lux cables, not chargers, MAGFAST presentations (they are done well and promise quality) and product promises with no real chargers in Hand.  Often explaining why yet  another delay is necessary. I have several Lux cables and they do have a nice feel and are rightfully rated highly on here\u2026.but they are not the chargers! Magfast is now taking orders for suitcases while many wait and wait and wait for the delivery of even one charger\u2026 instead excuses after excuses. I\u2019m now seeing other companies selling in stores similar products that were promised to us by MAGFAST including a phone charger that jump starts cars! Seems they can get their products out while MAGFAST is still working on trying to get charging products made. The Covid related excuses don\u2019t fly anymore!! Store shelves are full again. Cars are being manufactured at almost precovid speed. Computers are available again despite the pandemic and reports of chip shortages. So I\u2019m asking did anybody receive even part of their chargers order?Many reviewers talk about the great customer service but now the status page is asking not to call and ask about their order. Apparently customer service people must be on an assembly line because too many customers are calling and slowing down production. At least that is a new excuse. Yes they offer a refund if you want it but I want what they promised 5 years ago!  I guess I\u2019m a fool because I even invested in the company hoping the promises of quality and advanced products were real and timely. I\u2019m afraid other companies will saturate the market before Magfast gets out the gate."

Magfast keeps creating new products like the new Luxe cable and have shipped these.  But they cannot seem to find the time to finish a wall socket plug, a charger for an Apple Watch or the cigarette charger for your car. Most of these outstanding items will be obsolete when they ship.  No one uses a cigarette lighter plug in their cars and Apple has released 4-5 new versions of their Apple Watch since Magfast have pitched these specific products. Still waiting on my Air charger ordered when Apple 5 watch came out.  Magfast will probably offer updated products if and when they come out with a special offer (meaning for an extra up-charge to early pre-orders).  China has come out with similar copies of the products Magfast introduced years before.  No Magfast, I do not want a refund, just the products ordered three years ago. And their response will not address the lack of fulfilling outstanding items."

          "Contenu": "I placed a \"pre-order\" in April for $500 worth of products.  I attended a seminar to get a \"free - just pay shipping\" power cord.  We only have Apple products, was told that the free cord was available in Apple and Universal C versions. It took several months and a new purchase to get a cord I could use. I have contacted the company several times, and keep hearing the same thing - they are under development of these products - But since then they have released numerous additional products and can not identify WHEN the products I ordered will be shipped.  (But they also sent 2 people on a 30 day trip to promote the newest products, while still not delivering on the products ordered in April.)  In August I was told (via email only) my order was delayed because I had ordered the items in the color green.  So I changed my order to white to have it delivered sooner - that changed my \"batch\" to batch 31, which was now targeted to ship by 10/31 but is again - delayed with no explanation why or a revised target ship date.  Newer, more expensive products are being sold and were promised to ship before Christmas, but not the original items.  This is not a good business practice.  The cable I have is fabulous, so I do still want the rest of the charging units that I purchased - but I am frustrated at their putting higher priced items above the earlier orders, and telling me that I was pre-funding the development work so I am not entitled to communication about the status of my order?  I have to dig back into old emails to find the link to find my order/sequence #.  Just ship the items ordered please!  I one of the emails I was told that there are people ahead of me waiting for their products still and they ordered inn 2017!  5 years is insane to wait for something that you paid for in advance.  It says that I'm in batch 31, but there are no batches listed AFTER 31, so are all orders since April, 2023 in batch 31?  It shows shipping is \"delayed\" for batches 25-31, which were planned to have started shipping in May of this year.MAGFAST receipt W230808-752441"

High cost, low quality i am finding with my initial use of the first 3 products I received, doesn't charge very nicely, slow charging, low battery life, and noticeable battery drain when not in use.. have to remove my case to wirelessly charge using air with my past wireless chargers and to easily charge through my case.you have to remove your phone from the case to charge on MagFast Air, charging it on its side with the case still on you spend so much time to find the charging sweet spot only to here your phone ding 20 minutes later because it lost its charging spot, and standing it up to charge without the case covers up the speaker on the phone so any notifications or calls are extremely muffled.. the MagFast Life maybe get 1 1/2 cell phone charges before it's dead (I fully charged my phone and had 30% life left on it), my mophie power bank from 5+ years ago has a better charge life even after having it this long (can charge just over 2 phones) , and doesn't lose as much % when not even being used as Life or Extreme looses just sitting there... As for Extreme I haven't had to jump start any cars yet, but can say having it plugged into a tablet that is being used as a register for 8 hours straight uses up about 70% of Extremes battery life, so I will say extreme can last a long time will being used, but i also noticed after fully charging extreme it looses about 10% battery life every 2-3 weeks of not being used .. for comparisons, my mophie power bank lost about 10-20% battery life on standby in about 8 months of sitting idle in a backpack..So my overall review at this time, is the product falls extremely short for what is was supposed to be.. high end costs, middle end quality..."

I purchased the EXTREME package of products a few years ago and even invested in the company, but the product doesn't live up to the hype.

Took it on vacation in England thinking it would be great as a replacement for our other portable chargers and instead after a week of using it, we went back to our old chargers.  It charges extremely SLOW, the device connector didn't work and just unreliable to be honest.  We also took AIR with us.  It works, but again, very, very slow.  If you're looking for any kind of speed in charging, these products are not for you.  Very disappointed.  The good 'ole Apple plugs are still the best unfortunately in the case of AIR.  Where AIR may be of use is at home by your computer while you're working since it can hold your phone up and charge while you work.  But other than that, these products are not fast, don't work well and unfortunately do not compare with existing products in the marketplace.  Maybe the cables are great, but don't have any.  LIFE and AIR basically suck for the money and use."

I have not tested the jumpers.Similary, the LIFEless unit charges my phone only once, and only by cable. The Qi does not work. Though it is light to carry, the angle of the cable is not convenient for charging while in a pocket. The device has been returned to its box with no expectation of use."

After an hour or more of listening to this nice gentleman's sales pitch, he he began offering a $500 Pro Kit bundle...with a cuple \"free\" products. When I asked about the free product for watching, I got this in reply:\"Kate @ 9:20 AMHello Melissa! Yes, you\u2019ve been entered into the $1,000 Tech monthly giveaway. We will announce this months winner later this month.\" BTW: I didn't know or ask about a monthly giveaway.Here was my question to them:1:22 PM\"How do we get the free sample we were told we would get for watching? OR, do we only get the \u201cfree\u201d additional Extreme if we buy the bundle?? If that last option is true, I feel as though its a slick sales tactic & not TRULY free. If we have to buy something in order to get the \u201cfree\u201d sample product, then its not free for having watched the presentation, is it? That makes it an extra device IF u purchase this $500 bundle. I was wondering how a startup culd afford to give that many samples away\u2026now i know how, you don\u2019t. Just an FYI: people are generally not that easily duped & that is certainly not the way to build trust or positive word of mouth about your new company. Please correct me if Im wrong. Shame. I was excited to try it out & even invest, if possible.\"I rated this product a 2 star. If I find I'm incorrect, I will gladly adjust that accordingly. Awaiting the response."

I get plenty of emails about all the great things Magfast is doing and to join to watch this and that. It was great initially but now it\u2019s just plain insulting that they continue to promote products when many of the items ordered 2 years ago haven\u2019t been delivered on. This is just my opinion and I\u2019m sure someone will reach out and tell me this is a start up company etc etc. MagFast does seem to have a great vision and it is nice that they keep these updates etc going but it sure would be nice to have a timeline of when these products will be completed vs 2 years in and TBA.

I have emailed Magfast and received a email back within a few hours stating that it is unknown when the batch that my purchases are on will ship, but to please wait patiently.

          "Contenu": "On March 20, 2019 I got suckered into watching the MagFast video online so I could get a free wall charger. Of course, the crazy low prices they were offering for adding more products to the order were too good to pass up. I ended up paying over $60 for additional products. Unfortunately, I did my research after the fact. I didn\u2019t realize they had been working on this project already for several years. After about 6 months of receiving email updates each week, i realized this product is never going to come to market. They are so many years into the project and they change the logo, change the design, discover a flaw with this or that ... there is no way that they would even have money to start production at this point. The money from preorders is probably long gone. I don\u2019t know if this is a scam, or if this guy just is terrible at running a business. Either way - don\u2019t let the discounted presale lure you in. Wait until it comes to market. I really don\u2019t think that day will come. It\u2019s no closer now than it was 15 months ago."

          "Contenu": "Magfast has a great story and I loved the presentation, innovation, and the pro kit concept.  I placed my pre-order two years ago and after a year of waiting kind of shrugged and expected to wait a couple of more months since Covid was over.  Finally a batch number was assigned to me and I got excited again.  Then came a stock offering with Magfast not delivering a single product.  Next they split up the pre-orders promising a Hello kit.  This kit excluded the Road and Wall units.  The Wall units were the enticements to pre-order the pro kits.  Next came another delay in shipment followed by a second stock offering.  Again no products delivered to date.  Now a third change to the delivery schedule.  I am looking at almost two and one-half years now with no real expectation that Magfast will hold true to that.  Technology is usually outdated when waiting this long for your pre-ordered products.  The last batch shown is October 2023 for delivery.  When will the remaining components of the pro kit be sent?  Who knows?  I know that wall unit plugs included in the pro kit we expected first will probably not be shipped until 2024 or 2025.With Magfast now developing a new cable that they want folks to pre-order.  Will this take 3 years to deliver on?  Not sure I will order until my first of two shipments arrive.  It\u2019s hard to watch their long video updates when Magfast has not delivered anything but investor kits."

Minus 3 stars for: a) breathlessly optimistic but unfulfilled promises about how amazing technology takes time, it's crowd-funding, etc. Today is actually the 17-month - to the day - since my pre-order. That's longer than any other crowd-funded thing I've ever paid for by about 50%. I'm hoping the expression \"Good things come to those who wait\", but perhaps Seymour can forgive me for having trouble believing it applies to MAGFAST products at this point.b) many words about how supply chain problems are delaying delivery etc. Yes, that's understood but the most recent response from customer service in August 2021 was \"It will take some months to ship all the pre-orders\". Indeed. 5 so far. So how much is \"some\" at this point, in the hindsight of January 2022?c) endless invitations to invest. You have to admire the audaciousness of a company that continues to explain why they're having significant difficulties delivering products to continue to ask you to invest in them.Finally, who are all the 4,000+ people on here positively reviewing the product? When did they receive their orders? What's the SECRET to getting your order fulfilled? Please do tell."

The problem is I here how great things are as a sales pitch but once you have them in hand it's a different story. As for your commercial it was a good one and it answered all question to make me interested in doing a video review on the Magfast. I only give 5 star reviews once tested. One thing I'm already disappointed about is the cost for the for the tips I personal think they should be included with the base unit. This is a edit after I ordered the base unit Pretty much the base unit is just a block with USB plugs in it and has no more value than the 3 pack of outlets with 6 plugs and 4 usb ports that I bought for about the same price and have been using for about 5 years now. You want to bring value to this product you are going to have to include the charging tips for the same price. and at $42.00 just for the tips is not a good price as I can buy a usb C cable for 5 dollars and it will last me a year or more. You want to make it affordable realize that $42.00 s almost $60.00 Canadian it would be very hard to market charging tips on top of a $60.00 base unit here in Canada at a $120.00 just to get started using Magfast is hard to swallow in these hard times."

I think they started out with a goal that was not as obtainable as they though. I love the idea, the upgrades they talk about they are great. but there is still no product. i give two stars because if this ever come to life and becomes real, this would be fantastic. but for now, 2 years trying to be very patent and just waiting, seams like nothing will ever come out of this.  I gave them $175.00 and now some of that is not even required due to the shift in technology and the updates they have given.  example, i have the family cable pack, well i don't need that any more for two reasons. one, i don't have anything i would use this on that is not type C which they have made standard. and they include tips anyways now. so that is $25,  I would love to have the extreme that i paid for some day, but i have already bought another product while waiting on this to come true.  i could not wait anymore and needed one at work to keep my laptop running all day. although the one i bought can not jump start a car, which would be nice when i let my work truck die because i leave on a light.... my ramble summed up, 2 years, and still just a very nice, but imaginary idea that i would love for it to come to real life sooner rather then later."

I have a degree in applied math, was a computer programmer for the first 5 or 6 years out college, and my current business/hobby is all high end technology and everything after the first 5 years was sales - and marketing.That said, I was totally lost watching the video.  One of the first things I learned in sales is that one should sell \"benefits/solutions\", and not \"products/features\".  What I heard was something to the equivalent of \"you can easily connect this 'box' to that 'box', and this 'box' has 3 USB connections, and this 'box' has these two kinds of connectors and blah, blah, blah\" but never anything like \"Here are some real world examples of how you can use these pieces of advanced technology can be integrated to make charging easier, more consistent, faster and with fewer wires\"  And then give some examples.  Your presentation may have gotten there eventually, but I quit watching after 30 minutes as I had no clue how any of your 'boxes' would help address MY specific situations.  We have 3 iPads in different rooms in the house; 3 MacBooks, 2 iPhones and two Apple watches, and two AppleTVs. And when we travel, we have to carry along 2 phone chargers, 2 watch chargers and 2 computer chargers. Surely, out of all of those 'boxes' you could have given some examples so that I could have figured out that I need 'Box 1' Box 3' and 'Box 4\" connected in 'this' way.  But I have no idea.  NONE.I have seen lots of ads for a combo watch/phone/ear bud chargers.  Those are simple to understand.  But I was hoping your products would take that concept to the next step.  But instead I wasted 30 minutes of my life since I gained no useful knowledge such that I could make an informed decision.I"

Their marketing is (update: was) compelling, their R&D is (update: sounded) intriguing, but their operational ability is still unproven. If they cannot deliver from the funds they have received already, they don't deserve the responsibility of more funds from others. (I'm happy to update this when I receive the product)(Update: I'm pretty shocked that a company would care so little about updating paying customers on actually deliver status. I will certainly never trust \"crowdfunded\" product development again, and, even if they happen to deliver a stellar product, will never purchase Magfast again. They have lost my trust!Lingering question: how many chargers have the early investors had to purchase while they wait for the \"charger to end all chargers?\" I'd guess it counterbalances all the trees Magfast supposedly planted.I remind you of two of Confucius's great sayings: \"The charger you have works better than the one you don't have!\" and \"the charger that exists is superior to the one that doesn't exist.)"

          "Contenu": "I clicked on the link after watching the short promo video that came up on my Facebook. I registered because you seemed home grown and genuine. And because I believe that a good charger can make a huge difference to quality of life.  I think I believe in your ideals.  I also was excited when you said \u201cjust by registering we\u2019ll send you this amazing charger\u201d. I listened to at least an hour of the presentation. I will not be buying any of your products, despite the passion you obviously have for it and the work you\u2019ve put in. Here are the issues: Function:I charge my devices at night.  Only at night. The batteries these days are good enough that they last the day.  I would t buy a product that I had to charge through the day.   I don\u2019t need power banks.I don\u2019t need kitchen chargers. I don\u2019t even need office chargers.  My devices last as long as they need to. So the charger I need has to sit on an easily reachable side table in my bedroom. Ideally easily visible to me.  Ideally charging my Apple Watch at the same time.  Ideally Qi. Ideally super fast. Ideally beautiful. Your Air will do that for the phone. But I\u2019m not mounting it on the Wall. And I\u2019m not charging a Life every day to plug into the back of it.  So it needs a charging cable.  And I have a competitors version that is a quarter the cost and more value.  And yours doesn\u2019t charge the watch.  Your Time is cute. But over engineered. I think you\u2019ve mostly over engineered actually, unfortunately. Solving problems that arent real problems\u2026 just engineering problems.  The extreme is the pinnacle of this: I don\u2019t need a car booster.  In this day and age:.  Who buys a 1300$ iPhone, hundreds of dollars of charging equipment, but has a car from the 80s that doesn\u2019t automatically  turn off headlights? Boosting car engines is not in this demographic. Design: I\u2019m sorry.  The blocks are ugly.  They just are.  They\u2019re too big. Huge really. They add to visual clutter, and while the lack of cords is nice, the bulk of them on surfaces and mounted on the wall is unappealing. The extreme is a brick. It\u2019s funny that you used it as a image of all the other chargers\u2026 I have zero interest of having that in my house. Some elements of the design are really nice.  The small cords, for example, with the magnets in the tips.  The idea of the air folding up is nice. Click bait: Don\u2019t promise a free charger and then click bait for a multi hour presentation without following through.  Bad business.  Free is free.  Free is not : spend 350 and we\u2019ll throw this thing in for \u201cfree\u201d."

Every day, I\u2019m amazed at the various presentations - each more technologically mind boggling than its predecessor\u2019s. But this kind of high tech marketing has taken on a feeling of fantasy rather than of reality. Not unlike a pleasant dream that feels so real upon awakening but fades as the morning progresses. I signed up for the lengthy video presentation and watched it recently and I was left with that feeling of surrealism. I have not pre-ordered and it\u2019s not my intention to dissuade anyone from doing so. I\u2019m merely giving my opinion of what I got out of the video presentation. Some of what I derived gives me concern but I have no intention of making accusations of the legitimacy of the product or of the company\u2019s principals. But the fact that there is still no product after so much time, is a red flag for me. I have read the company replies to the negative reviews and parts of them appear copied and pasted, ie: \u201ccrowdfunding a large project has bumps in the road; \u201cquality products take time\u201d; \u201cwe\u2019re an honest company\u201d, et al, I imagine to save time. They give very well-crafted replies to complaints but no real answers or solutions. That\u2019s another concern. Despite the company\u2019s explanation, the video presentation was excessively long in my opinion. I wasn\u2019t watching to get a free gift. I was intrigued about the product. Using the owner\u2019s daughter as a cute lure is effective but it felt a bit manipulative to me. But then, I\u2019ve never cared for that kind of approach.Bottom line for me is this: Innovative products have been manufactured for generations long before \u201ccrowd funding\u201d existed. In fact, all of these investment generators like \u201ccrowd funding\u201d and \u201cGo Fund Me\u201d are rife with scammers, snake oil salesmen, and thieves, in addition to legitimate entrepreneurs and inventors. Product development somehow existed just fine before these fund raising platforms were around and my own experience with them has been largely negative. I can certainly see the benefit to a small business but the \u201cinvestor\u201d must be careful. Is Magfast a risky investment? I don\u2019t know, but I have concerns. If Magfast was available right now, I would probably buy one. I might even \u201cpre-order\u201d if there were final products being prepped for delivery at this time. But with only a vague, nebulous timeline, I will make do with the battery chargers that are already on the market. Let\u2019s be honest: there are countless battery packs and chargers available right now - including the car jumping feature (I have one that even has a solar power option!) I\u2019m sorry but the Magfast is not a new invention. Granted, it\u2019s got some mighty nifty innovations and conveniences that I like, but it\u2019s still a battery and charger. And the added bells and whistles, while nice, are not so mind blowing (for me), that I\u2019m willing to \u201cinvest\u201d several hundred dollars in advance to \u201chopefully\u201d get one at some undetermined futuristic date. But yes, if it was available today, I would probably buy one. I like the concept. With respect, there are simply too many unknowns here for a product that already exists. And no amount of polished marketing, nor enthusiastic pitches by the inventor (and his teenage daughter), will convince me otherwise. I wave the flag of entrepreneurialism but this flag looks a bit too red at the moment anyway, for my comfort level. I hope I\u2019m wrong.Thank you.Post hoc: I received a personal reply from the company shortly after I published my review. I appreciated the honesty and transparency in his words. I have slightly edited my review to insure my tone was not accusatory of or even implying dishonesty. I don\u2019t know the man and some of the one star reviews I have read, frankly, were below the belt. That\u2019s uncalled for. He offered no new information (and said as much) but nor did he offer excuses or attach blame to his vendors. He gave me a stand-up reply which I value. Honesty is always the best policy. In business and in life. I gave an additional star in my review as a result. It appears that this company is doing their best to get Magfast manufactured and into consumer\u2019s hands. But it could be awhile. If folks don\u2019t mind waiting, it looks like it will be a quality product."

Needless to say I am was disappointed when I sampled it before wrapping for Christmas gifts, but I'll keep the product.  We're always searching for cords."

I really was hoping that these chargers were going to be a crowd pleaser and a wow factor when I showed people what I had.

They fish for good reviews. All of their other products look well overpriced and underperforming."

Sure they untangle pretty easy, but everyone of them has kinks in the cable from being wrapped to tight on the spools! oh my!Last two complaints... the cardboard on the spools and blister packs (C/A adapters) is very difficult to open. It should be easy peel glue or light pressure burst outs. Nope it takes a really sharp \ud83d\udd2a to do it easily. easy to injure and easy to damage brand new expensive stuff.And... the DNA/fingerprint whatever could be easier. The only clear instructions is 'go to a URL to register'. That's innovative (like every other product in the world!) and it is the last thing on the page! Big suggestion: (one big QR code - click here\u27a1\ufe0f, followed by an online portal that says snap a photo of your serial number... duh!Oh, and I don't want instructions on how to write a review!"

However, I'm still at a loss as to where my initial pre-order from 1/31/2019 fits into the \"batch\" cycle.  I know I have been assigned a batch, but to this point customer service has not been able to tell me how I was placed in that batch.  When asked about how many pre-orders occured prior to mine, which have yet to be fulfilled, customer service cannot tell me.I still believe in the Magfast products and can't wait to finally get my order 4+ years later, I just wish there was a little more transparency in the fulfillment process.  I also ordered some Lux cables and thought I would be able to give them as Christmas gifts.  However, now that the October date has been pushed to December, I wonder if I'll have them in time.As an investor during the first Thanksgiving offering, I really hope I didn't make a mistake with Magfast.Response to reply - I have contacted customer service, hence the reason for the review.  They were not able to answer my questions as mentioned in the original review."

Then when I find it , it will very likely be totally dead.. because3. Kids are not inclined enough to take it back down...and charge it when it needs chargingSo... I would be more inclined to proceed if there was a fully wired wall plug that would plug in the block and charge it where ever it was. Yes, it seems more cumbersome, but, when you have a family with 4 kids... This system will constantly be seeing challenges because it's being misplaced, not charged... Or god knows what."

I was extremely impressed with the demo video just now, and I was going to do the buy 3 get the extreme for free so I scrolled to the bottom and clicked the link.  The page then took me to a page where the only option was to rate the product that I haven't even purchased yet, and that raises all sorts of red flags.  It seems as if I'm being held is some sort of internet limbo until I write a review to be taken to the next page where I can THEN select the three Magfast units in order to get the extreme for free.  If this is all wrong and I've somehow gone off path I apologize, but as of right this very second it seems like a shady business practice.  If I turn out to be wrong I will try my hardest to change the review, but for now the impression has tanked since the initial video."

I expected I was going to see something (obviously that had a cord to charge) that I could lay my phone on and it would charge without attaching a cord.  Instead I see all of this with multiple units, all these charging ports that the space station can attach to, power-banks to carry with me, costing hundreds of dollars, and I spent an hour listening to a presentation that I still don't understand.  Will it still charge my phone without me attaching a cord to my phone????  I think this is all geared to more tech savvy, on the go, younger generation.  I am not sure what I would do with it."

Not once in your presentation did you address when these product would be available to ship.  A little research shows that you have been operating and crowd funding since at least 2019 and have yet to ship any product to those customers. I have to wonder what kind of back log you have created!?  Am I being asked to get in line for something I may never received, or that will likely be obsolete when I do finally receive it? One observation that supports this concern - I noticed your Magfast Extreme \u201cin\u201d port is a Micro-USB which is no longer the standard.  I would expect this to be upgraded to a USB-C port.  For a charging station that holds that much power, I can only assume that would take a massive amount of time to reach a full charge on a micro-USB. I would love to be a customer if this is a real product in development.  For now I will wait until I see them actually shipping or available on store shelves."

I have found each of the products I have purchased, that they have delivered, to be of highest quality, lovely to behold, and able to do the job for which they were created to an extremely high level.The only reason I have not given a full-blown 5-star rating is because there are still a couple of products that I have prepaid for that are taking a long time to manufacture and ship. The products that have been manufactured and shipped, however, are totally 5-star!!"

The customer service when I have contacted them has been very informative and quick to respond.  I am still looking forward to receiving my products but worried about the lack of updates in their website and status page.  Scheduled for batch 23 delivery which was supposed to deliver April 21-30 and has been delayed with no updates."

Can\u2019t wait to get my chargers and my luggage. The one area I believe they can improve on is promising delivery time frames. They provided some for the chargers but did not follow through and deliver on it. I\u2019m still waiting for an estimated delivery date for my Family Pro Kit batch number\u2026.. My Lux charging cables are top notch and I love them and I\u2019m confident that the chargers and luggage will be as well."

I have changed my review to a 4. I wish there were 2 categories. I would give the products a 5+ but the shipping a 2 - 3. I understand that the global parts availability was a big factor along with the pandemic interference which I understand is beyond the control of Magfast.

To this date (5years later), I still have not received those orders which have been paid for.Today, I received my order MS10023917, of  Lux cables only to find that 1(one) item was missing from the shipment.Based on their advertising, MAGFAST produces superior products, but their attention to fulfilling placed orders appears to lacking. Customer Service has provided a number of reasons as to why my pre-orders have not been sent, but, really, 5 years is stretching it a bit. As for the cables, I have just contacted their customer service and I am awaiting a reply.I have been contacted by Magfast's Customer Service and have been given detailed reasons for the delay in my pre-orders. I was even offered a refund.I found their explanation plausible and have decided to stay with them until the end. They deserve another chance."

Edit to reply, I understand it's a bonus and in the video seminar I attended it showed an adapter in the box with charge cord. I didn't receive one in my box"

I had a need for this product and it seemed like a worthwhile purchase. The presentation was clear and informative and did a good job of showing the product, basic use and accesories that come with each item. My only issue is that if you have important pre purchase questions, they aren't able to answer them during the webinar and as there's a 30 min timer to purchase at the special price, I had to act or lose out. In fact, although %90 of my questions were answered during the course of the presentation; my two most important questions were not and the host ended by saying that was all the questions they had. I'm going to try reaching out now but it would have been nice to know before the final purchase."

Extreme works great just as promised although I have yet had a chance to jump start a car. The Life works great with cable charging but tends to overheat with Chi charging. I can not charge a Samsung S21 cellphone completely one time via Chi without seeing flashing red lights which mean it is overheating and it shuts down. Charging the same phone via cable works just fine."

So I cant use now until adapter comes. Which to me seems pointless. I was so excited to use my new cable and then order more. I Have a 4 person home with 5 rooms that need new charging capabilities. But now I gotta wait another 2 weeks before I get to try it out. Just doesn't make sense EDIT: Even though I think sending the USB A adapter after the charge cord is kinda ridiculous, because you can't use the cord until you get adapter. Anyway the adapter came very fast as soon as I registered the charge cord. And I am impressed with the cord. It charges faster then the cord my phone came with. Also my laptop did not tell me I was charging slow. Also the feel of the cord I can tell how well this is made. If it last longer then a couple of months (that's how long most cords last after my kids use them), then I'll definitely be recommending and buying more products."

A visitor at the hospital in which I work came to my office requesting assistance with starting his minivan that had a flat battery.  One of my officers took out the large booster box we have and came back twenty minutes later, admitting defeat and complaining the booster was toast and not fit for the purpose - this was the first I became aware of todays situation.Having added my Magfast Extreme to my daily kit for work, took the booster cables which I keep in in my own truck and went out to the broken down minivan.  I was able to quickly connect the leads to the Extreme and then to the vehicles dead battery.  Switched on the Extreme and let it sit for a few seconds.  The visitor switched on his vehicle ignition and hey presto, the minivan started, first time.  The vehicle owner was very impressed and I was happy to have helped him get on his way after a traumatic day at the hospital.Extreme functioned seamlessly and impressed not only the vehicle user but one of my officers that came out to watch.  He's now investigating the options for buying one for himself."

She loved the cord so much that she refuses to give it back it's been a year now and she still has it not only that but she loves it so much that it's something she asked for as a Christmas gift one for the car and one for work. My brother even asked me where I got the cord from and wants one too. The price may be a little high but it's worth it for the quality and lifetime warranty. I love my lux cables I bought 4 more as gifts. The customer service is also great I had to email magfast and they were quick to reply and able to help me out. Can't wait till I get the other stuff I ordered I would definitely recommend magfast to anyone looking for great quality cables."

But, when the Magfast order arrived, wowza, was it a super nice product.  Quick charging and super powerful batteries.  I have tried the MF Extreme to jump start an SUV, no problem, and the MF Life and Air work great at charging multiple devices over Qi.  Extra cable connectors mean that I can pretty much charge any Apple or non apple product, and then some.  I am looking forward to the balance of my order, and hoping it wont take another 4 years....."

They were very informative about starting their company and what they were manufacturing to make our lives  more productive with their products. While lengthy, it needed to be to and to share their vision and products.Magfast shared that their first line of products were still being manufactured and would take quite some time to produce with all the orders they were receiving. I was extremely excited about the products they shared with us and pre-ordered the Magfast Family Pro Kit. They explained that we would receive our orders in the order they were placed and it would be quite some time before they would be shipped. Delays in parts have pushed them farther behind. But their products will be worth the wait. Hope I\u2019ll receive them before Christmas."

Thus far I am delighted with the LIFE and AIR which I am using right now to charge my iPhone 13 Pro. My extreme power bank came with two of the 10 LEDs lit up so it\u2019s at low charge and I\u2019m charging it now even nearly 10 hours later it is still charging but then again this is the largest and most powerful of the MAGFAST chargers which is alleged to be able to re-charge a car\u2019s battery.I have confidence in the company because I have frequently received emails updating me as to the progress and addressing delays, of which there have been many yet, again this is to be expected and the product comes in quality packaging and appears to be very solid and well functioning.  Nay sayers be quiet and be patient.  If it\u2019s taking too long, you can opt for a return of your funds by cancelling your order.   I did not take that option because I recognised that this was a good deal, even if it took three years to receive it."

          "Contenu": "Hi there world of tech. Just wanted to throw down some words about an experience I had with one of the products I had purchased from the company with the name of Magfast. I figure most points of contact would like to know how their performance was in resolving an issue that a customer has had with their product I know I do, so here it goes. I have purchased 2 of the pro kits from the company and must say I love them, hence 2 kits not just one. But that's not where my issue developed. I purchased one of the Lux charging cords to go with them. The item charged my phone faster than any previous cords I have used. I was a happy man. After about three months or so and many hours of charging while using, I suddenly hear my phone go per-ding, like I had just plugged it into the charger. Wait WHAT it's already plugged in so why is it per-dinging? I brush it off and continue trying to see how fast I can get my Amazon order here. Then again per-ding, oh Hell no my phone's charging port better not be going out. So while I'm on Amazon I might as well order a 90 degree charging extension cord plug, hoping to relieve the stressed port. The item arrived the next morning between 4am-8am Thank You Amazon. But No change in the issue. Now Magfast has a 25,000 bends test and by no means have I exceeded that. Out comes the continuity checker and bingo, it's shorting out. Customer service time, I contact the company about the isolated incident and after answering a few questions a new cord arrived at my doorstep almost as fast as Amazons package did. Once again a happy man emerges from the phone charging depths of the unknown. Thank You Magfast for the rather fast response resolving the issue. The moral off the story and only con about the whole experience, MAGFAST PLEASE!!! PLEASE!!!! produce a 90 degree adaptor for your LUX PREMIUM charging cords. And to all of the interested that let me bend your ear for that long I would like to take a moment to Thank you all for taking the time out of your busy schedule to read about my experience, I appreciate you all.Spread the LovePeace OutArt \"Like On The Wall\""

The Lux cables are a perfect compliment. MagFast is doing a lot of things right and their customer service is second to none."
