We call they lie about why the bus is not there and say they will get a closer company to pickup to reduce coming 3hrs from original destination. Time goes by they say the bus is on the way. Nothing. We call a d they are working on an \"issue\". 3 hrs later still no bus Charter Up says it's still going to be an hour. We booked a shuttle company we saw at the port. It was a mess and never again will we use Charter Up. They also wash their hands of refunds or doing anything to make it right."

They screwed up itinerary, charged me over $3300 to pick up 54 clients take them LITERALLY a mile up the road to say driver had another job, and had to leave. The driver was suppose to stay all day and transport the clients to a couple places, as well as the next morning and take them back home. I tried to cancel the next day trip since first one was COMPLETELY SCREWED UP and they refused saying need 72 hours notice, even though I literally just booked them 3-4 hours earlier. D+ Better Business Bureau Rating says it all. Read complaints on BBB!!!! Run and I mean LITERALLY run from this company! Management sucks too, they do nothing to fix their screws up, no partial refunds NOTHING. I didn't even sign a contract with them and still got stuck with. $3300 bill for a 1/2 a$$ job that was partially done. Book through bus company directly not this bus broker!!!"

          "Contenu": "We had hoped that this year they would respectfully honor what they said the year before.  Yes, this year, AGAIN, they sent the bus THEY thought we needed vs the bus we actually needed and paid for.  This mistake created additional costs because we had a duty to provide reasonable accommodations for our employees with special needs.  To resolve they offered a minimal monetary resolution.  Very disappointing from a company that claims to have such high ratings.  Please do the research and hope they contract with better bus companies that are serious about the services they provide. JUST a bus is not the goal, the right bus we paid for IS.  We weren't asking for anything free, just what we paid for. We are still trying to resolve this matter 12 days later but they say it may take 30.  Best wishes for CharterUp because we do support companies that want to do better and we hope they do the right thing since this is a good business model if they can improve the communication and QC.  This was strike two for us and not sure we have the luxury to offer a third.  Have a pleasant day and be cautious."

Everything was fine on the way there, but on the way back the bus only made one of three pickups at the venue. This was clearly outlined on the itinerary and there was no contact at all from the bus company about the driver not returning. They kept telling us to wait and wait. This was over a week ago at an outside venue! This left our guest stranded in the cold of the night with no plan from CharterUp on how to send another bus. The bus made one pick up at 8:30 and did not return after that for another two pickups. Absolutely unforgivable. The dispatch could not explain what happened. I had to have more than 10 of my guests get out of bed at 1am to pick up and perform the job I hired them to do. They continuously gave us incorrect times telling us to wait and see and no bus ever appeared. This was a wedding night ruined."

When I spoke with Charter Up, they blamed the local company, who in turn blamed Charter Up. Charter Up has never responded to my follow-ups about how to remedy this situation. We spent almost $4,000 on buses for one evening, going to two locations, and Charter Up is avoiding its responsibility as the organizer. I will never be using their services again."

The bus that arrived was significantly not as described - it had none of those amenities, old cloth seats, looked like it was barely working, terrible suspension. Charterup promises a good bus then bait and switches with a terrible bus. Contacting customer service gets no response or help. If you book with them you'll end up with a terrible bus at a high price and only have yourself to blame."

For our trouble, Charter Up offered a paltry $150 - while insisting they owed us nothing, because the terms and conditions state that they will not guarantee the bathrooms on board will actually work. Any reputable bus company would have made this right. Charter Up is NOT a bus company; they are a broker. They take a hands-off approach if your bus company turns out to under-deliver. Save the money you'll pay as a commission to them and book directly. Clearly they don't screen the bus companies they use; they just want your money."

When they did call back they offered $400 and a $1000 credit towards a future trip.  $400 is a far cry from the $2300 they cost my students- not to mention the headache of planning another trip.

          "Contenu": "We were planning a high school trip for a title 1 (low income) school in a suburb of Dallas, TX to Orlando last year. We received a quote from Charterup in May and put down a $3200 deposit. We used the price quote we were given to set the total package price for the trip so our students could start saving for it over the summer. The kids came back to school in August excited about the trip. It quickly filled up at the price that was advertised with everyone paying their deposits. In October, we received an email from Charterup saying that their supplier had to cancel our reservation and they would need to increase the price by over 35%. We called the supplier directly and they told us that they had never accepted a reservation from Charterup for our high school. We reached out to initial sales person that booked our reservation and she committed over the phone to honoring our price but later that day we got a call from a supervisor saying that our salesperson was not authorized to commit to that and that the best they could do was a price 17% higher than what we committed to in May which \"was their cost\". It was an increase per student of over $40 for their trip to Orlando. Eventually, we were able to find another charter company that came in lower than Charterup's best price (but still higher than our original price) and we cancelled our reservation with them. The only good thing about them is that they do have a generous cancellation policy so we were able to get our deposit back. We do a trip every year and we will never use Charterup again. Buyer beware that when you sign up with Charterup they have no obligation to honor the price they quote and they may change the price on you and just blame it on their suppliers, even if it isn't the suppliers fault. Best to work directly with the charter companies so you don't have to worry about these surprise price hikes."

We reserved a bus with 4.6 stars and 30+ reviews. 2 days before the pickup CharterUp says the bus company canceled so they picked someone else without us knowing.  No communication was given to us about the change, spent $15k for a nice bus with good reviews. Instead CharterUp picked us a lemon of a bus with no AC. We were on a bus for 18hrs in June heading from NC to Dallas. I notified CharterUp of the issue and they have yet to reach out to me after telling me on the phone, \u201cthe perk with going through CharterUp is that if a bus breaks down they can use their vast network to get a new bus really quickly.\u201d I hope they prove me wrong but as of today I\u2019d stay clear of them and book direct. **Update: the bus company CharterUp provided us is not worth the money we spent. The bus was held together with zip ties and duct tape. The drivers were incompetent and didn\u2019t know how to navigate (went 1.5hrs off course), drivers made us late to a scheduled event, AC wasn\u2019t working for half the trip, the bus broke down, the bus owner is rude and disrespectful. Stay away from CharterUp, they\u2019re not accepting any responsibility for choosing this bus without our consent."

CharterUp LIED and said the bus company was trying to reach me by phone for days and sent me an email. That is an inexcusable false claim (cell phones keep a record of every call in and every missed call). Also, they accepted an additional payment within the window they claim they were trying to reach me because we wanted to add an hour onto what we had booked! Neither GoGo nor CharterUp ever called me to discuss the cancelation or offer options. They confirmed they had my number correctly on the two contracts. They accept no responsibility. They provide no backup plan for cancellation. They do not engage any resources on my behalf. They have held my money in BAD FAITH for three months. CharterUp has cornered the market so one cannot book any of this transportation directly and then they have no backup plan for when they FAIL. Horrid customer service. Promised to call me by 8 pm and never did. I see now that they have cited this same \"driver issues\" for other customers and have also canceled them by email. CharterUp has a ruined reputation and should stop hosting transportation partners who do not provide contracted services. They like to say they are like \"Expedia\" but if an Expedia-booked hotel does not accommodate you, you get \"walked\" to another resort not abandoned. Expedia is awful and they are far worse. CharterUP should not be trusted with your money or guaranteed to show up for your scheduled service. This was for two dates, two contracted service agreements that they violated."

          "Contenu": "I reserved a bus with CharterUp to travel on June 25, 2022, from VA to PA to attend a play at Sight and Sound. When I reserved the bus, it was my expectation that the bus would be working properly, safe, secure, and comfortable. We paid for a working bus with AC. The AC went out in 88-degree weather, and it was extremely hot and very uncomfortable. However, CharterUp informed me that they do not ensure the buses are operating properly and that's not their responsibility. CharterUp is a 3rd party company whereas consumers can use them as the middleman to reserve charter buses for travel. Therefore, they partner with companies that have non-working buses. This is very unprofessional on CharterUp\u2019s part. I informed CharterUp about the issue and their only recourse was to offer $100 refund. We\u2019re not able to discuss the issue with the bus company because our contract is with CharerUp. Since we reserved the bus from CharterUp they get the bad review for not making sure the buses they send for travel are working properly with working AC. CharterUp decided to partner with bus companies who are not replicable and hold value in putting working buses on the road. CharterUp provides a service and then said it is not their responsibility that the service works? This is a learning experience for me not to use 3rd party sources. When we travel again by bus I will research and find a bus service that I can reserve directly with them. I do not recommend ChartUp bus services and will not use their service again. My issue is not resolved, and I have to call back on July 5, 2022 to speak with a manager."

Our reservation number was 430015.We hired CharterUp to take our Wedding guests from the Hotel to our Wedding venue in May 2022. We had to pay in full a month before the Wedding. The Wedding was on June 4th 2022 & on May 25th 2022 we contacted CharterUp with the final count of people & wanted to change pick up at the Wedding venue from 11:00pm to 11:30pm. We were told to do this through their website & we did that. On Wednesday June 1st, CharterUp called us & said they did not have any drivers at that point for our reservation because the drivers did not want to drive past 11pm. The representative said she would be in contact with us ASAP. CharterUp\u2019s policy is if you do not cancel your reservation within 72 hours of your reservation date, you have TO PAY IN FULL & get no refund. As of Friday afternoon June 3rd (Day before the Wedding), we could not contact the representative after many phone calls & email attempts. The emails said she was out of the office. We had to make the decision Friday evening June 3rd to hire another charter company at the last minute. We cancelled Charterup via email since we still had not heard back from them & they could not be reached by phone. On Saturday June 4th (day of Wedding) we FINALLY heard back via email from our representative at Charterup & she was just confirming that we were canceling. Because we canceled inside the 72 hour policy, we were NOT refunded our money of $1879.00 even though we were told before the 72 hour window that CHARTERUP had no drivers for our reservation & they were trying to find other drivers & would notify us ASAP. We never heard back from them. Our representative tried to get their manager AR_ _R  H_RR_ _ to refund us because she had called us outside the 72 hour window to tell us they had no drivers. He refused!! I tried to speak with the manager on 5 separate occasions & he refused to speak with me each time. It is just a matter of time before the poor customer service at Charterup catches up with them. We have since learned that we are not the only ones that were treated so poorly & in the meantime we are out almost $2000 for a service we NEVER RECEIVED!!Save yourself A LOT of heartache & money & DO NOT BOOK CHARTERUP!!"

          "Titre": "Miserable Wedding Experience with CharterUp",
          "Contenu": "I had a bad experience using CharterUp for my wedding. I used CharterUp to schedule a bus to take guests to my wedding venue from a nearby hotel, and two buses to return guests back to the hotel at the end of the night - one at 11:30pm and one at 12:30am the following day. It's worth noting that CharterUp is not a bus company - they are an agent that provides quotes and allows you to book with one of many bus companies that they work with. While your bus will be operated by another company, your only contact will be with CharterUp. The bus taking guests to the wedding showed up on time, but things went downhill a bit from there. The driver had to ask my guests for the destination and directions, got lost, and told my guests that my wedding venue was closed and that he couldn't take them there. Despite giving the bus an hour to complete a 20-30 minute drive (approximately 8 miles), these guests still showed up just minutes before our start time. Some of these guests were so turned off by this experience that they elected to take Ubers for their return trip - little did they know this would end up being a wise choice. At around midnight on the night of my wedding I found out that the 11:30pm return bus had never arrived. At this point I started to get worried about the 12:30am bus, so I checked into my reservation details. It turns out that the buses were scheduled 24 hours later than they were supposed to be. As a result, all of my guests who needed transportation ended up taking Ubers. While it was annoying spending the last 30 minutes of my wedding worrying about if my guests would make it back to the hotel, it ended up working out and everyone was fine with taking Ubers. I contacted CharterUp later that night to let them know that the bus never arrived due to an error in scheduling. I figured this would be an easy situation to clear up and that I'd be able to receive a refund for the buses that didn't show up. CharterUp responded that they could not refund the money because their cancellation policy is 48 hours. Of course it would have been impossible to cancel 48 hours in advance of the incorrectly scheduled bus, since I didn't realize it wasn't going to show up until day of. They also claimed that the scheduling error was my fault, despite the fact that I clearly dictated over the phone the dates and times of the buses, as well as that the buses were to take guests to and from a wedding. To imply that I asked for a bus to pick my guests up 30 hours after I had them dropped off for a wedding is absurd - we like a good party but let's be real. Ultimately since most of the transacting was done over the phone, I could not put up a case against them to get a refund and ended up eating the entire charge. I can forgive the rough bus ride to the venue - everyone made it on time and they have some funny stories as a result - and I understand how the mistake was made on the return trip. But to stonewall me and not even offer a partial refund or credit is unacceptable. Even if the company wants to claim the error was my fault, to not realize they are partially to blame is absurd - they are the ones who enter the dates and times into their system. The result of this is that I spent close to $1200 for a single 8 mile bus ride, and spent the end of my wedding night trying to get in touch with CharterUp to find out where the buses were.If you're going to book a bus, look elsewhere. Find a small local company that values the customer experience and takes accountability for their actions.Edit January 25th 2022: Within hours of me posting this review on this site and one other, CharterUp started the process of disputing it. Even after providing names, order numbers, and pictures of my credit card activity with CharterUp they told this site that they could not find evidence that I am a legitimate customer. I was eventually able to provide enough evidence for this review to remain active, but be aware that there are likely other negative reviews that you can't see because of the high burden placed upon reviewers to verify their reviews. Also, I find it interesting that CharterUp is more active in attempting to keep their reviews positive through contesting reviews than they are in trying to provide a good service for their customers to begin with."

I hope that our situation is unique and that we just received a \"lemon\" of a driver and shuttle and that others have a more positive experience.We hired a shuttle to transport guests to/from our wedding last month and are extremely displeased with the service we received. I had a great experience making and confirming the reservation, however, our positive experience ended on our wedding day. The point of hiring a shuttle for our guests was to ensure they had a safe and convenient way of attending our wedding. The service received was neither safe, nor convenient. The driver drove over curbs, slammed on the breaks, took numerous on and off ramps instead of staying on the highway, backed over mailboxes and tried to perform a multipoint turn on a two lane, busy road - all of this happened before the wedding even began! The first words we heard from our guests were things like \"Thank goodness we made it here alive.\" Unfortunately, the experience got worse. The radiator gave out on the return trip. The driver exited the bus on the highway in the dark without turning on the hazard lights, which were ultimately engaged by a passenger. They sat on the side of the highway for nearly two hours waiting for another shuttle to come pick them up. What should have been a 45 minute ride took 2.5 hours. Fortunately the replacement bus and driver that finally arrived was very professional and had no further issues. I understand that unexpected things can happen but the worst part of all of this was that when we contacted CharterUp to tell them about our experience, they responded with the contract excerpts saying they take no responsibility for any of the events that happened other than a property damage claim for the mailboxes. I understand CharterUp is not directly responsible for the transportation provided, but you would think that for being a \"transportation marketplace\" they would care about the safety and satisfaction of their clients."

All was good and I was assured this would be sooth and we would have support on the day of. The day of the wedding we received notice of our Driver in the morning. I attempted to call early afternoon to confirm service time and schedule with this driver to make sure all was in place.  The driver did not pick up, or call back. The shuttle was 10 minutes late for the first shuttle service. We had to call customer support, who told us to call and leave the driver a message (he may be driving - reasonable). The driver never did pick up, just arrived late and was unaware of his job for the day and needed to be instructed by our guests. We had 3 people spending the last 30 minutes prior to the ceremony trying to contact the drive and customer service. Ceremony had to be delayed. The shuttle service that was to be provided after the wedding was to be continuous. However, the driver proceeded to take a nap and needed to be awaken for the first shuttle and refused to take guests an hour later. I contacted my customer service agent, who again was kind and he said he passed my concerns on to their customer support team who would get back to me.  After 3 months and an additional request, I have not heard from them at all. I paid for continuous service that was late and not 100% provided. Would not use a booking service for an event like this again."

Thank you CharterUp for making things right! _______Original Review:We booked Charter Up to shuttle guests from a local parking lot to our wedding at a private residence a year ahead of time. The drive in total was about 1 mile and very simple. The beginning went ok and everyone made it to the ceremony, but the evening took a hard turn.We had booked the returns to the lot from 9-11 pm to go back and forth continuously. Our driver did not come back and pick up guests as per our contract,\u00a0stating that the residential area he had dropped them off in was \"too dark\". We\u00a0lost a full hour of rides and had to call him and plead with him several times during the event to come back and finish out the service. Our wedding coordinator also had to shuttle people back and forth from the parking lot at which they had left their cars while waiting for him. 20+ people were left stranded including elderly handicapped people and people who were pregnant. When he finally agreed to finish out his job, he didn't come down the home's driveway and people had to walk 1/4 mile to where he was in order for him to drive them back to the original pick up point. This location is an incredibly safe and well kept gated residential community, and he had done the trip earlier in the evening - not sure what the issue was but it took away from our evening immensely.\u00a0To top it off the day after the event we got an automated email that he went \u201c40 mins overtime\u201d and charged our card for the overage."
