          "Contenu": "I don't want to give a bad review, but we've used Co-Construct for many months now and I can't really say it's worth the money.  There doesn't seem to be much adaptability for different or custom projects - and really nothing at all for a GC who performs both commercial and residential renovations and TI's.  Sorry Co-Co, I had higher expectations and had hoped to find a software where I didn't have to input and revise the entire schedule to suit how project sequence flows in the real world.The original demo sold it for me, but the reality lost it for me.  I'd love to see Co-Co lower their price significantly to compete, and provide some better offerings and functionality for small GC's.  There still is potential but the software needs a lot of work."

It is also not a money saver, the cost is quite high compared to the amount of return we feel that we get.  The mobile app and time clock features are also unreliable and my crew hates the app because it is slow to load for log in and log out."

There are 20 plus members of just my club, with many more 20 clubs and there is a large majority of members that are using Co Construct.  There should be some special pricing for this group.2. Buildertrend seems to have put some more time into product development lately, such as implementing the WIP (work in progress) form and having it link directly to the jobs in progress and with Quickbooks, tempting to switch.3. Just some advice from the outside, Co Construct was great two years ago and it seems like you're relying on the past to keep you going.  New development is key, communicate to your clients what developments you're working on.4.  My team was at IBS this last year and we are one of the company's that is \"all in\" with Co Construct.  We brought some ideas to the table and some were received and you told us you're working on them, others were not deemed that important.  Like any good company, you need to have a rep assigned to each company and have them reaching out to us on monthly basis to see how things are going.You can call me at 517-388-2841 to discuss any of the above items."

          "Contenu": "I have been using CoConstruct for about 9 months and I am still not 100% sold on the program. There have definitely been some components that I have found need to be worked on. The majority of these issues have to do with change orders.1) It is quite difficult to confirm whether line items include profit and overhead or not without toggling back and forth from the estimate view. I usually have to have a notepad, check the estimate view, write down the pricing breakdown, toggle back to the change order and verify.2) The client view seems to lump everything together and we often get complaints of wanting to see the pricing broken down into line items.3) If you enter a \"new item\" into a change order and save it as a draft it doe snot allow you to go in and edit the item. You have to delete it and start from scratch.4) When an selection has a change order tied to it you can no longer open the detail box. Can't this be opened as \"read only\"?5) Aside from those issues we've had numerous issues with emails. We haven't been able to enter all of our clients because someone else who uses coconstruct, through another company, also has that email entered. This seems rather silly and limiting.6) I'd like to see better options for repeat clients and clients who have multiple projects. It seems like I have to create a new login for each project and they just end up getting spammed with new welcome emails. I'd love to see these areas improved as they leave me wondering if I should look into different software."

Unfortunately, the system has not kept up with trends in technology by focusing on usability improvement of the existing platform versus a focus on regular launch of new features that may/may not be as useful as the base platform.  Simple improvements to the existing platform's functionality would dramatically improve useability.  Examples would be 1) being able to choose whether vendors receive notifications of changes to to-dos, schedule items, etc., 2) ability to sort selections by room, 3) Full functionality in the mobile app, 4) respond and fix bugs more quickly, and well as a handful of other easy improvements."

Basic training provided in video or in person opportunities have been fantastic.  The networking at CoCon events is a big plus.

In spite of their imperfections I have to say that they seem to be constantly working on adding useful features and improving their process.  As my initial policy I decided I would attempt to use EVERY button and feature they had available.  It took 2 years to get there but as our business grew there was nothing about the software that hasn't proven itself useful which is not what I normally find in similar cases.  Their customer service is excellent.  When you call they answer or actually call you back very quickly if you leave a message.  When you talk to them they actually have good advice and can actually answer your questions.  Thats not typical in this world either.  I don't like the price but they do work hard to make you WANT to keep paying for their service instead of just holding you to a contract they talked you into agreeing to. At the end of the day I think that's what its all about!"

The 360 degree photos have proved to be invaluable in finding buried outlets and other issues that arise. As the project manager, I find that issuing purchase orders is a snap when I have my estimate data entered the way I want it to appear on the PO.  Specification changes and Change Orders are a much improved process over the old way of doing things, and everything is logged for reference.  The CoConstruct team is excellent; well-trained, responsive, collaborative and engaged.  Love them!"

No more double entries!! Onboarding may appear daunting but honestly, you are never finished. You simply can't keep up because the CC team is ALWAYS pushing out new features and updates. Seriously, always. If a part of the program isn't working to the best of its ability, they already know about it. Odds are, they are going to have resolved in the next round of updates. Their customer support is hands down the easiest to work with. You are literally on the phone with a real human, who speaks fluid English, knows their product, and eager to help you navigate through whatever obsitcal; in a matter of seconds. The program allows us to maintain our margins while providing enough transparency for clients to make informed decisions. The management team sincerely wants to understand your needs and will move mountains to ensure your up and running smoothly-- shout out to Spencer! All in all, the investment is worth it and we highly recommend it."
