I tried to buy BTCs with this company for my wallet in Bitcoin.com.What is surprising is that a couple of days after completing the tedious verification process and sending the money, my transaction was rejected/cancelled!!No one answers me via email, only the automatic reply. And yes, of course I LOST money because by sending it to a UK location from an EU country, a fee was charged -> and obscene quantity for this kind of transaction but unfortunately this depends on your bank, and not MoonPay.First question that comes to my mind: why did they allow me to complete the long verification/registration process to reject my purchase after paying it? Hope you find out before you buy the first time."

I think this is absolute rubbish and also a security breach of my personal information. I sent 3 recent payslips that has all my details on there which also has my bank account number and employee number. I pretty much got stuffed around by this company. Prior to this I sent a copy of my drivers license. So it almost looks like identity theft regarding the information they are requesting. I never had this issue when I first used this platform, but just recently because I was trying to send funds to my brother to pay towards his medical bill but my account was blocked until further verification. If this was the case, why was it not addressed earlier? I have heard negative reviews about MoonPay, but at the time  I was satisfied with the service. Now that I\u2019ve experienced all these issues, I agree with the reviews and will be sure to warn others not to use this app cause they don\u2019t look after their clients and they\u2019re based in the Seychelles."

I am a NHS staff , therefore, trust me stay away from anything related with cryptocurrency with that company. I will happily take them to court. Customer service reply takes minimum of 2 hours.

I barely use their services and just for small sums. Lack of untrasparency, really long waiting in chat, lack of communication from their side makes me say: steer away from this company!"

I made a transaction of more than $1k to be exact among the fees that they charged me to my bank account has to enter $1252. That transaction had a deadline from 30 minutes to 48 hours to be clarified and I have my funds. Today 12/12/2023 I have been creating incredible financial instability why that money  that they have not returned me they had personal reasons such as stability not only mine but of a family with small children who Because of the lack of respect and the professional ethics that they do not have ethics or respect the rights of the consumer and I hope that they have not stolen it because I have been trying to talk for three days With their help to the client and there is no response from them, a message that tells me that nothing happens at all. I seriously do not recommend this service for anything in the world, I wish no one what I have been going so badly with that company that I think is a thief or does not respect the integrity of a person . I would like as soon as possible that someone would help me to solve this situation with companies like these that do not comply with consumer rights. That someone give me information on where I can complain and file a claim and lawsuit against them for the damages they have caused me. It's already more than two days that M\u00e1ximo could have taken to clarify my funds from a supposedly 30-minute instant transaction now takes more than three days.\u200a\u200a\u200a\u200a\u200a\u200a\u200a\u200a\u200a\u200a\u200a\u200a\u200a\u200a\u200a\u200a\u200a\u200a\u200a\u200a\u200a\u200a\u200a\u200a\u200a I seriously need the help of someone attentively and thanks Andy Bustamante"
