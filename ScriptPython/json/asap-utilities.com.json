The MCSE or the developer of the add-in? You feel free to answer that question for yourselves, but the MCSE certainly has no vested interest in a review of the Excel installation... For the record, the version of the add-in currently installed is the most recent."

As he already offers a free version for personal use, it's unlikely it would harm his market share to publicly share some of the code used in his program. As someone who learns best by reverse engineering; I would love the opportunity to see how such a fine product was put together."

I took away one star for one feature I wish they had and that is the ability to make QR codes.

          "Contenu": "Overall, it is a good app which can speed up our tasks. But, it would be better if the scripts also help user to sort while using Sheets > #8 tool. One of another famous tools is not required to do sorting step.Apart from this, the app is easily hang these days when the app is running on specific worksheet which contains screenshots on OTHER worksheets. If user click ESC to cancel the job, it took a while to resume and screenshots on other worksheets might crashed (became \"see through\" screenshot). Please look into this.Thanks.22 Apr 19: Thanks for the reply. I read through but I don't use camera tool that found in customize ribbon. We only have normal screenshots (not linked picture) pasted from SnagIt tool (external tool). :)22 Apr 19: Thanks for the prompt feedback. I may send the sample file after it is ready (but not now or this week due to I have to remove lot of confidential data). The picture tool (external tool) we using to get the screenshots were purchased from  https://'www'.'techsmith.com'/download/oldversions > SnagIt 12.0.0 (remove the '' to get the full link).Once again, thanks for follow up."

          "Contenu": "We're fanatical about ASAP-Utilities. If your daily grind includes using Excel to clean up data from external sources, making data from multiple sources play nice, or providing data to other parties quickly and cleanly, you need these tools. Large-scale edits can be done fast and efficiently. My most used time-savers: remove leading, trailing, and excessive spaces, fill empty cells below, convert formulas in selection to their calculated value, divide data to a new worksheet at every change of a given cell, provide a list of all formulas used in the workbook along with cell reference, clear all (or just a specified) type of formatting/object/hyperlink. Then there's the file folder listing. I never thought about how useful a worksheet breaking down the files included in a given Windows file folder could be!I've tried a lot of Excel add-ons in my 25 years in this job and this is the only of these tools I include in my annual budget, just in case a new version comes out. It's a steal, too! We've been using it for at least a decade and it just keeps getting better."
