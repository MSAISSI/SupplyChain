Contacted ghostek. - they were very slow to reply. Eventually a replacement was sent, that turned up with guess what - an even more broken clip. Now I have 2 useless cases and still out of pocket over $100NZD.  Apparently I can get a refund if I ship the case back to the USA, but to do that would cost the majority of what I would be refunded anyway. Take your money and spend it elsewhere."

Using DHL as the shipping company was mistake number one. I have sent an email to customer service but that obviously didn\u2019t help at all. I stare everyday at my brand new iPhone 15 that I cannot use without a case. Had I known that it would be this long I would have ordered elsewhere. Very disappointed with this."

Certainly, it attaches well but the problem is that when you want to charge your smartphone by induction, well\u2026. it doesn't recharge. Maybe the shell is too thick, I don't know. In addition, the most problematic thing about this protective case is that it drains your phone. I'm not a materials engineer but I assume the aluminum part must have something to do with this problem. It\u2019s really a shame! I was not expecting that at all\u2026"

On the hinge protector there should be 4 prongs connecting the left case to the right,top to bottom, but it only had 3 so when you put it together on the phone it just detaches at the bottom. Sent them pics of the problem and they said they would send me a new one but that would be my one time replacement. So I wait and the next one comes and goes what same problem, they didn't even look in the box to make sure this one right. On the first one it comes with a qr scanner for directions and it only took me to YouTube with no video. So now I am 3 weeks in and still no working case and waiting to get my money back! Will never order from. This company again. I get it mistakes happen but apparently this $60 CHEAPLY MADE CASE has a defect in the way they make. Plus if you screw up once check the replacement before sending it out, this has been very inconvenient and I am sticking with outerbox from now on!"

          "Contenu": "I do not like leaving negative reviews but Ghostek had terrible customer service.  Did not help one bit in resolving an issue.  Not one bit.Update: Don't let them fool you.  I did NOT place an order after requesting 50% off.  Ghostek sent out an email where you had to try and find the 50% off code on a word find puzzle.  There was so many different words to try.  I tried at least 15 of them.  When I went to submit another word, the screen on my phone adjusted and I ended up hitting order instead of submit code.   I IMMEDIATELY contacted Ghostek customer service via their website AND Facebook messenger to alert them of the issue.   Immediately.  They do not provide a phone number to contact customer service anywhere.  I told them the situation and that I'd like to cancel my order or keep the order of they would honor the promo.They, conveniently for them, contacted later, after it was in the \"shipping process\" and asked for the email that contained the word find for the promo code.  I immediately sent it to them and they responded they couldn't do anything.  Didn't offer me any kind of discount. Just said I could pay to return the case.Why also would you send out an email with a word find in which there could be 100 different words that may be the correct option??  Just want to waste everyone's time or just hope they accidentally hit purchase instead of clicking the button to submit the code??  Unprofessional all around."

Save money and be budget to resend the order with the same garbage courier they used, imagine waiting another 20 days for your order to go missing again. Trust issues for real.

Unapologetic and very rude customer service made us not even want to try or reccomend Ghostek products ever again.**Photos were sent with pictures of the packing slip and contents the very first email to Catherine. She replied with a very smug email implying she is doing me a favor this one time...(I recieved an iPhone mini case, and ordered a Note 20 ultra case....). Her rudeness was the reason we initiated a return and not an exchange. We understand mistakes are made, but when you blame the consumer, that's just bad business. Catherine's bad customer service is why we will not reccomend or use Ghostek products."

Scratches on the lens covers.I sent several messages to the company without even a courtesy reply. So all the problems and very poor customer service I can not recommend this case for anyone."

However, they refunded my money for the case maybe I\u2019m wrong but I felt like waiting seven days and I had to email to check on the status of order. So my main complaint was someone waited seven days even though I had a shipping confirmation to tell me that they no longer sold it so why send a shipment confirmation that it had shipped when it really didn\u2019t. I run a company I understand customer service I totally do so I feel like I should\u2019ve gotten a case comped because nobody asked me if I wanted to refund or order something else at equal lesser value."

Even though the confirmation email said my product was shipped on July 15th (from New Jersey), I only received it today (July 27);2. Because I never received a response to TWO \"Contact Us\" messages that I sent ghostek re: the product that I ordered, my wife ordered another case through Amazon yesterday & that product was at my door TODAY (meanwhile it took ghostek 13 days to deliver their product); and, lastly,3. The \"Tracking\" info. that ghostek sent me was absolutely bogus.  When I clicked on the Tracking button (which I did numerous times over the past 13 days). all it ever said to me was, \"En Route\" & I had no way of finding out how close it was to being delivered to my door.  Additionally, when I went to DHL's website directly & put in the crappy Tracking number that was provided to me by ghostek, their website said the number was erroneous!All-in-all, a very frustrating experience buying a ghostek product (but they certainly have the right name - the company is \"ghost-like\" in their delivery & communication with their clients)!  I will not be shopping for any products offered by this company again & I will be leaving a Google review too!Bert."

I feel like the grey plastic needs to be less smooth, either change of material or add texture to it so you don\u2019t drop it. It does have little plastic strips either side of the case but they are made out of the same smooth plastic and are almost flush with the metal part of the case, so don\u2019t really do much.I will be changing out my case asap. I feel like with the lack of overall coverage with how slippery this case is I am going to drop my phone and break the damn thing."

But then just a week into having the case on my phone, my inside screen started becoming unresponsive to my Spen and touch from fingers. I then used the \"create a note\" feature and covered every area of the inner screen with the pen. This was when I realized that the two magnets from the Covert's Binger protection had ruined my screen in the exact two areas of where the magnets are with the phone unfolded, and the two ruined circular areas on my inside screen are about the size of a half dollar coin. As a result of this, I'm not able to file a warranty claim and have to use an insurance claim that is going to cost me $250 to replace my zfold4, and it's not by fault from me that I'm having to spend money because of a problem caused by the Ghostek Covert case. The customer service response to my problem was not treated with care nor was this problem escalated to higher authorities in the Ghostek management team."

It took almost 2 weeks for my order to arrive, with very little assistance from customer service except to \"wait longer\" and a tracking link that I already had.  When my order finally arrived I was very disappointed in the product. The wallet is not flexible and only holds a couple cards and is cumbersome to use. The detachable feature needs work as well. The NRG mount was the most disappointing. The magnet isn't strong enough to hold my phone and case without any cards in the wallet. It was completely unusable.  I immediately boxed it all back up for return. Additionally, they sent a card with a QR code for instructions but the video that was supposed to be linked was not available.**In response to the company reply, when asked by trustpilot I updated info in my review to include my order number 137241. Only holding 3 cards would not be a huge problem but the wallet makes it cumbersome and difficult to access the cards. Taking the wallet off is easy but it doesn't go back on as easily.  As far as the NRG mount concerns, I was searching your site by device and that mount came up as an accessory.  While I am not happy with the product or shipping time, I remain hopeful that the return process won't be too difficult."

I gave the case to my husband who does not use a fingerprint with his phone. If you fix that problem this would be a \ud83d\udcaf % great case all the way around."

So I purchased the nautical slim for my iPhone 14.  Fit is good. Waterproof as expected. Button control is much better than the iPhone 8 design in which the silence mode dial is useless.  However, I totally forgot about how poor the customer service is.  I never heard back on warranty for my iPhone 8 case that the charge port rubber plug failed.  The only way to contact them is email.  They don\u2019t read the whole email before responding. Which then takes additional emails and time to get an appropriate answer.  Glad I finally did receive my new cases.  They look like they will stand up."

          "Contenu": "To be honest, I was a bit disappointed in the case but I am trying to get used to it. A few things that could be made better:1. The case only attaches near the hinge but the hinge is pretty tight so when I go to open the case, it often slips off the front of the phone - not to the point where it completely dislodges but enough to be annoying.2. The bezel is thick enough that it covers the navigation button at the bottom of the screen. I often have to try 3 or 4 times to swipe off an app.3. The card case is a little too thin to be helpful. Ideally, I could travel without a wallet if I could carry my license, swipe card and 1 CC but I can only fit 2 of the 3 so I need to carry a wallet anyway.4. It would also be helpful if the card case attached in either direction so you could kickstand the phone in more than one orientation, but the magnet only works in 1 specific place.5. The hinge cover is odd - it just sort of flops around and feels unfinished. Would be better if it were a little tighter and less bulky - maybe even use a vinyl cover that's contiguous with the front and back cover?"

I reached out to customer care because the case absolutely does not work and the magnetic wallet holder turns off the main screen no matter what you do. The adhesive does not work for this specific case as well as the hinge protector is a floating hinge protector that does not actually connect to the phone and wobbles back and forth. These are huge issues for a phone like this, especially a phone that cost $1,800. The case is $60 and I emailed them so they can replace the case with a different case. Instead of replacing the case with something that works, they sent me the exact same non-functional case. I don't know if I can trust them again if this is not rectified. If they rectify the situation, I will be happy to change this review and update everyone on the outcome."

I would expect a bit better quality for the money. For how much it costs, it should be nearly perfect, and mine just isn't which is disappointing. I get the feeling that the small piece of leather will be the first part that fails and makes me question the long-term durability. One minor subjective gripe i have is how slippery the case is. Some micro knurling on the aluminum sides would go a long way to adding grip and still look and feel great."

I work as a tradesman and I have no doubt this case will fully protect my phone from drops or dust etc. The size is what I expected, it doesn't really add too much extra bulk to an already large phone.the sound quality does suffer a little. The phone is completely sealed in the case and the sound ports are blocked off but it doesn't really bother me to much.Accessing the pen is also a bit tricky, if you trim your nails it's going to be a pain to pull the pen out.I'd give the case 4 stars but the wait time brings my review down a star for the overall purchasing experience."

However, the screen is so incredibly scratched I cannot read the phone in bright sunlight at all. I need to shade it with my body, and that's not always possible. I put the phone in my pocket, and my pockets may have dust or crumbs from horse treats (which are basically made out of dry compressed hay), so while it's a constant presence, it's not particularly rough. I noted in my original review that the clarity of the fingerprint sensor circle is noticeably better (distractingly so) than the clarity of the surrounding screen protector.that continues to be the case. I wish that ghostek could include the same adhesive covering the entire screen to enhance clarity. Finally, the scratches are also protecting the photo lense protector, so my photo quality is not as good. I may be going back to traditional glass protectors and pelican cases, as the scratches plastic will not be workable in the summer sun. Hope they continue to work on improving the design."

There's no raised edge around the screen when the phone is open. It's flush with the edges of the phone screen. You drop it, when open, & it's going to get screen damage. That's not good. The top piece needs to fit right against the cover screen. As it is, there is quite a gap between the cover screen & the case. That isn't good. You don't want dust & all sorts of other things getting in there & gunking up the screen & the case. I paid good money for this case, & it took forever to get it to Texas from Brooklyn. Y'all need to DUMP DHL as your shipper. Go with UPS or USPS. I've only had the case for 9 days, & I'm beginning to wish I had gotten the Otterbox Defender."

          "Contenu": "Product was nicely packaged, good video showing how to attach it to phone. Product itself is a little more bulky then expected but seems like it will be fairly protective. It slips out of your hand more then I thought it would. It does have some silicone grip but very little and no sling or ring to put your finger through like some of the competition. I find that very disappointing. The hinged protects the phone but is larger then I thought and gets in the way when opening the phone and setting it on the table such that it rocks or falls over when interacting with the phone. The case looks nice and I'm sure I will appreciate its protection however the cost was very high compared to other brands. I also bought the attachable ring so that I can hold on the phone better but it was difficult to attach the phone. I attached it to the front because I still wanted to use the magnetic charging but there was less space on the front of the phone to put it which makes holding a little more awkward but still better then without. If someone asked me if I would recommend the case I would tell them to try something cheaper first"

I'm firmly of the opinion they ought to have been able to do something for me at that point.At any rate, yes, the neighbour did hold on to the case, and I was able to pick it up from them (because it so happens that the incorrect address was nearby).The case itself, thus far, feels splendid. It seals the phone seamlessly into military-grade shock-dissipating material; it covers/protects the camera bar (not all Pixel 7 Pro cases do that), as well as the screen (no more fumbling to install those screen protectors requiring surgical dexterity and precision); and the lanyard provides an extra level of security against dropping the phone off a cliff, into a river/lake/ocean, down a sewer grate, etc...) And it does all this without adding excessive bulk. The phone still looks sleek and svelt, it does not look like a tank attachment."

I my opinion the first back piece in pink was not made correctly and this is your way of addressing the problem without actually admitting that the first back piece was wrong.If you\u2019d have let me return the pink I would have bought a whole new black cover and felt better about the whole  process.Your covers are convenient so I\u2019ll probably stick with you.  Thanks for listening.I would like to add that my husband who doesn\u2019t have any medical issues could not remove a card from the new pink back cover; we feel it is not made correctly.

The only complaint I have is there\u2019s no was to hear the person you\u2019re speaking to through the case unless you put the call on speaker and remove the charging port cover. The iPhones have stereo sound and the case blocks the ear piece speaker so you can\u2019t hear music or regular phone conversations clear, they sound muffled. The other complaint is the rear camera. When you zoom out to 0.5, the case shows a \u201cfish eye lens\u201d to the picture unwanted. I think the case lifts up from the phone and doesn\u2019t stay in place. Other than that, it\u2019s a better alternative to the other waterproof cases in the market."

It's not me, or how I take care of the cases, its the cases. If all my cases looked bad I'd agree it could be how I'm taking care of them, but it's not me.

          "Contenu": "The advertising for the case and Ghostek in general is very well made. It really hypes the product to a point that it's hard to be fully satisfied. The sound quality, if you need to make a call using the phone is as you would expect with a waterproof case, there no miracle with this case, it sound about the same as it did with other brands. In term of using the case, it is more something that I would use once in an while and not full time. That is solely based on how difficult it is to open the charge port as well as the sound quality when playing a video or talking on the phone. I feel it will be useful whenever I am going kayak fishing or hiking. The case, while it looks super sharp when clean, is a fingerprint magnet. The back and the front of the case get dirty and are fairly difficult to clean compared to other screen protectors. Would I buy it again, I would when it comes on sale, I don't think I would pay full price but I do intent to get another one when I replace my phone. I also feel like the regular, non-waterproof case will probably something I get too. I would love for Ghostek to push toward wireless chargers(Car), mounting options, etc.; adapted to their case like some other companies are doing. It would also be great if they made it to fit with a screen protector, given the case will not be on the phone every day, a solution to that issue would be great. It fits, but the usage is so so. 4 Stars overall, because it's very solid, very nice looking and well advertised."

This is now sorted and I understand that the issue was a combination of misunderstanding and bad luck.

But they never answer back.On the 30th of November I sent a kind reminder.. but no answer.On the 7th of December I sent another reminder.. but again no answer.On the 8th of December, I go package hunting at 2 of my local post offices and I was able to find the package which changed delivery method mid-journey and was handled by the local post office service now.Anyway, at this point I am happy because even after 1 month I got my package but instead of an iphone 15 case I was sent some kind of a foldable case.So now I ve sent my 5th email requesting a full return and refund + the additional costs of local VAT and import taxes I incurred with little faith that I will ever receive an answer.Ghostek seems to be living up to its name, ghosting customers.I just hope someone from the company sees this and gets in touch. I have no interest in your products anymore and I just want my money back."

I bought the atomic slim 4 case for my Samsung galaxy z fold 5 and found 2 over looked issues that other high end companies have addressed. First, the back hinge protector is big and the space it has should have been utilized for storage and protection of the s pen. That would have been a great way to give more purpose to each part of the phone case and the z fold's well known accessory. Secondly the space for the finger print button access on the side is too narrow and greatly hinders using that function for quick access into a locked phone. Improvements are needed regarding both points. Otherwise the case is truly well designed and of fantastic quality!! 8 out of 10 rating. Great company with innovative designs!"

If possible the buttons could be more low profile. The back of the phone case would be much better if it was a \u201cone-piece\u201d solid plastic design using the same material as the surround rather than the gloss black insert that is prone to scratches (it\u2019s just an unnecessary extra seam that can fail). The MagSafe insignia on the back is ugly, find a way to integrate the MagSafe technology with the Ghostek symbol or hide it completely (make the symbol gloss black against the black satin/matte case). It would make a much more sleek design. The Lifeproof Fre charging port cover/seal is a better design; easier to use and better looking. I hope this case can handle water just as well. I am so glad this case uses a harder plastic rather than the rubbery surround from the lifeproof fre because it wears quickly and loses its adhesion which causes it to basically fall apart. My favorite part about this case is the price point. It is so much more appropriate than other brands. I will buy three of these cases before I buy one rip-off lifeproof or otter box case!"

My most recent case for the S23 ultra provides excellent protection but ov erall is a bit heavy.  I purchased the wallet version with the wallet attaching magnetically...it holds to the main case with  just the right force to keep it firmly in place. Furthermore, when I need to remove it for, say, charging on my charging pad, it removes without excessive force...an amazing balance between the two design conditions for the wallet.  However, I am a bit disappointed in the physical design of the wallet in that it has a magnetic cover over the 3 cards it holds. If the cards are a bit misaligned the cover will not close forcing a pause to move them around into position so it can engage the magetic closure mechanism.  The cover can be used to put the phone in stand mode which is a great feature.  Overall, a thoughtfully designed case."

The phone doesn't sit as firmly in the case as it's designed to. The shock absorbing inner rubber things push it out slightly causing the case to partially cover the lower speaker and mic. Not enough to effect calls but still noticable. It also means that if I push on the camera bar a little it pops the phone out. Overall I really like it and haven't had any troubles yet"

My only feedback is that I was hoping the case itself would also be magnetic as well or instead of the wallet because as I had expected, while using the wallet case on my magnetic car mount it had been occasionally falling off. I think this is due to the case being a little chunkier (especially with the wallet) and it having to magnetize through the outer plastic material. So I will likely have to purchase an additional stronger magnetic car mount to hold it."

Numerous drops, wet weather you name it my Galaxy S8, which I just retired after 8 years of use on farms, hiking & fairly rugged use, still looks brand new. My new phone S23+ arrived so I got a waterproof/shockproof case for it. Turned out the front screen of the case had a defect. Ghostek was AWESOME at getting this resolved and I got new replacement case in just a few days, but in the meantime, my new phone slid off the sofa onto the floor... about a 1.5 foot drop. I didn't think anything of it based on my previous experience with these cases but when the new case arrived and I transferred the phone to the new case, I notice the top of my brand new, week-old phone was cracked on the top edge. While I think this new case will offer good protection, I'm pretty disappointed bc supposedly using this case you can drop your phone from a much greater height without damage to the phone. I did notice this case doesn't have the 'rubber' edging that my last case had so maybe that's why?"

          "Contenu": "I've had it for almost two weeks now, I love my Prismatic Ghostek case.The case is of good quality and is well made. I feel my phone is protected.I gave it 4 stars (a high praise from me, as I am very critical of phone cases) for a few reasons. The clear plastic back is quite slippery, especially after holding your phone for an extended amount of time. I found my hand would get sweaty and if I were holding the phone sideways for game playing or streaming, and I'd lose my grip on the phone. I ended up buying a Mobi Handle to fix that problem. I like quality products. I am not a rich person, but I also can't justify putting a $1400 phone in a cheap $10 case (hence me choosing to buy this case, after reading many reviews and watching product videos.)The only other issue I have is with the grips on the sides of the phone.There is a hard edge to them that makes them uncomfortable to hold.I wish the grip part was a softer material. I am a woman, I have small hands and need to hold the phone (an S23 Ultra, a big phone) with a tighter grip.This issue probably won't bother people with larger hands.All in all, I am very happy with my purchase. I even bought my mom one in Purple. She loves it as well.I hope the prismatic colors hold up and it lasts for a few years."

Had the case for about a month and there's still no dirt, water/moisture underneath the protective screens so it does it's job well. The only 2 cons that I've noticed is the speakers are very muffled (which is for water protection) so having a phone call in a loud environment is a no-go. And the finger print scanner part worked well for a few days but the left side has formed a small air bubble so the scanner is no longer reading my finger print. Other than those 2 cons, it's a solid phone case."

The website is well laid out so it's easy to find what products you're looking for and what model of phone you need to match. They even had products that I never even knew about and I ended up buying more than just their cases. The sale! Omg the sale was fantastic and I even got a discount code that made it even better! My Note 20 Ultra is now covertly covered, charged & gripped! I enjoy the little videos they have on YouTube calling their customers agents. It adds personality to the brand and I'm there for it. Ghostek cases are practically indestructible. The nautical cases are slim but completely waterproof and tough as nails. The Nrgy charging cable is the most flexible material reinforced cord I've ever had and I absolutely love it. It allows my quick charge blocks to reach my phone & charges super fast.  The hoster fits all the cases I got and adds a clip & a stand to the ones that need it. I'm very happy with my purchases and I'd recommend this company to anyone who likes a little whimsy & rock solid protection with their phone gear. Good luck, Agent!"

The ease of ordering on their website made the process hassle-free, and the timely shipping ensured I received the product at my doorstep promptly.One of the standout features is how well the case fits my phone; it's like a second skin. The minimal impact on the phone's thickness is commendable, providing a sleek and comfortable feel without compromising on protection. The case offers a perfect balance between a slim design and robust defense.The waterproof nature of the case has proven to be a game-changer. On more than one occasion, it has safeguarded my phone from unexpected encounters with water. The added layer of protection is a reassuring feature, especially for those who lead an active lifestyle or find themselves in unpredictable weather conditions.This isn't my first Google Pixel 7 Series case, and it certainly won't be my last. The durability and reliability of their products are evident. My only reason for purchasing a second case was due to an unfortunate incident that punctured the film over the flash, compromising the waterproofing. However, this incident only reinforced my trust in the product.In conclusion, the Google Pixel 7 Series Rugged Full Body Waterproof Case \u2014 NAUTICAL slim is a great investment for anyone looking for top-notch protection without sacrificing style. I highly recommend it and will continue to choose this series for all my future phone case needs."

Bought my first case for a trip to Niagara Falls, NY and it held up well walking the Cave of the Winds. I got soaked and so did the phone but I managed to get some food photos. My only \"issue\", nit picking here, is that I wish the sides were a little more textured and maybe with some rubber for a little more grip.

The finishes last even after me abusing my old phone for over a year. 2) style: I think these are some of the best looking cases on the market. The Atomic slim is sleek but utilitarian/military inspired, color ways are great and they\u2019ve added more styles/colors since my first. 3) safe: I\u2019m not gentle on phones\u2026I drop mine frequently and toss it around and on the floor at the gym. My phone looked as good as the day I got it when I traded it in. 4) mag safe means mag safe: this case anchors my phone on its charger/mount like nothing else. I never have to worry my phone falling off no matter what I\u2019ve done to it. You truly cannot go wrong with a Ghostek case. Otter who?"

          "Contenu": "Here is an account of my experience with Ghostech. I am holding in my hands right now, one of the best purchase decisions I have ever made. I am holding in my hand two different products. 1.) A two thousand dollar phone: the Samsung Galaxy Z FOLD 5. One of, if not the most sophisticated phones available on the Planet today, including the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max which this phone trumps in my opinion. 2.) The Ghostech product that goes with the Samsung Galaxy Z FOLD 5 ( there are two if I am not mistaken and the more expensive one costs over twice as much as the less expensive one which is expensive. I have the more expensive one, it cost $200.) Concerning the Samsung Galaxy Z FOLD 5: I have not even begun to explore this phone. The features are many. The thing that stands out about it the most is that in the configuration that I have it in at the moment *(folded) it is likely the smallest  Most compact Smart Phone on the Market. We're I to put it in it's only other configuration , unfolded, it would be the the largest Smart Phone on the Market. It's revolutionary. The big deal is that the touch enabled screen folds. There may have been some problems with earlier versions, but these have been eliminated with the Advent of the FOLD 5. Concerning the Ghostech case:Simply put, it's a miracle. The list of advanced materials puts the Starship Enterprise to shame. The engineering of this, the mechanical engineering stands as a testament to the advantages of the modern day Computer Modeling and AI enhanced Machibe Learning available to our top minds today. And that is who I give credit to, the Human Engineers who conceived, designed, and executed the prototypes and then everything else they did after that. I am holding in my hand the most sophisticated phone case in the worldl which my personal assistant assembled in about 90 seconds. GHOSTECH hit this one out of the park. Way to go, guys."
