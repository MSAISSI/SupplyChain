That was $35 for the service call. Previously, it was over $100 to get things restored.. Be careful what you download. It asked if I wanted to install the update. Of course, that's why I got the program. Maybe it did not completely or correctly install the update? Whatever the reasons, I uninstalled the DriverEasy program today and will not recommend it."

          "Contenu": "I was researching how to fix a printing problem online and I took a gamble with this company/business, which was a \"sponsored ad\" at the top of the Google results. Immediately upon downloading my computer was acting boggy and glitchy. I was prompted to download the file repeatedly for roughly 5 minutes and finally I lucked out with a working file. After the program scanned my computer (very quickly might I add, I was impressed.) I was subsequently asked to download over SIXTY drivers. Now I know I am a little behind when it comes to technology, so I must assume part responsibility for operator error, but the program was basically harassing me and the trickery aspect of their marketing was obviously apparent. Needless to say, I reluctantly entered my payment information with a sense of calamity through their posted \"money back guarantee\". Once I realized I had been had, it was too late because even though I received a very prompt and punctual automated response to my refund request with a ticket number, I have yet to be followed up with by any company personnel... over a week later, still nothing. Keep your money and save your time. This appears to be nothing more than an intentionally confusing click-bait scam."

          "Contenu": "Driver easy is super crap. I done a amazing fresh install of Windows and it was running fine. But I didn't have the drivers to access my data drive that was connected on the scu sata port on my motherboard and the driver to be able to use an xbox controller on my PC. So I installed Driver Easy and then proceeded to update all my drivers; as although I didn't need them, I thought it would lead to greater performance and benefits. To my dismay, this application's automatic Driver updates caused my PC to become superslow and caused an error with the in built graphics card on the motherboard. The paid service which is designed to improve PC experience done the exact opposite.To add even more insult to injury, the driver easy program failed to create a system restore point before updating the drivers, thus making it very difficult to rollback the negative changes.I was able, by the grace of God, to reverse some of the damages caused by this program by downloading drivers from my motherboard's manufacturer website. But still, my PC is not as fast as it was compared to before it was attacked by DriverEasy!All in all, from my experience I recommend to absolutely avoid this malicious program as it seeks to destroy PCs and not improve them!"

I asked for the system to crate a backup. Went through on system 1 but there must be a HD issue as the Disk 0 is maxed at 100%. So I figured, I bought this so lets use this on my daily system which is working fine. Created a back up point. Updated 23 drivers but now I have system bugs. My dual monitors go black when I am presenting in Teams and Zoom. They go black when I go to websites. Absolutely ridiculous. Support is not helping very much. Also the system did not create a back up point in my drivers so now I am asking the support to tell me what is friggin WRONG WITH MY COMPUTER THAT WAS WORKING FINE BEFORE!!!!! I hope they fix this cause I'm kind of a little &^%$$#$%%# mad about this right now.... as you can tell."

(I have already submitted this information earlier through your website.Description:My problem started 6 months ago when my computer's motherboard failed.  My computer is a HP-Pavilion 27\" Touch Screen All in One - Intel Corei7   12GB Memory - 256B Solid State Drive.  Anyway, when my computer was returned from Best Buy's \"Computer Center\", with a new motherboard, my audio would not work despite the fact the built-in speakers were connected.  Somehow the computer was not recognizing that the speakers were in place ... When one right hand clicked on the Speaker Icon the drop down showed the \u201cSpeaker Set -Up (Unknown) - OFF\".  Well, long story short ... the store, itself, did \"something\" and got the speakers to work again but the manager told me a future Windows update might disable the speakers again.  Well, yesterday I had two Window 10 updates which did nothing to my speakers, but my Windows Search feature became disabled (which has happened before) so I tried my usual fixes, and nothing happened.  So, then I backed out the updates and still nothing happened.  It was then I downloaded Media Creation Tool I22H2 (which was advertised to fix this issue) and did fix my Window Search problem but somehow now has disabled my speakers!  I then searched the internet for how to fix the speaker problem and came to Driver Easy which I purchased and updated my drivers which has not solved my issue.Sorry for such a winded story but I want to give you all the details.  Sincerely,Thomas Diemer"

But NOT on my EliteBook. So I did a web search and found this website. https://www drivereasy com/knowledge/solved-windows-10-bluetooth-audio-stuttering-issues/I went through each and every Fix on this page to resolve the issue.I paid for the Driver program in Fix 4. and went through Fix 5 to no avail.So, I went to Fix number 6 and installed \"Fortech\" which took care of some other small issues. But did not clear up the Bluetooth Audio Stuttering Issues.So, I am now at a loss of what to do. If this cannot be resolved, I would like a refund.Thank you for your assistance.Dan Gordon"

Very frustrating to be stuck with a freshly reset PC and no way to access the update driver functions I rightfully paid for. Oh, and the \"login\" to reset device associations direction is a dead end because i was never asked to CREATE a login for Drivereasy as far as i remember (and if I did then your reset password function is broken and not sending out reset links).  This COULD be a great program, COULD be a must-have for any PC, but some of your oporations still need work obviously.  Two days lag before you can expect a customer service reply?"

This monitor is critical to my work. New 3D monitors are not available and used ones are very hard to find.I have not been able to roll back the driver update and I have not been able to do a manual update.A system backup was done before the update, but the system restore failed.I submitted a ticket almost a week ago and have followed up with reminders, but I have not been contacted by support.Driver Easy may not be responsible for the failure of the new driver, but they should be responsible for recovering the original driver and full functionality of the monitor."

Rather than open up my machine to try and find out what the graphics chip was, I just ran Driver Easy and it immediately identified the missing driver and the ones that needed updating. I wasn't prepared to wait the 5 hours for the driver to download using the FREE version of Driver Easy so I bought the subscription (which isn't bad for a year). It download/installed and my monitor worked straight after the reboot. Well worth it to save some time, though I may only use it the once, so you will have to factor in whether it is worth it to you."

Perhaps its existence on my device should have been made a bit more transparent to me by the company!PostscriptA few days after writing this review I discovered an e-mail that would have alerted me to the presence of Driver Easy on my laptop in the junk folder. I can't remember whether I was alerted to that possibility by the company.Anyway, so far so good with the product!"

I don't have a great idea as to why, but it might also just be my pc.However, usually these sort of problems arent the case.Last year when I had pro, I had no faults after updating the drivers.It only appears to be this time around.4/5 its worth it, but be careful when dealing with drivers in general."

For a single PC (which is likely the most common subscription option), you'll pay only 30 dollars for a year's subscription (which is less than 3 dollars a month, if you can't be bothered to do the math), and the product is also quite easy to activate after the subscription is purchased.Also, the product not only does its job, but does it well. When I find my PC isn't running as fast as it should be, or the speakers aren't blasting as loud as I'm used to, all I gotta do is let Driver Easy do it's thing, and boom! Problem solved!So yes, I HIGHLY recommend Driver Easy to keep your computer running smoothly, and at an affordable price!"

So I downloaded Driver Easy and it was that easy. Just a click to scan and another to download. And everything works. I just wish there was a life-time licence. For 1 year for 30 bucks, and I will probably use it once. I never had to install or update drivers. Maybe that is a wrong thing to do, but I never had problems not updating during the lifespan of a computer. Unless I had to reinstall Windows. But otherwise great investment to a perfect program."

Finally at the end it said download this free version and you may need the pro version.  Let me just say the $30 for the pro version I spent was WORTH my sanity. It found 18 missing drivers and knew my computer specs automatically so I didn't have to search what Dell version I had. Voila, my wifi was accessible again and seemed to get things working a little more speedily.  Thank you to Driver Easy! I'd definitely recommend."

Well I decided I would purchase the program so It could update the 10 drivers that needed updating and i was pleasantly surprised at how quickly and efficiently it did just that. It even fixed an issue i had with a game I have on my computer that wasn't booting up that just started unexpectedly. I can safely vouch that Driver Easy is Easy."

          "Contenu": "I built a very high end desktop system early this year. I built it with best components I could afford. It's maxed out on memory and has one of the fastest Intel 13th gen CPUs available.When it runs it was wicked fast and made CPU/GPU intensive jobs a breeze. But after a recent Windows update it became more and more unstable. If it went to sleep it would not wake up except by rebooting. Often it would just reboot for no reason. My dream system was useless. It became a huge frustrating time suck. I spent days searching for advice on how to address the severe errors in the event log. While searching for information on Windows driver issues I came upon Driver Easy. I figured I'd try Driver Easy before spending days to reinstall Windows, all the hardware drivers and all the applications I use. I downloaded the trial version (this is a GREAT idea) and Driver Easy found a very large number of possible driver issues. I used the manual method to find and repair a couple of the more serious driver issues. Driver Easy found many issues that the motherboard's manufacturer (ASUS) or the other major components (e.g. MSI 4070 GPU) or Windows update did not address.After using the Driver Easy trial version my system had fewer problems booting (yes, I had booting issues too). The improvement in stability was dramatic and I decided to purchase a license in order to get the \"automatic\" fix procedure to address the rest of the problems it found.Driver Easy is the real deal and absolutely lives up to its advertising. I let it automatically repair a large number of suggested driver issues. My system is now rock solid and stable. Before Driver Easy, my system would reboot several times a day and even rebooting took several tries. Driver Easy saved me *days* of work to reinstall Windows, all the hardware drivers and dozens of applications. Thank you for a great product! I'd give it more stars if I could...:-)"
