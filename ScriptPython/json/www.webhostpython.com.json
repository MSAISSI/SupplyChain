          "Contenu": "Was referred by a trusted friend. But my experience so far has been very different.Right off the bat these guys have been extremely lazy. The first thing I noticed is that their \"24/7 live support\" does not actually exist. It's all a ticket system, yet they still advertise live chat support.Prior to requesting migration, I spend 8 hours configuring my websites to make it easy on them and even asked them for the best practices and offered to migrate the sites myself, since I insisted they be done one by one (for many, many reasons).Instead, they just migrated my entire hosting account in one shot, which is exactly what I did not want (for many, many reasons) and then they tell me \"yeah, just delete anything you don't want\".Definitely regretting this so far. They refunded. Moving on."

          "Contenu": "Their hosting packages are cheap and include lots of features, so it looks good up front.  Unfortunately, their customer support personnel seem either inept or unwilling to help customers with bigger issues.  I've used 3 different webhosts before WebHostPython, and I have had 10x MORE support tickets in to fix things.  Now, they're just placing support tickets on hold without answering them, on top of not answering their phones.  It's like their customer support all just vanished.  I've tried calling every day for over 7 days.  I've had tickets waiting over a week, and they're simply placed on hold without responses.  Even after I update the ticket to keep it open, they simply place them on hold again, still without a single word in reply.  I would avoid this webhost."

Then when I asked them, they said it was because my sites were on a shared plan. I moved to a VPS and was paying $40 still the same thing happened. I don\u2019t trust their security.  And I think they hack their customers site on purpose.  Another time I transferred my site to an upgraded plan, one of the employer (the customer rep that did the upgrade  and transfer) added his affiliate site to my account. When I complained, the removed the site and made up bunch of excuses to cover up the fraud. Also the owner of the company James is very arrogant whenever he response to tickets. If you use them be warned your site will be offline most times and they will keep recommending you upgrade to a higher plan. They lack credibility and transparency."

Never experience downtime and my websites speed is always incredible. Big shout out to James and the rest of the team. They've always gone above and beyond whenever I'm needing help and I greatly appreciate all they've done for me. If I could rate 10 stars I would and I'm sorry I took so long to leave this.
