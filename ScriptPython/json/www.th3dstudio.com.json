          "Contenu": "Wanted to upgrade the company's farm so we purchased the tough extruder and hot-end from TH3D. And we lost about a month on one printer trying to diagnose it. But, they refused a return because the products were not in like-new condition with bad/miss comprehension. FYI: the extruder and hot-end they sell are clones of E3D and the extruder, we purchased, is defective. We found this out by replacing the main support cover and the extruder's pinion gear, which made it work perfectly. Sadly during the return the debating was very unprofessional and we received childish remarks from the owner (about my knowledge) which caused my team and I to no longer rely, buy, or recommend their products. If you have great success with them, then by means, continue. But as for us, we will not be doing anymore business with this company. I wouldn't be surprised if they tried to justify themselves by responding to this review. They have blocked my company from their site because we wanted to leave a caution but since they administrate their own site, our cautions would just be deleted. So we deiced on this domain for a fair hearing."

          "Titre": "Nice item but costly hidden snag...",
          "Contenu": "Came to this site for a accessory purchased for my 3D printer due to the great reviews etc.  What I didn\u2019t count on was a small but costly snag.When going through the checkout I was presented with different postage costs and because I was in no hurry for it I picked the cheapest.  What I never counted for was the hidden cost that the seemed to hide in their terms and conditions which other sites do not.  It\u2019s the customs charging that some sites actually inform you if they don\u2019t pay.  Some sites unlike these actually include the custom charges.Th3d actually admitted in an email to me that they have it stated in their terms that all buyers are responsible for any customs charges that their own country impose on items that are delivered with their own country, which I understand but this was never pointed out within the checkout like other sites do to help their buyers.  If I had known there was going to be an extra customs charge I would never have purchased from them.How many people actually read the terms of a site for hidden charges that maybe imposed?  It\u2019s normally within the checkouts that most companies state \u2018please note when ordering outside of out Country, you are responsible for any customs and handling charges that maybe imposed on your item\u2019 or even add the charges on to cover any customs charges that maybe imposed.It\u2019s not very hard for a company to find out what countries charge what for different valued items.  I did suggest to \u2018Tor\u2019 who has been replying to me that it would be better to have that warning in the checkout, but he refused stating its other countries that impose the charges.  It seems that suggestion went over their head or else \u2018Tor\u2019 is virtually stating we have it running how we like and we're not going to change it.  If you don\u2019t read the terms of all sites that\u2019s your problem.So readers please be very aware of any hidden charges within ALL sites terms, you may even have to be a lawyer to figure them out in the future.Edit (8th Feb 2021):In reply to the feedback left from Th3d, it\u2019s funny how other companies including those from USA can and do calculate customs fees with customs calculators that are freely available on the internet, they also pass the fees onto their customers during checkout.I am only leaving feedback for your company as you seemed to of failed to grasp the information that has been provided to you, at least you could place a warning stating \u2018If you\u2019re from outside USA, you maybe hit by customs import duty which we do NOT pay for\u2019.02/12/2021Reply:  not everyone reads the \u2018small print\u2019, I guess you guys do when ever you\u2019re ordering something from a site?Yes I have noticed you\u2019re no longer going to ship to the uk due to our government introducing VAT to companies who sell and ship into the UK.  But I also see you still want our business by asking if any company wants to sell your products over here to get in touch, guess you just want to sell the items without paying our vat lol.Happy printing yourselves."

          "Contenu": "So I joined here namely to thank the firmware developers of TH3D. I have an original ender 3 which I have upgraded heavily. Well a couple weeks ago I finally decided to upgrade the board with a BTT skr mini 3.0, and what a nightmare it was I couldn't get it to do a thing with the stock firmware. After 2 weeks of pulling my hair out I came across TH3D unified and figured if $5 has a chance of solving the issue it's worth it. Well best darn $5 ever!!! I've never compiled firmware and never used visual studio and with the short TH3D videos and instructions in the firmware I was up and running in under and hour and this thing is like a whole new printer absolutely amazing. Thank you guys so much you rock!!!"

Once my Ender 3 started having print quality issues due to the bed not being level and the BL-Touch not being able to compensate for such drastic leveling issues, I swapped out the stock springs for the solid bed mounts and instantly fixed my leveling issue.I am using the TH3D Unified firmware on both my CR-10 and Ender 3 as well and that was a good choice as well. Super easy to configure, gives more options for baby stepping and bed probing for the BL-Touch."

I am very satisfied with how helpful they have been thus far. I will certainly be returning to them for additional 3d printing products.Cheers!________________________________________________I followed all of the steps on the TH3D website to upload the firmware to my CR10 V3 w/ BLTouch. After uploading to my printer it does not want to Level the bed, and keeps giving me Endstop Z errors whether the endstop is plugged in or not. Then the extruder just backs the filament out at an extremely high rate. I went over the coding multiple times, quadruple checked it, used multiple slicers, modified the G.code to what your website suggested, went through several videos on your website on what I am missing. To no avail, I've decided to reupload the previous firmware from Creality with BLTouch. It's been working great but it doesn't have several features that I desire, such as Thermal Runaway protection. I am disappointed and I tried everything I could to get it to work, but I'm left wanting to throw my printer across the room. I really, really want this to work. I'll be satisfied if it is verified to work with a CR10 V3, and that I am just an idiot. I'll try tweaking with it again in a month or two."

If you have a problem with an order they will always work with the customer to make things right. As with any business, there can be the occasional customer that has unrealistic expectations and can't be pleased (no matter what) but that is the unfortunate reality for any business.

Bought an EZABL mini, and I thought it was the best thing ever. I still think it great but your EZ Flex 2 system is the new BEST THING EVER. I hadn\u2019t had a single successful print on my CR-10 S5 since I bought it. Nothing would stick to it, it tried everything I could use to get prints to stick, short of concrete or welding. I\u2019ve just taken my full size, one piece, R2D2 dome off the EZ Flex 2 on the printer. No glue, no hairspray just a naked EZ-Flex2. I\u2019m about to order a bunch more for all my printers. Only complaint about the EXFlex is, it almost cost me my left  nipple. Strong magnet, large surface for magnet to snap down very quickly and firmly and sitting too close to the bed as I was doing it. I\u2019m sure you can picture what happened. (You can\u2019t make stuff like that up)\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude37\ud83d\ude37\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83d\ude80LOVE you guys."
