          "Contenu": "They would not honor the offer they quoted on their website.  They said that due to the screen being broken they could not repair the item even though the examples they give for a \"broken\" item on their website lists \"smashed screen\" as the first example of what a broken item could be.  This is false advertising at best, fraud at worst.  Do not waste your time sending anything to them unless it is in pristine condition at which point you'd be better off selling on eBay.Update:  In response to WCT's reply, I want to clarify that the apple watch worked fine, the only issue was the corner of the screen was cracked.  If they couldn't get it to turn on, then it just wasn't charged because the device was 100% functional."

But according to their own description of conditions, minor scratches are considered \"good\" (\"fair\" would be excessive scratches, which my device did not have). They changed the price they had offered for my device. I did complain about this discrepancy in definition and they offered a bit more, but not as much as what they had originally offered. I didn't want the device sent back to me because the whole point of recycling my device is to help the environment, shipping items back and forth would defeat the whole purpose."

          "Contenu": "Horrible does not even begin to describe the customer service that this company provides. I\u2019ve used these services twice. First problem, no problem. Second problem was hung up on twice after asking for a manager about conflicting emails sent buy them. Bad out weighs the good, unfortunately that the way the world is.  I did eventually receive a call from a supervisor named Anna who was nothing but great after submitting a message via their website and also sending an email to the general company email.  That was very surprising, as most things like that go unanswered.  ***UPDATE 03/09/2023: received another call from Anna after writing my initial review to discuss our previous conversation and to see if she could help resolve any further issues.  I GREATLY appreciate her for doing that, taking her time yet again to try and make things right.  That's rare today!  She also gave me her direct number for any further communication and ask that I please give them another try if possible in the future.  To clear things up, I was in no way seeking anything out of this complaint or gain in any way, not did I receive anything.  I simply wanted them to be aware of the customer service that was being provided to initial calls made to the company.  Anna informed me that they are working to improve on their customer services and the issue with the partially person has been discussed.  Anna, thank you again for your consideration and care in providing a better customer experience, I hope that your business continues to grow and experience great success.  Stars improved to a 3 due to this, FYI I never leave a 5 because if we have reached the top we have no where else to go or improve on and that is when mistakes such as bad customer service begin.Thanks!"

They said the website was making incorrect offers and was offering 50% less values to affected customers.While I initially did not receive the locked in price, after seeing an initial poor review the company did decide to honor the price and other than that issue the process was good. They've told me they've fixed the website issues and the prices are now honored for 21 days from generation, so hopefully everyone else is able to receive those prices upon validation of condition. Thank you WeCellTrade for honoring the original prices and thank you TrustPilot for helping to make sure companies follow best business practices."
