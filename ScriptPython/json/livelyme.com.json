But now if you want to transfer funds for investing you either need to have $3000 sitting in your HSA Lively account making them investment returns while you get nothing or pay $24 per year! Sorry will be finding a new HSA."

          "Contenu": "Applied for transfer of HSA from another company on 9/22/2023. Was informed it would take until 11/5/2023 to complete transaction. Called Lively on 11/13/2023, to learn that their security group decided not to make the transfer and closed my account. I asked why they made this decision, thinking perhaps the next step would be to submit a HSA statement or provide my passport.  They would not give me any reason for their decision and said the next step for me is to find another HSA provider. I asked to speak with a security representative or a manager. They said I cannot speak with security and the manager would call me within a day, but that never happened. They didn't even bother to notify me of their decision. I should have known something was up when I couldn\u2019t log into my account a couple days after the application was submitted. This was the worst customer service experience ever encountered."

          "Contenu": "I would not recommend Lively HSA.  I opened an account 7 weeks ago, or so I thought, incurred medical expenses, and it turns out the account was never opened.  I have a username and password, they\u2019ve sent me a newsletter, but my account was still not open as they were \u201cverifying my identity\u201d.  I just found this out, AFTER I incurred several thousand dollars\u2019 worth of medical expenses for a planned procedure.  I could have rectified whatever the problem was or gone with another company BEFORE the medical expenses, but Lively never contacted me to let me know there was a problem with verifying my identity.  When I finally reached a \u201cmanager\u201d this week, she repeated the same phrase over and over: \u201cAs a company, we are not able to proceed with opening an account.\u201d  She said this was due to a review by the security team, but could not give further details. She only said, \u201cWe were not able to pass the information through to open an account.\u201d  What does that even mean? I have an excellent credit score (not that I was applying for credit so why would that even matter?) and I have the right kind of health insurance for an HSA.  So I can only assume they looked at my name/ gender and decided they didn\u2019t like it?  I mean, what else is their decision based on?  The whole thing was very weird, because when I asked for a reason, the \u201cmanager\u201d just kept repeating the above statements \u2013 I don\u2019t even know what the big deal is- ok, you don\u2019t want my money.  Fine, but 1) please inform me immediately, instead of waiting until I call almost two months later and discover there is a problem and 2) why repeat these weird answers like a robot; what are you hiding?All very strange.  In the end I\u2019m happy that I am not with Lively. I went to Fidelity and opened a new HSA and it took me about 5 minutes.  And Fidelity has many more investment options, so I guess Lively\u2019s weirdness was a blessing in disguise!"

Terrible and annoying fees, no useful help.Reply to Lively from 07/24/2023: I already tried that, geniuses. You notified us of the fee structure change but your competitors offer better options. I cannot liquidate the assets due to government sanctions which means I cannot transfer out, neither Lively nor Charles Schwab wants to waive their fees and has been entirely useless for guidance despite it being out of my control, so I have to leave $3000 uninvested to avoid the fee. I will be leaving these groups as soon as I\u2019m able to liquidate the measly amount in assets that I\u2019m not allowed to liquidate since you\u2019ve been no help whatsoever."

          "Contenu": "Pro - customer service is usually pretty quick to respond, personable, and attentive to details.Cons - they take FOREVER to actually put your money to work.  They typically take 7-10 days to put your money to work in your investment account after you transfer it to them.  I think this is how they make their money - they hold YOUR money and make interest on the float period of a week+ while they sit on your money, and claim that it takes that long to transfer it to your investment account, which is obviously nonsense.  If I issue a transfer request from my bank to my broker, it takes place same day.  But if I issue a transfer request to Lively, to invest in my broker HSA, it takes 7-10 days.  Completely unacceptable.  On top of this, if you're with TDA and being forced to convert to Schwab, they are now going to start charging an annual $24 fee or monthly $3K minimum balance of dead cash for those of us who wish to invest our money, rather than letting you invest ALL of your money, yet they still advertise they charge $0.  That's not truthful advertising since you'll either pay them $2/month, or lose the interest on at least $3K of dead money you have to park at Lively and not invest. So as of now, the only *actual* $0 HSA appears to be Fidelity....which is where I'm considering moving my HSA after the forced conversion from TDA to Schwab."

          "Contenu": "Lively was arguably the most unprofessional and vague company I may have ever had the misfortune of communicating with. Not only was I declined the ability to open an HSA account with them, but I was given the vague walk-around by at least 4 separate service techs and one supervisor all stating, \"we cannot provide a reason for the decline, our security team just said no\", not even a halfway decent attempt to provide me with why I was declined coverage. On top of that none of my emails to their customer service department were ever answered. Self-claiming to be one of the best places to open and HSA account, while also being one of the worst places to try and have an adult conversation is mind-boggling to me. I have half a mind to claim discrimination and file a lawsuit based on my interactions with this \"company\". Horribly disappointed by the lack of professionalism and disgusted by the treatment of a potential account holder. If you are looking to open an HSA with Lively look elsewhere. Fidelity has great options for HSAs, HSA Bank is also another quality option, and check with your local banks as all of them will provide you with better customer service than Lively ever could, I guarantee that."

So far, I am very happy with Lively, go with them if you have the option!"

One of the main reasons I picked them was no fees and their offering of brokerage services via TD Ameritrade, where I have many other accounts.  Since Schwab bought out TD Ameritrade and will migrate accounts to them, unfortunately, maintaining a brokerage account would no longer be fee-free.  With this upcoming migration, I've decided to move my HSA account to Fidelity (again, brokerage account, no fees).  Lively helped me with this final migration.  They've been a great company, with helpful staff and clear communications."
