          "Titre": "Horrible hosting. Do not use.",
          "Contenu": "The service overall was mediocre, a joke. I know I will get a response with excuses and what not but ignore it, everything I say here is the utmost truth about this hosting service. In my case I had the web-hosting plan and I had to spend HOURS working on my website just to get it up and running. Their instructions on adding domains was not clear at all and I had to ask their support for the DNS settings. When the site was up and running, it was VERY VERY slow. Loading the page would take ages even when you had previously loaded into it. At some point my website just crashed and when I went to their support I was blamed for my code. My website used HTML, CSS, JS, and NodeJS. I consulted with multiple NodeJS developers and they all said the exact same thing. \"You aren't doing anything wrong, the hosting is bad.\"  I would attempt to fix the issue but the NodeJS part of their panel would just not work no matter what and they would tell me to restart my NodeJS stuff and I literally couldn't as it said my website wasn't there and wouldn't load. They \"fixed\" the issue for maybe around 10 minutes and all the sites crashed again.They don't even own the servers, they are buying some servers that they resell and called the business' BilligerHost. From what it looked like, it's a bunch of teenagers trying to make a quick buck off this hosting company. Anytime I would have an issue they would have to as their hosting provider because they were pretty much always dumbfounded. Sometimes I would just get a straight \"no clue.\" Also, I was randomly messaged by one of their Support Managers on their Discord server. They kept insisting I got this AI Support for $15 USD a month. I made it very clear I didn't want to buy it multiple times and the Support Manager kept going on and on trying to persuade me to buy it. I was on the brink of blocking them.Sometimes I would try to log onto the dashboard or their website and it would straight up have crashed. I would contact their support and I got \"sorry!! our website crashed!!!!\" In the online File Manager for my site sometimes thing would just not work. Files wouldn't move, couldn't download files from it and it would lag the hole page in an attempt to do so, and a ton of errors.As someone who has used a lot of hosting providers, there is better hosting options out there for your website, game servers, etc. They may be cheap, but you get what you pay for. A slow website/game server in the end. This is just mediocre cashgrab."
