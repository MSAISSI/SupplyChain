          "Contenu": "Just discovered this site to buy speakers remplacement for a car. The first chat was with Chuck and the guy was wonderful, gave me great advices and found exactly what i needed. So i ordered. I paid with my US credit card for the order, that i was supposed to receive before christmas, until there, everything is good. BUT things got bad when i wanted to make a shipping to a friend's P.O. Box, as this was a Christmas gift. They absolutely wanted to talk to the owner of the P.O. Box, to make sure that this person was aware that a shipment was made to the this box. They sent me e-mails like a was a scam, they called me, and after discussions, i gave them the phone number of the P.O. Box owner (even if this will the the christmas surprise gift) And they never even contacted her. Saying i had to provide another address for delivery. But in the end, who cares? i already paid for my order, can i decide where i want to ship it? Or even to who i want to ship it? So i asked for a refund and i will buy somewhere else. What started out great, went bad. I still don't understand why. Too bad for this christmas gift. Never again Crutchfield for me, i'm sorry."

I recently purchased a stereo for my vehicle, but unfortunately that vehicle caught fire. The purchase was 3 weeks outside of the return period, but I was hoping they could give me store credit as I would probably purchase items for my new vehicle when purchased. I was told there was nothing that could be done.This showed me that they only care about making money, and not the customers they make their money off of. All items were unopened and sealed.Please beware that once an item has been purchased their level of care for customers is none."

The facts are that it won't. Detail tracking, and Crutchfield's own tracking page, indicates it sat at their dock 4 calendar days AND will not deliver for a full week. So the question posed initially remains. How is it you \"sell\" same day shipping/2 day service to WA state but don't provide it? And then, secondary, respond with false information?Order #52474837. When I placed the order it said \"will ship today if ordered within the next 20 minutes\". I placed the order right then and now 4 days later (Fri-Monday) package only has a shipping label applied at origin - not picked up yet. I usually have no issues with Crutchfield but why tell a customer something that isn't true?"

          "Contenu": "While Crutchfield promotes self-installation as a cost-saving measure, the process falls short for complex setups and lacks the promised level of custom support. Customers should be aware of potential complications and hidden costs before proceeding.Key Concerns:Misleading Information: Crutchfield's \"Custom\" installation instructions are not truly specific to individual car and radio configurations. Additionally, instructions for accessory parts often lack clear guidance and require referencing separate manuals, creating confusion and frustration.Limited Support: Customer support representatives often refer customers back to existing documentation, even when the specific information is unclear or missing. Moreover, support abruptly ends at closing hours, leaving customers without assistance during critical troubleshooting steps.Return Fees: In case of product issues or dissatisfaction, Crutchfield imposes restocking fees, further adding to the financial burden of a failed installation attempt.Complex Installation Nightmare: For complex setups, the self-installation process can become a time-consuming and frustrating ordeal, negating any potential cost savings.Recommendation:For complex installations, engaging with a professional installer at another store offering free or low-cost installation services is strongly recommended. This ensures proper installation, avoids potential headaches, and guarantees accountability for any issues.Overall:While Crutchfield's self-installation option may appeal to technically inclined individuals with simple setups, the lack of truly customized instructions, limited support, and potential restocking fees make it a risky proposition for complex installations. Customers should carefully consider these factors before choosing Crutchfield for their car audio installation needs."

Crutchfield Canada has been slow to recognize something had gone wrong, requiring multiple calls from me. They could not, and as of now, have not confirmed with me if the item was actually shipped out by their warehouse, saying that it would \"be a few days to find out\". The UPS tracking number sat idle for a week after the initial scan on 11th October 2023, changed to 'We've begun an investigation to locate the package' a week later, and now reports 'Investigation ClosedYour investigation has been closed with a proof of delivery.'I have checked with UPS customer support, and they say that their systems show the investigation as ongoing, and not closed. Quite significantly disappointed in Crutchfield Canada and UPS. I do not know if/when the package will be located, had it actually been shipped, I do not know if/when I will receive the item I ordered, nor do I know how long it will take to get a refund should that be the only option. So far, this has been quite terrible.---Nov 6th: UPS has since confirmed the package as missing. Crutchfield re-shipped the item from their USA warehouse as Crutchfield CA had run out of stock. This caused me to incur an additional charge of CAD$70. While I have the item which I ordered, I have to request reimbursement for the additional charge. The receipt for this charge has been forwarded to Crutchfield for reimbursement."

If you buy both at the same time you get a discount on the installation kit that makes it nearly free and you get free shipping. The stereo was nice but the installation kit didn't fit even though I talked to one of their advisers first. I called them and they told me I had to order a different installation kit from them but don't worry they would take care of it. So I ordered another kit, paid for it and the customer rep said he would remove the charge so it would be free. Two days later I noticed I was charged the full amount plus about $30 extra. I phoned and asked another customer rep what was the deal. She says that I had to pay for the new installation kit (I must have heard the other rep wrongly) and I had to pay the shipping to get it. When I heard this I said is it shipped yet, she said yes and then I said I was just going to send everything back. She said yes you can return everything but you have to pay to ship back everything to the United States and there would be a 15% restocking fee on top of that. This whole ordeal was a nightmare and their customer service just straight out lies to you."

          "Contenu": "I ordered a marine audio receiver on a Saturday at Crutchfield, since they offered a 2 day shipping service. I hoped to receive the package on Monday or Tuesday. This since I needed to build in the item on Wednesday.On Monday, on the end of the day I receive an e-mail, stating that they need extra creditcard details, since my billing adres is out of the USA. Which I only noticed Tuesday morning.  After calling with them, providing the information, still nothing. Only after calling again, they told me it was going to take some time to process the payment. To be able to ship the order out the the same day, they requested I made one more payment, but now via PayPal, both debit cards, so no risk to to them. Still nothing. Finally after the 6th call, they tell me, sorry we won't be able to ship the item today, and probably also not tomorrow.So much for guaranteed 2 day delivery, and self proclaimed great customer service... Thank you for waisting my time. Also, I am now charged double, and hope I get my money back..."

I saw the tracking update to within 30 miles from my delivery address around 6AM today. I saw at 1030AM that the status has changed to \"incorrect address\". I called UPS, they told me that I need to call the sender (crutchfield) to have them \"request\" the change of address. I did, then asked how long to take effect. \"24 hours\". hours later, no update. I've called UPS since, they tell me it will be delivered within a day, but that is impossible. the tracking status is the same (address change requested) and tomorrow is new year's eve. Forget it. will go somewhere else for my car audio from now on. suggest others do the same. all because of a simple TYPO and that crutchfield made the horrible decision to use UPS."

I bought a brand new stereo and amp. Installed it, ran up the volume and the amp starting clipping out when I hit higher volumes. The customer service person told me it was the amp within 2 questions. Amazing right? No, this was best guess, the real reason? The P-EQ just needed setup correctly. This was the third phone call I had made with the same conclusions. These folks only know what everyone knows, you can read it on the internet. I would just go somewhere else for customer service. I am tired of taking out and putting in stereos for this company. If you deal with crutch field I guarantee you will be installing your stereo at least 3 times while they experiment with your time. They also will not permit you to post a negative review about their product nor their customer service. I have been waiting weeks for 2 reviews to get posted, no such luck. So of course you are going to look good when you are stacking the deck. So they pick and choose which reviews to post. Maybe it's time for a call to the BBB again. Seems to be the only way to get past the first line of customer service people since they refuse to transfer you to a supervisor. I will also post both of my order numbers just to prove I will never be contacted again! Just watch, I will update and let you know."

          "Contenu": "Warning! Don't use Crutchfield to purchase products with your American express points.  from my experience,  Crutchfield  is not a trusted partner with American Express in comparison so retailers such as Best Buy.  I recently had a horrible experience trying to trade points for my American Express card.  They do not have access to send email confirmation direct to the customer once the product is purchased.  Due to this Crutchfield must manually call to confirm orders prior to shipping.  This process is not clearly advised when purchasing from Critchfield.  If you are hoping on a product to arrive after purchase like I was for a gift for Christmas.  it will not be delivered prior to you accepting a manual phone call, as they will call you from a phone number your phone will consider Spam.  They will only try 1x. They say 2x's.    if you don't answer your call from this spammy phone number.  Your order will canceled and NO notice via email will be sent.  I lost out on a 30% promotion on the product Amex was offering due to Crutchfield's lack or trust relationship with Amex.  Thier customer service was not empathetic at all and was not willing to make efforts to consider the customers loss or unfortunate experience related to this loss.  If fact, I escalated the issue to the highest level of customer service only to learn of a stubborn position to not consider any concession.    Crutchfield online order processing policies are not considerate to the current online norms related to ecommerce.  If you are expecting a product to be delivered and are a new customer trying to order through Crutchfield, save yourself the hassle and shop from another retail outlet that you Trust."

Cruthfield treated me like garbage. Awful tech support and sales. Really complete incompetence! Do NOT buy from this seller! You may have the same experience I did. Also thier shipper, Fed Ex, drove off with the CD player rather then delivering it. Should have delivered on June 13th.

Until I found out from the manufacture that it does not have analog to HDMI conversion. Which happened to be a selling point for me since many new receivers just have HDMI. Now its either return it and upgrade to a unit that cost $500 more or buy a few component to HDMI convertors and make this one work."

It was a total waste of money all I ended up using was the removal tool and the harness and am left with a bunch of instal hardware that is unneeded.

For example, I purchased a pair of ELAC tower speakers from Crutchfield that were described as having 6.5\" woofers, but upon receiving them, it was clear that they were only 5 1/4 inches in diameter. I double checked to make sure I received the correct models, and I did. The speakers' description online was flatly wrong. They still sounded great, but it sucked that I didn't get what I paid for / expected. So I wrote a critical reviewew to post on their website, complete with a picture of a measurement across the front of the speaker to prove my point. But Crutchfield REFUSED to post the picture and heavily edited my review to make it sound like I was just confused about measurements. It was very frustrating and proves that you can't trust them to be honest or rely on their redacted user \"reviews.\""

          "Contenu": "I bought the unit to replace a more expensive broken Kenwood radio.  To be fair, this replacement is 1/4 of the price of the previous one.  I have had that radio for about 6 months.The good: very easy to install (direct replacement including steering controls), the installation kit is well made, large display with decent colors (but missing the one I wanted to fit my car), good spectrum of options (inputs).  Amazing service from Crutchfield adviser during the whole process.The bad (in order): the software freezes quite often and I have to park the car and restart the engine to reset the radio (quite frustrating); sound quality is average at best (compare to my previous one which was really great) with little dynamic (sound like FM radio even with 24 bits stuff) - no, sound adjustment did not solve it; clock display is never right (despite setting the right option); front glass is too much reflective and difficult to read in day time (sun); customization of the display could be much better (compare to my previous model);  Can you have better for about $600, I don't know but I should have paid more.  I do not recommend but if you only have $600 that might be a decent option if you are ready to leave with the cons..."

It's confusing and unclear when it comes to what's actually supported in a given car. The support person did not seem all that interested in helping me, it felt like I was bothering him by calling in to ask questions when I was going through the instructions and finding that they were not clear when it came to support for backup cameras and bluetooth. Even the support person didn't know the answer to whether factory bluetooth would be supported (even though the answer was 'yes' according to the website). And, now, after going through and finally finding that the backup camera in my vehicle is not supported, and realizing that that pretty much negates the whole deal because it's an integral function of the existing system... I have to pay to have all of this shipped back to Crutchfield. It should be made much CLEARER at the point of sale when there are features as important as existing backup cameras that are not supported. At the end of the day, however, if Crutchfield at least had an adapter for the existing camera, my experience would be different, and maybe I wouldn't have had to be connected with lackluster support personnel."

Even after breaking them in, the new kenwoods have no base and ear shattering treble that the on board EQ settings.

As I have also called Netgear, and they told me other people had this issue, that they cannot exceed 45 mbps with 1200.  Their next Model up is the Power Line 2000. After this I called Crutchfield , and asked if the Power Line 2000 is available. I was told that is not an item they have in Stock at this time, but they may be able to special order it. I have not heard anything back. I am going to call Kay back to see what my options are, as I am not satisfied with the Power Line 1200 level of Performance."

Called again the day after that only to be told a replacement had never been ordered! Finally it was worked out and I got a harness that works. But now I have to go return the entire new unit shipped to me. Inconvenient and also seems like poor practice to do all of the extra shipping and bad for the environment.

That was mid December, and here it is Feb 1 and my TV still has not been fixed.  As much as I like Crutchfield, I don't like this hands off approach and the next time I buy a large, expensive item, I'm probably going to going to a local retailer who will work with me to fix the problem.  I spent too much $$ to spend the holidays and winter break with no TV.  Disappointed."

Our contact with this unit was Taylor from the beginning I should of found someone else he just seemed like I was bothering him or just not worth his time, maybe because I was only spending about $900. His emails was always (I forgot) or some reason he just didn't have the correct information on me or my needs I have all 25 emails linked so I could go back and double check our Convo. Well I guess we'll just have to buy on Amazon which I found everything on there for $175.79 lower than crutchfeild. So sad to see such great service fail so bad. The chance of the times I guess."

Also ordered an XM kit, was suppose to have a rebate for it and 3 months free of XM, after reviewing the offer for the free months it\u2019s out of fate by a year, and no information on the rebate.

A lot of the steps either didn't apply and I had to butcher my trim piece to fit the new radio, but the steps I needed were very detailed. I was also recommended to buy several parts I did not need or didn't fit (even though it was \"for my vehicle.\") Overall it's a great product with decent instructions, but you need to know what you're doing so you don't buy something you don't need."

Everything was included that was neededCons: Crutchfields detailed instructions were missing as a result I just went with prior experience.          One face plate did not seem to fit as it would not go between receiver and double din conversion.  This may be because if lack of instruction so radio was improperly mounted.In the past it seemed like whoever wrote the instructions had actually mounted the unit in a vehicle similar to mine and all possible problems were addressedProblems I encountered because of no detailed instructions:  it seemed the unit was not going in so I cut out more than was necessary because the mounting had to be mounted on an angle to be flush with dash. I connected wires color to matching color but thanks to tech support when unit didn't work I needed to match blue/white with blue.  Final trim would not fit so has to remove mounting tabs and enlarge radio size to be flush.  It took me over 8 hours to complete the mount where before with detailed directions I usually did it in a couple of enjoyable hours instead of trying to get things to work.Would I use Crutchfield again?  Definitely but before starting would contact tech support and get detailed instructions."

The usually straight forward install guide was lacking in some areas, and seemed to focus on a single DIN not a double DIN. It would be a good idea to go back and add some material or links on this, especially the back up camera section, which the Boss overview was absolutely useless. I did find a Crutchfield youtube video on wiring and it helped a lot, explaining the Convenience wire and reverse feed, a blurb in your install instructions would have been appreciated. So all is installed, but I will be cautious on the next order, as I have been a customer for a long time and multiple cars over the years, but my daughter is happy and the stereo works and she has Apple Car Play, so all in all, a long install, but a win."

Found out shipping and inspection of unit would be over $300.00 with an additional cost for any repairs.  Was talking to a friend and he suggested to check and see if any hdmi cable was turned off, he was surprised that I wasn't told to check it. I did and that was the problem, just a tap of a button fixed the problem. It seems the life time support only last as long as the warranty. I was about to spend $2500.00 on another reciever. I had bought from Cruthfields before, thinking I would get a bit more support and paid full manufacturer suggested price, but that's not what will happen. I'm lucky I have a friend that knows stereo equipment."

The amount of additional items provided to facilitate installation helped to get the speakers installed in a timely fashion.  Some of the brackets, adapters worked and some did not, but there were enough options to complete it.  The reviews are also beneficial in learning from others experiences with a similar vehicle or application."

Fast shipment with everything nicely packed as promised.  The radio is great.The instructions for the mounting kit itself are for a variety of 1990-2002 Acura & Honda models, specifically noting the \"INST-7800 is a collection of installation instruction booklets\".  In the kit itself, the so-called \"support bracket\" is a joke, though that\u2019s not so clear from the order page.  However, the separately enclosed Crutchfield authored vehicle-specific Master installation booklet picture an image for a superior metal bracket.  I rarely call support, but this time, I did.A live person was online quickly and able to pull up the order from my phone number.  When I noted the inconsistency, the patient, knowledgeable and articulate support professional admitted the metal bracket was no longer part of the kit for this application.  I was disappointed that the mounting kit did not include a provision for the lower storage tray.  It's set up to enable a cool amplifier, but the online description of the kit for my application did not mention this omission/assumption.Thanks to more online research I discovered the support bracket in my case is superfluous, and found a Metra 99-7892 SKU that works as well as the plastic from Crutchfield along with a useful lower tray that is close enough to the stock unit.If the car wasn't so old, I'd grade more harshly, but am trying to offer specific and overall positive feedback.  Crutchfield is a solid place for a variety of quality automotive electronics and support, but at least for an older vehicle, I'll invest in buying the installation bits that are typically included with the electronics before spending the larger sum."

The hardest parts were finding the reverse trigger wire and getting the parking brake wire connected.   The parking brake connector was visible but not accessible, or at least I gave up trying.  The reverse trigger was another story, I thought I found it and I ended up hooking up the reverse to the headlight wire.  It took a bit, but I finally got it working.  The radio has guide lines, so if you don't like the ones the camera provides you can use the radio's guidelines instead (they look nicer than the camera's guidelines)."

I have a JDM import not sold in the states that requires various install parts from different US vehicles.  They helped me add the proper parts in the online chat.  Great online experience."

The first two, an AXR85 and an AXC35, were my first purchases of audio gear from an online retailer. I opted for slow shipping and the items came in a reasonable amount of time. After about 21 days of operation the AXC35 developed a minor, intermittent glitch in that it wouldn't turn on using the power button. I contacted Crutchfield inside the 30 day window and received authorization for an exchange which went very smoothly. That experience made my last purchase of the AXN10 easier to do. I took advantage of the Black Friday price reduction and let them ship it normally, 2 day I believe. It arrived on the third day which was just fine by me. Overall I've had a very positive experience with Crutchfield and I will look to them first when I decide to order more audio gear or accessories."

I needed to apply a Crutchfield bonus credit that I have had for two years to a purchase of Polk speakers. Everything was invoiced correctly, shipped correctly, and arrived on time.  I appreciated the rep's suggestions/insights to confirm what I was buying. Thank you, Crutchfield!"

I bought from Crutchfield because they did all the work and research to know which harnesses would work with my pickup and they were right on."

Finally, I chose free shipping and they shipped the same day. Unbelievably, I got the receiver the next day. This kind of service is rare today. Well done, Crutchfield!"

          "Contenu": "Crutchfield has you covered from beginning to end.  Thought I found a cheaper option on Amazon, and of course it didn\u2019t come ready to install and with no support.  Called Crutchfield and they first walked me through all of my options that would fit my car, ensuring I got all the features I was looking for.Item arrived quickly, which made me very happy.  I opted out of an option where Crutchfield wires all of the harnessing before they send.  When my item arrived, I was admittedly overwhelmed with all of the wires and wiring ahead of me.Called Crutchfield support.  Can\u2019t say enough about these guys.  Very patient and knowledgable.  Stayed on the phone with me through the entire installation, walking me through step by step.Everything works perfectly, wife thinks I am a Rockstar\u2026 Crutchfield and I know the truth but they don\u2019t mind me taking the credit.  Highly recommend!"
