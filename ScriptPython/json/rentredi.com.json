Again this is my third review and I have 30 tenants signed up, but I will no longer add anyone more !!! TODAY I had 2 tenants who had the funds in their accounts, and continue to have,  rentredi never took out the funds and they now removed them from my account as bounced meanwhile they never took it out of the tenant's account, both on the same date,... but at least this time they sent me an email.!!! THIS now brings it to 3 tenants with funds that were not taken out, In addition they now decide that one of my properties which is in my portfolio they need to charge me $12.95 a month when we already paid the full year in March. Can't get anyone on the phone, and only appointment to talk to someone is July 11 at 2 pm. THIS IS HOW THIS MESS OF A CO OPERATES. Looking for a better service, this is a mess"

We are fairly tech savvy users - and in general you can eventually get most of what you need done by contacting the support team and having them take you through the steps.Biggest headline feedback:1)  Please read all of my threads with your support team members.  All of them are very patient teaching me how to use WAY TOO MANY clicks to get done what should be simple/intuitive tasks in the software.2)  This platform is not 'client/renter' centric.  Any of your users are out of business if client's are not well taken care of.  Half of the icons on the left side of the screen should be consolidated under 'Renters'.3)  I use safari, and 1/2 the time I send a lease for signature, the process fails...don't know why4)  Returning a security deposit should be a single click - the current process is NOT intuitive, yet this step is a core process step with every renter5)  For some reason, we have a lot of prospect renters indicate that they want to complete the app - but then don't.  Am wondering (since I have not used your link myself yet) - if the process is not intuitive/burdensome and that reflects poorly on me as the landlord).  Our brand needs to 'easy to use, very clear, intuitive, accurate'.  Your platform needs to align with our brand image.6)  You could dramatically decrease your customer support time demands by more proactively training users on the common tasks used for every single renter7)  The Dashboard was interesting at first - but I believe needs a rehaul.  It lists interesting, but not ACTIONABLE information.  If it was me, I would want to know the following buckets on a dashboard:  1)  What is my occupancy rate for the next 3, 6, 9, 12 months? 2) Who has leases coming due that I need to pulse to extend or renegotiate terms?  3) What is my projected cash flow next 3, 6, 9, 12 months 4) What are the top reasons why 'applicants' are NOT completing the lease application?8)  I come back to every action starts and ends with a renter/client.  Make the functionality for the top 10 tasks that must happen for each client be 'single click' and very intuitive events...I don't like having to spend so much time with your support team (although they are very good) to perform what should be very routine events for the acquisition, setup, management, and closure of clients on the platform."

The back end accounting and money transfers are absolutely awful. They lump sum your payments and expect you to sort out how much came from each property. A convoluted \u201creport\u201d is available if you spend enough time digging through the site. We are now dealing with a nine day hold on funds after requesting that out hold time be reduced to 24 hours. We are currently sitting, accumulating bank fees on mortgages, while RentRedi decides if they want to release our money. When pressed for answers, no one seems to have any. In the end, this is a great platform for one or two properties but if you want to be a serious property manager RentRedi is not for you. They definitely fall into the amateur category in this industry and will remain there until the company drives to get serious about customer service and payment processing."

And it took them over a week to get back to me on my inquiry. My landlord used RentRedi for one month before deciding it was insufficient for basic functionality and has already moved to a new platform. I'm just sorry he ever used it in the first place as it's been a terrible experience. The one pro I will give them is that they have a live chat feature that made it easy to reach out to customer service (even if I wasn't happy with the answers I ultimately got from them).Update: I reached out to the email listed in RentRedi's response 2.5 weeks ago and (shocker) they never replied. Presumably because they know they won't change their answer or do anything to rectify my situation.Responding to RentRedi update: I indicated such in the opening sentence of my outreach 2.5 weeks ago.

The email they send to let u know a tenant paid says about 3 business days but it never comes through on the day they say in the email. In reality it takes at least business 5 days. So The tenant pays on the 5th. And it only hits your account on the 12th but the emails say the 8th. Not reliable. Cash app, and other payments take only 2 business days. So why are these apps able to do it so quickly and they can\u2019t even keep to the information they give you. Disappointed. Now stuck w this for a year. Will not renew bc they are lying about the time it will hit your account. Banks only take 2 days to clear checks. Snail payment is more their style. If you need to pay your bills early in the month look for something else."

New property and new tenant set up is a breeze and there is always support available through the online chat. Love the credit report feature and lease signature feature and recently I started recommending the renter's insurance feature on the app, which my tenants loved to use because it was fast and the rates were actually much better than the traditional insurance companies.The reports feature-it is not working entirely for me. It is a super lengthy process to get to the reports feature and to reconcile the accounts is time consuming in the current set up.  I should clarify: my problem is that rent payments that are received on the same date from multiple properties are lumped in one large deposit when it reaches our bank account. The reports available so far are missing some of the information I need. I have to go to multiple screens to get my info needed. Please design a report that shows the total deposit from multiple properties paid in one day, the tenant's name, property address, transaction date and amount in one screen.  If y'all have the feature developed - please post it on the main screen or publish an article. So far the \"reports\" under \"Rent\" for the last 30 days shows all the deposits for the separate properties, but don't show the detail for the large deposits received from multiple properties if it gets paid the on same date. This is the way I have been preparing my reports to detail rent by property when multiple payments are posting on the same date:I go to \"Settings\", then \"Feature Settings\", then on the Receive Payments tab click \"Modify\" on the \"Accounts\" tab, then I click  \"Reports\" and lastly \"Transaction reports\" , download in Excell and clean up all the transaction ID info on the spreadsheet."

My other favorite part of the app is the management of maintenance requests. My only wish for this app is that it provide an ability to chat with the tenant about their request. Right now it only lets you receive the request, upload a picture or short video, and mark it as complete. I would like a chat feature to document the discussion and keep it all in one place."

The major hiccup has been that my tenants have issues connecting to their banks, even larger banks. This has been the biggest set-back and why we would look at other rental platforms. Some of my tenants have to disconnect, uninstall the app, reinstall, and reconnect every month just to pay rent. I can see this getting tedious as a tenant, which may damage my business down the line. I'd love for this issue to get resolved and we would gladly stick with RentRedi."

          "Titre": "GREAT app, but a few glitches and room for improvement",
          "Contenu": "Using this app has made it easy for me to handle tenant applications, getting leases signed and stored, and collecting rent.  It is easy to set up charges like automatic late fees as well as one-time fees like cleaning fees or pet fees. The maintenance request system is great too since it allows the tenants to upload pictures and video and you can track the progress of the repair (being reviewed, out for bid, etc). For the most part, the app is easy to use for both tenants and landlords. Customer service are quick to respond to chats and they follow up afterwards to make sure the issues were resolved, which I like.  There are a lot of support and instructional videos online that I can direct my tenants to when they have questions.   There are some issues that I wish would be resolved:There are some things that are not very clear for tenants and they ask me for help, and I as a landlord don't see the same view/options as them. For example, I have had tenants want to change bank accounts for auto pay.  I would tell them to click on \"edit autopay\", but the option to change accounts is not there--I don't know how to help them since I don't even see autopay options as a landlord. I have had to set up a \u2018dummy tenant account\u2019 so that I can see what they see and walk them through it.Another issue is that you can't have 2 tenants using the same email address. So, I can't send a lease to two people for signature unless I set them up separately and then I have to always have 2 separate tenant cards associated to the unit. This isn't a huge issue, but is inconvenient.The reports feature, although useful, are not very easy to use--it takes me several tries to get the data I want to download and I usually end up downloading more than I need since I can't filter it correctly in the app and I will just filter out the data that I don't need in Excel.  For example, when I download Tenant Payment History, I should be able to filter out convenience fees since I don't get that money and I don't care about those payments; I want to see rent/late fees/security deposits that were billed and paid.Some new features, like the information about which payments are part of each pending/completed deposit is very help since it was not always clear which payments were part of the deposit.  This was a great improvement, and they continue to add new features to make it an even better tool.I wish it didn't take so long to get payments posted to my bank account.  I have had several tenants make a payment (and they have enough $ in their account on day of payment), but the withdrawal from their account doesn't happen for 3 days, and then it bounces and they have to start the process over again.  Even if it doesn't bounce, the money is drawn from their account 3 days after they make payment, then the deposit is initiated, and then several days later I get the funds.  It takes over a week in most cases to get my rent money.  Tenants are starting to used CashApp and ChimePay to make payments because it is more reliable and is instant.  The payment turn around-time needs to be shortened.  That being said, it is great that the app allows for ACH payments for only $1, or credit card payments if the tenant wants to pay the extra fees.  It also gives me as a landlord the ability to enter payments received outside of the app such as cash, check, money order, etc.Overall this is a great tool for landlords to be able to self-manage multiple rentals rather easily."

Do a better process of vetting your potential tenants.2. Set up auto late fees in several different configurations which makes late fees a known event that happens without negotiations each month.3. Keep track of which units leases are expiring and your overall tracking of all of your units monthly income.Overall, I like that they are continually improving the product to make it even more useful, which shows that they care about their product and customers."
