I had discrimination issues with them in the past and they take things personal and treat customers with disrespect and prejudice. I figure id give them another chance as I have two iphones for sale and I was quoted a price for bot on their site. I paid money to print out these shipping labels and packing slips. They people email me saying, sell them to someone else. That is fraud, discrimination, and disrespectful and terrible business. On top of that, they do not list a reason for it ! They have a lot of hate, anger, and prejudice and do not do business with Klymen and stay far away from them. On top of they, they low ball you with their offers and prey on people."

Our Terms and Conditions clear states that we are not responsible for lost or missing packages, or missing content\u201d They are lying. I contact UPS and was told they were paid for the claim and the claim was closed. They never told me the package arrived and the box was empty. They have NOT communicated with me outside our last recorded phone conversation where Alex was extremely rude. They are scammer and they are lying. This is the response they left with the BBB: \u201cWe clear stated in our Terms and Conditions that we are not responsible for package or content loss. You accepted Terms and Conditions when you placed order.\u201d No mention of them working with UPS on the claim or the box came empty. Please don\u2019t waste your time and risk being scammed the way I did.Update: I didn\u2019t send you an empty box. UPS scales don\u2019t lie. I have proof of the weight of the package when it was shipped. You stole the phone and lied. Simple. Crooks. Pathetic."

          "Contenu": "I recently had to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau on this company. I have sold  several phones with Klymen Electronics over the years. I sold them my phone and it became \u201clost\u201d in the mail when it made it to Rochester, NY. I filed a claim with UPS and Klymen Electronics offered no support, but plenty of lies. They told me I should have purchased insurance when in fact I couldn\u2019t because they were the \u201cshipper\u201d and a representative I spoke with from UPS stated they elected not to do so. I was told I could dispute the claim decision offered by UPS but Klymen Electronics would have to do so. I informed them if they and nothing. When I called and spoke with Alex I attempted to plea with him to do the right thing and compensate me for device or at least help me with the claim and he said \u201cnot my problem\u201d I\u2019ve done business with them for years, however customer loyalty means absolutely nothing to them as Alex told me \u201che didn\u2019t care\u201d he claimed any money UPS offered would be given to me however I spoke with UPS and they told me a check was mailed to them 3 weeks ago and of course they have been completely silent on the matter. I have emails and recorded conversations of my interactions with this company and how nasty they have been throughout this entire process. Please save yourself the headache of having to go through what I went through. I sold them a $1500 phone for $850 and ended up with absolutely nothing. I will never do business with them again."

          "Contenu": "Beware of Unscrupulous Practices at Klyman.com, Prime Electronics LLC, and Klyman on Backmarket.com!I had an incredibly disappointing experience with Klyman.com. Their business practices are highly unscrupulous, and I strongly advise others to steer clear of this company.Initially, they entice you with a high offer for your phone if you ship it to them. However, once they receive the device, they resort to lowballing tactics and significantly reduce the offered price. It's a classic bait-and-switch scheme that leaves customers feeling cheated and taken advantage of.What's even more concerning is their false claims about the condition of the phone. Despite providing them with clear photographic evidence showing the excellent condition of my device, they insisted it was \"strongly dented\" as an excuse to further lower their offer. This level of dishonesty is unacceptable and shows a complete lack of integrity.Transparency, fairness, and honest business practices are essential when engaging in any transaction. Unfortunately, Klyman.com fails to meet these basic standards. I strongly caution against doing business with this company and recommend seeking alternative options for selling your phone, where you can be confident in receiving fair and honest treatment.Choose a reputable company that values its customers and conducts business with integrity. Klyman.com is certainly not one of them, especially through Backmarket.com and others. They also go by Prime Electronics LLC."

It was not broken, it was not at all dirty so they ripped me on a refund arbitrarily gave me 95.00 on a 190.00 purchase. No pictures, no proof just a message claiming the damage and saying shame on you. Not only was their message condescending their claim was not backed up with any proof they just arbitrarily kept what they wanted. AND they have a perfectly good iPad to resell. I am escalating my complaint through eBay until I get satisfaction they screwed me but have great promise.

I saw no activity or updates to the status of my transaction when I logged into their website in the afternoon so I called the phone number listed. A man answered the phone and didn\u2019t introduce himself and asked what I needed. I asked him if they received my phone and he replied yes without asking for any of my information. No order number, tracking number, or even my name. I asked him if he was sure and he answered yes sounding very irritated at me and very rushed and simply hung up the phone while I was in mid sentence. I called back and didn\u2019t get an answer. I did eventually get a confirmation email at the end of the day that said that they had received it and it typically takes 1-2 business days to process and pay. This directly conflicts with their advertising that says they pay the same day that the device is received. It simply doesn\u2019t happen. They had all day and were extremely rude when I called. I marked my phone under \u201cpoor\u201d condition because the screen is cracked-not shattered- and works perfectly fine. That is their definition of the condition of \u201cpoor\u201d. It\u2019s essentailly a new phone with a cracked screen. I am prepared to change my review if they remedy all of this tomorrow. All I expect is for them to just pay me. Otherwise I will be filing a complaint with the BBB link that\u2019s listed on their website for herendous customer service and frankly false advertising. We shall see."

This time I accepted the lower price and was told QUOTE: you will receive the check in the mail within 3-7 days UNQUOTE. 9 days later, nothing and I'm berated because I didn't shoose Pay-Pal? And they STILL have a second phone that was sent with their printed shipping label in the same box as the order they claim to have sent a check for - and they haven't even sent an offer on yet -#11102. Again, ALL I can say is Wow. I don't have to wish bad things to you guys - you're bringing it on yourselves. So... in light of the nasty rebuttal, I'm willing to change this to Two Stars if/when I ever get paid. And I sure would like an offer or my other phone back."

I then emailed Klymen that Verizon said the phone was clear & I also emailed them screen shots of my device from the imei check data base & I showed them where it did say it was lost or stolen & after Verizon fixed it it said it was clear.Then they emailed me saying that it was saying clear on Verizon end but not at AT&T. They wouldn\u2019t buy it until AT&T said it was clear witch AT&T shouldn\u2019t have anything to do with a Verizon phone if Verizon says it clear then it\u2019s clear. I then went to AT&T to check it for myself & there system said it was down couldn\u2019t be checked so I emailed them saying that AT&T was giving a systems down error & how was my device checked as not clear when there system was down. Then next day I emailed them saying that AT&T has it cleared. So yes they are right about it taking awhile for them to clear my device but that was on them Verizon had it fixed the same day as I called them & they new it was cleared threw Verizon but they made me wait until AT&T fixed they system to clear it & that\u2019s the part I wasn\u2019t happy about all the waiting"

But they sent me an email telling me how to do it online. They didn't have to mail my device back. Only issue was trying to talk on the phone. This was my first time using them so I wanted to ensure I wasnt being scammed or anything. The person I spoke with, needs to practice his business phone etiquette a little better. Felt like he was trying to just get u off the phone asap. But now I know they are legit and they pay what was agreed upon on the website, expeditiously. I would definately recommend."
