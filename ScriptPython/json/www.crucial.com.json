So I then contact them on that date and they said we promise it will be with you by two days ago.No refund received. Contact Crucial customer services and they said they will now escalate it and the refund will be processed within 24 hours.Have I received a refund? No. I have to keep chasing and provide the same information over and over again.I am thinking of reporting Crucial to the trading standards as by law they must refund me in a swift manner, and this has been going on over a month now.Beware!"

When I contacted support on 11/10/2023, the support representative said they do not cross-ship and would send a replacement once they received the memory and verified it was defective.Support said I could return the memory for a refund, \u201creturned on 11/17/2023,\u201d but that was not the case. Crucial shipped the replacement memory on 12/8/2023. I contacted support on 11/10/2023. It took Crucial Support over ten days to send the replacement memory \u201cthat I had already replaced.\u201dAgain, use caution if you use their memory for business hardware.

They finally instructed me to return the SSD (at MY expense), then wait and wait for a replacement -- a return that could take 2-3 weeks total. Other companies overnight replacement parts. When Crucial parts fail, they make brand ambassadors like us wait for weeks -- and pay for shipping of THEIR faulty parts. What's more, in the troubleshooting process, the India-based CS team told me to change several BIOS settings which now have caused conflicts with my Operating System. Asking for a fix, their CS Team today told me to completely reformat my disk, meaning I will have to reload Win11 and all the OS updates and then reload and tweak dozens of software programs, just to return my computer to pre-Crucial status. We have long been Crucial brand ambassadors but Crucial CS today is terrible and their incompetence is costing me a lot of money. Shame on Crucial. My social media campaign against Crucial has just begun!"

AS I been using the 96GB kit on it.I did all sorts of troubleshooting, like trying one of the modules from my 96GB kit in that other laptop, and it works, but when trying that new 48GB in any laptop where I been using similar module (also ordered from them as I mentioned) it simply doesn't even let the laptop start, immediate power off after powering on.I can 101% assert that the module I received is indeed defective (I feel like it's shorted inside) based on how my laptop behaves when turned on.I am absolutely disappointed $184 flushed down the drain. Thanks a lot crucial for not allowing returns either.If I could rate you as 0 stars, I would.I have not been able to speak to support either.Unless you must, do not buy directly from them."

He tried to tell me he was on a landline but he was not, cell phones cutting out are unmistakable.  So a) his voice volume was painfully low, b) his accent was SO thick when the line wasn't cutting out I could understand maybe 3 of 10 words c) his line kept cutting out like he was constantly hitting the mute button randomly.  One of the few things I understood the guy say was crucial drives are not compatible with all motherboards/BIOS for mirroring.  This is how they reward their customers for giving them their business.  Sell a product that can't be mirrored, and if they need help? You get routed to Azhbadabalahad in Pakistan who is working from home.  Never again"

When I reminded them I'm a reseller they finally stopped telling me to buy from somebody else, and that they would actually look into the problem.  That was last week, and I still haven't heard anything back.  When I noticed the email asking me to rate my purchase experience (what purchase) just now, I tried submitting another order.  It's still failing.  As I keep saying, the first order I placed on the 25th and originally went through okay.  Later in day it was refunded for some reason.  The credit card company told me there were no issues with the account, and the order cancellation and refund wasn't necessary.  Since then, once I fill in the payment and shipping information and submit the order, it fails.  I've been able the get tax exempt approval from other parts suppliers so I have a source until this gets fixed.  I would like to buy from Crucial, but your web site won't let me.  Please let me know when this issue is fixed, or let me know if I need to fix anything I did wrong."

Said they thought it might be a software conflict on my machine. Had experienced son come over and see if he could install, and no. Contacted cust svc and asked to return, but would have to pay return shipping. It's a small thing, but I didn't feel like I should have to pay to return something they said was guaranteed compatible. So, instead of returning, and because it wasn't a lot of money in the first place, I bought an enclosure from another site and will use said drive as a backup. I will probably not buy from Crucial again because of this experience. I also was a past customer."

Tests determined that the SSD is on its last leg. Moments before the crash a test of read/write speed was performed and it peaked at a disturbing 1,400mbps which is very. Very. Far from it's claim to over 6,000.  The warranty process has not be bad so far, however I am still fresh into the claim and have not received the replacement drive. At this time one additional star given for the fairly simple warranty claim."

That has happened to me several times.  Indeed this time the official USPS record shows that they delivered your shipment was delivered in my mailbox in the early afternoon, when in fact it did not show up on my front porch instead of mailbox until 8:30 pm that day. I do not know if it was a Postal Service employee who put it on my porch or a neighbor who received it by mistake.  Nevertheless, I feel lucky that it did arrive at all.

While the chips arrived in excellent condition i felt like it was lucky that they did because they were NOT boxed and the USPS delivery had folded the padded envelope. To make matters worse the RAM did not arrive in a static/moisture protective barrier like the RAM i ordered from Corsair did. At all most every turn i feel let down my Micron. From order fulfillment time, shipping time/speed, shipping material method, and no environmental protection for the RAM chips to protect against elements/static electricity."

Crucials help desk advised that there was nothing they could do as they delivered in 10 working days and to wait until 04/09. Thats 16 days in real money.On the first fitting of the memory the computer would not boot. There was no display and the power button kept going off. I did try various combinations of old and new memory for the same result.Some research said to leave it for a while (32Gb @ 5-10 minutes). I retried this and my computer is now reporting 32Gb. So how is the memory? Well, its memory and I wouldnt know if its better or worse than other brands.Where things fall down is the delivery times. I could have bought the same from Amazon or eBuyer at the same or lower cost and had next day delivery.If anything does go wrong, I am expected to pay return postage and insurance, and accept all liability. Given the hassle of getting it in the first place I have zero faith in Crucial or their logistics if I need to return it.I hope there are no more problems."

Come to find out crucial's database was not correct. After i stalling, I received an error code I entered into Dell's website in qhich they let me know that either the drive was not compatible or was faulty. Then they offered compatible drives, which was only up to 1TB. I went to Best Buy, bought, installed and it worked fine. So I got to pay return shipping since the Crucial scanner didn't work on my computer and they don't stand by what their database says. Also they wanted me to write the RMA number on the form with the return address. Well they don't have anything that states it is the RMA. They sent two emails. One when opening the return and the other after the return was approved. They provided a return reference number, but they were different on each email. I had to call and ask. Then, the next day, they sent an email clearly stating which number was the RMA#. It is the return reference number on the 2nd email."

Fast Forward to a few chats, I learn that shipping was CLOSED from the 23rd until the 27th. That's fine, I would have had to hunt to find that information out but whatever.... Then, still nothing and find out that my item wasn't even in stock!!  so, AGAIN, nothing in the process that indicated or announced or even flagged that there was a stock issue.  so here we are, 9 BUSINESS days later and my order FINALLY ships. It is suppose to arrive tomorrow but literally 2 weeks from placing an express delivery order.  Sure, I was offered credits on my purchase yada yada, but the entire process was not even close to being good.FYI, The first person who apologised and said it would ship soon, DIDN'T tell me it was out of stock.  I found that out 4 days later in an email."

In all, the delivery took 9 days which, in today's competitive marketplace, is far too slow - even if it was 'free'.

Just a suggestion for you: please allow us to enter PO Boxes on your shipping to address form, maybe as an alternate or backup address. You say you don't deliver to PO Boxes, yet that's what happens after it left your facility. This also happens with Amazon orders, so it's not just happening with your orders. I was very lucky to have received my order this time. Thank you and yes, I love my ram upgrade and the X6. - Todd"

Once he confirmed that the memory they sent was incompatible, they sent me a UPS return label so I didn't have to pay shipping.  I appreciate that.

Two weeks later, I tried to contact them to find out when it would come, and they said I could use one of their partners. Their partners were seventy dollars cheaper for their brand. I canceled my order and purchased elsewhere, and from another brand. Not only was there a lack of communication they were price gouging me. Just about every company in America seems to care less about its customers."

          "Contenu": "I bought an SSD for my desktop PC. I got the expedited shipping this time-way better, came FedEx--no more of that UPS/USPS shared nonsense. The downloadable Acronis cloner still didn't work (I just did this same process with my laptop last month)-it just hangs when you try to clone. And yes, I'm booting clean from a USB directly into the cloning product, not from within Windows. I started it at 8am, came home at 10pm and it said \"16 hours to go\". I started over, and the next morning it said \"3 days to go\". No bueno. I ended up doing an image backup, and then swapping drives, and restoring from that image. That works, just takes longer--a few hours for 1TB. You need a better cloning product partner."

But it was such an obvious issue with the broken delivery tracking link...that, until i received the product, i was fearful that it would never get delivered! Otherwise, the product itself is great!"
