Google's search results were based on location, so all top search results became UK-based. It also caused some other apps to behave abnormally because of the UK location. When I had signal, it was usually weak and speed was slow. I ended up rely mostly on hotel Wifi. I don't recommend Ubigi (at least in the eastern US)."

          "Contenu": "I just used Ubigi for the US after I previously had a good experience in Japan (I previously gave five stars, but i deleted that review). Unfortunately, I have to give a one star review as they are trying to convince me I used 3GB of US data in less than four hours, despite the app previously indicating I used only 60MB. My US plan overlapped with my Japan plan by one day, so I believe really what happened was both plans expired on the same day. Customer Support told me it was probably due to \"5G network overtures\" despite my network mode for the Ubigi eSim bring restricted to 4G. And I was doing usual activity that rarely uses up more than 2GB of data in a week on my 5G network in the UK, let alone a few hours! Anyway, thankfully this frustrating experience made me confirm that my UK carrier had a far superior plan for the US than Ubigi anyway, so this ended up being a complete waste of money."

I was careful to connect to Wifi at hotels and restaurants but it still seemed to count any data as used data from Ubigi. I'd like to be refunded but it's not clear how to connect with their team.Response to reply: I was very careful not to watch any videos or conduct activity that would potentially use too much data. Even then, according to Ubigi, I used 3x as much data as I normally do with much more limited activity. Also, each time I was warned that I had exhausted the data, I would purchase a \"re-up\". Ubigi would not utilize the remaining data from the prior purchase and simply moved onto the next re-up amount leaving unused data on the table."

Wrote to support, never heard back from them. eSIM worked but don't expect any contact from Ubigi if something goes wrong.Edit: to clarify after receiving a reply from Ubigi (funny how quickly they reply to bad reviews as opposed to queries from customers\u2026): I originally purchased a 10gb eSIM from Ubigi. Installed it on my gf\u2019s phone. Downloaded the app on her phone as well. A day later I needed a new eSIM myself. I mistakenly purchased a 10gb top-up from the app, thinking that it would provide a new eSIM QR code that I could scan (this is poorly clarified in the app, but I\u2019ll accept it as my error). I immediately wrote to Ubigi customer support to ask if it was possible to refund the (unused) eSIM, or to transfer it to my phone. No response after THREE WEEKS. However, they\u2019ll quickly respond here. The eSIM works but I recommend Airalo as their customer support is far better. Also, just a tip, avoid using snarky winky faces when replying to customer feedback ;)."

I was locked in at a loading screen for a majority of my attempts. I had to find a location with WiFi and do my best to prepare for having no data despite paying for it. This was a pitiful experience. I have a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra purchased directly from Samsung, I searched through forums to reconfigure my credentials that were initially inaccurate and that still did not improve my internet. All this while at the same time, my brother having purchased the exact same package was having no issues. How Ubigi can be so painfully unreliable with the eSIMs they distribute and configure. Waste of money. Waste of time. Only stress. Will not be using Ubigi again."

My phone would always show full bars for Ubigi LTE, but only actually worked intermittently. Sometimes it would drop to 3G, which was more stable, but obviously very slow. Forcing it to 3G was the only way I could make it reliable. This was in the city too where coverage was always good. I reached out to Ubigi through their contact form (the only way I could figure out how to get in touch) and as of a week later, still no reply. Instead of re-upping with Ubigi I used Airalo and so far so good with a connection through Docomo.Edit: I suppose I might have entered my email incorrectly, but I doubt it. It is possible though that the help request never went through since my data connection was so unstable at the time. I don\u2019t know why I had to search their website for the contact form at all when I was already logged into the app. Seems like a help button there with all my details preloaded would\u2019ve avoided all the trouble."

I've got 5g preferred set on my mobile connection settings, I've attempted to manually set the service provider but DoCoMo isn't an option to choose and KDDI can't be selected. Ubigi is the only option. It's supposed to automatically connect to the DoCoMo network when selected but sometimes it's a horrible connection. I looked at where my IP was and somehow it's often coming from France. Don't get me wrong, if I paid for 4g then I'd be totally happy with the service. While the 4g lte is fine most of the time sometimes it's absolutely trash and I need it to work because I'm working remotely.I bought 5g and expected to do some cloud gaming but the connection is no where good enough.I've got a Galaxy Fold 3.-- edit: I've contacted them with the info they've requested, waiting to hear back --"

Service would cut in and out for no noticeable reason, even when I was sitting in one place. It would be there, full bars, for about a minute and then be gone, no service at all, for about two. It was, unfortunately, completely unusable.For Japan, it's a 5/5. No connectivity issues, it's been strong everywhere, works great.Averaged out, that's a 3/5. Do not use in southeast Asia, use without concern in Japan."

Because I could not get any customer service, I ended up deleting both eSIMs and gave up.  Complete waste of $48 because of zero customer service.  Regardless of directions and videos, some customers will have a problem.  You need to provide a service for them too.Addendum:  Ubigi sent email soon after my review first posted, and they corresponded repeatedly until both eSIMs were recovered and connected to the data plans I had purchased.  Hence my rating is changed from 1 to 3 stars.It is 3, not 4 or higher, because my wife\u2019s data plan is still not 100%.  While it works and she is clearly using some Ubigi data as intended, somehow our primary cell plan is still getting data requests and therefore charging us $10/day for international data.  Perhaps this is our mistake in how the phone is set up, nonetheless it totally defeats the purpose of buying an additional data plan as offered by Ubigi (and competitors)."

It sucks running out of data and are now unable to navigate without data and topping up at this point makes no sense."

It connected to 4G and then dropped after 10 min, requiring me to manually reconnect each time I wanted to use the internet. That basically make the physical SIM unusable.The Ubigi eSIM saved the day; it worked smoothly and fast in Japan on my phone. Ubigi gave me a reliable 4G data plan. Ubigi was also priced fairly. I will use it going forward and recommended it on Reddit."

So didn't need the entire 50 gb. But if you're using it for hot spot and other video intensive work you may need that much data! Food for thought."

I activated my 30-day plan the day before I left. I was staying less than 30 days, so it didn't matter that I was not in Japan at the time. Ubigi was running perfectly when I got to Narita airport, and I was ready to go while my traveling companions were still figuring out their physical SIM cards and portable wifi devices. I ended up running out of my initially chosen plan, 3 GB, and I ended up buying 10GB. It was money well spent. Thank you for the complete service, and I am pretty sure I had service nearly everywhere I went in Japan, including some more rural areas. I never ran into any issues where I would need customer service, so I cannot comment on that."
