          "Contenu": "Fraudulent way of operating and terrible service.Ordered an Apple watch ultra with alpine loop size medium. Initially, the order came in with a random black watch strap. Mistakes like that can happen of course.Upon contacting them, indicating that they provided me with the wrong strap and have to provide the product as mentioned: Apple watch with Alpine loop size medium. They then told me they could send \u20ac euros as a replacement. No, of course not I indicated, what I bought was as mentioned so that is what they are obliged to provide. Without any further discussion they then said that they would send the right loop.Then, when I received what was supposed to be the Apple Alpine loop, in reality it was a very cheap Chinese replacement?! Ridiculous, but even worse, it is basically scamming people by providing a different product as mentioned in product description AND product photo.Two and a half weeks down the line and nothing has been resolved.These loops costs \u20ac100 new price. This will be followed up by legal action."

Instead, a replacement watch shows up a few days later without even informing me. When I reminded them that they told me they would give me a refund, they completely went back on their word because THEY made a mistake. That should not be my problem but because of their poor customer service, it is now my problem. Don\u2019t waste your money on their poorly refurbished products and buy somewhere else."

They never mentioned anywhere that they were selling refurbished items on Walmart's site. I bought a New phone and received a used phone. This must be an ongoing scam bc they offered a discount to keep the used phone. I purchased a new phone elsewhere for less than they charged for a used phone. They have tied up my money, delayed my getting a better deal and caused me inconvenience of having to return item to Walmart. Loop has been notified by Walmart on numerous occasions and is fully aware of the situation. Even after learning that the site says \"new condition\" they have yet to correct the page and continue selling refurbished phones. I made my purchase on 11/16/22 on Walmart.com, the phone was returned to Walmart the day after being received and out for return delivery via Fed Ex. I'm still waiting for my credit."

Also, I was told I was gonna get updates about my shipment but I didn\u2019t get ANYTHING. The only thing I saw was that my order was placed nothing else. On Wednesday, If I didn\u2019t complain about my phone not coming or saying I would never use Loop mobile again. I don\u2019t know if would have got my phone or not or it would came much later. Furthermore, my order came a week later after my order and that was unacceptable especially when I didn\u2019t get any update about my order AT ALL.

          "Contenu": "UPDATE: I was finally able to reach someone via this email address - info [at] loopmobile.us - and get a return sorted out. About a week after shipping the return, I got confirmation of my refund. I guess I'd just say shop at your own risk here, and know that the customer service phone line is kind of a dead end. Will recommend Computer Overhauls again as a good and reputable small business with quick shipping and good service.--Ordered a MacBook Air from Loop Mobile. After reading a handful of negative reviews about customer service, I figured the majority were positive and the price was right. It arrived in about 3 days, and when I opened it, not only was it packaged very loosely, it was not the computer I ordered. I immediately called the customer service line but countless attempts at different times of day have been answered by an automated \"There are no agents available to take your call\" message, and my email has gone unanswered for several days now. Luckily I did a payment plan, so only a portion of the cost is lost so far, but 3 additional payments are due to be drafted from my account for a computer I didn't order and don't want. I'm trying to return the one that was mistakenly delivered and just cancel my order for a refund, if someone will respond to me. For other customers, I'd recommend Backmarket (though they sell through there too, that's where I initially found them but prices were cheaper to order directly through the site) or Computer Overhauls instead."

The video board failed six weeks later, and it took a lot of extra effort and time to get the warranty filled. But after five weeks, I had a nice replacement machine, which happened to be 1 year newer than the one I originally purchased. Longer story: To start with, the original order took 10 days to arrive via FedEx Ground (Ok, it was Christmas time). The computer was poorly packed, actually rattling around loose in the box.The computer's video board failed six weeks later, and getting warranty service under their 12-month warranty, was a challenge. There was no order confirmation email, and no clear way to get warranty coverage on the website. I found the customer support link on the bottom of the home page, replied to their request for photos immediately...and it took 7 days to get a shipping label. Shipping each way took a week, processing the return took a week, so the warranty process took 4 weeks. That was a long time to be without a computer!Ultimately, I got a good machine at a good price. But don't expect things to arrive as promptly as their website suggests, or warranty coverage to be super easy like the big competitors."

I had it shipped it to my home, hoping they'd come through quickly, and they did!  So it all worked out.  The phone came the night before we left.  But based on a few of their bad reviews, I thought they'd pay more attention to the emails.  They didn't, but like I said, the order was processed and the shipped as fast as possible so it worked out great.  Just a couple days of nail-biting."

I\u2019m always at work during the 10a-5p window, so making arrangements to be home to sign for the delivery was sort of a pain in the butt. Yes I could\u2019ve arranged for a pickup on their website, but I\u2019ve had packages \u201cdisappear\u201d like that before so I\u2019m always leery of going that route. Once I did receive the package, I discovered that they sent me the wrong color Apple watch. I was disappointed but the watch worked fine and I really wasn\u2019t up to the whole return process, so I just kept the one they sent. The watch was in much better condition than I expected, having opted for one in \u201cfair condition\u201d. Very good value for the price.**Update** Jeannie from (I\u2019m assuming) customer service, reached out to me regarding the wrong color being sent out. She apologized and offered me a partial credit for the inconvenience, since I did not want to deal with the returns process. Mistakes happen. I\u2019ll accept that gesture as a sign that Loop Mobile wants to do right by their customers. For that reason I\u2019m definitely comfortable giving them five stars and would recommend them to others."

I either found watches that I felt like were too expensive for me or the sites had very bad reviews. Right when I was going to give up I ran into this site. I looked up previous customers reviews and they sold me. I was able to order what I was looking for and at a very reasonable price. When I got it from the delivery service I was blown away. It looked like a brand new watch, nobody would think that it was refurbished. So it looked good but I didn't know if the quality would match up. It did! Everything has been great. It charges to 100%, there were no flaws visually, and all of the features work perfectly. I am very happy that I found this site and made my purchase through them."
