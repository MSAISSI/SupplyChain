          "Titre": "Stay away from Firmroom",
          "Contenu": "The VDR was initially frustratingly slow, but got continually better over time (the deal lasted over a year). The real problem was the service and support; we had two major problems with Firmroom.(i) We had two deals simultaneously with Firmroom and one time, one client took more than 10 (ten) days to pay the VDR provider. Firmroom adopted a gangster attitude and decided to shut down both VDRs. This is ridiculous because both our deals had nothing to do with each other. Our clients were responsible for payment of their respective VDRs, not us, but Firmroom decided to pressure us -the advisor- by shutting down its service to ALL our clients. This shutdown lasted until the other client paid the invoice. It was extremely unprofessional and almost cost us (and our other client) deal.(ii) To close the deal, our client required pendrives as back-up of the VDR (which is standard). Even though Firmroom was notified with more than a month of time, they were incapable of getting the pendrives to us (3 months after the request they still haven't arrived, they have been 'in route' for almost 2 months, the deal is closed by now). In the end we had to download a special software and encrypt the pendrives ourselves. Pathetic.Going forward, we will NEVER recommend Firmroom to a client."

Overall, I highly recommend FirmRoom to anyone looking for secure, user-friendly, and feature-packed data room software."
