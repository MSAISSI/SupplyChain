I suddenly couldn't connect to any of their servers.I reached out to their support team, hoping for a fix. But when I mentioned where I was located, they dropped a bombshell \u2013 they don't serve my region anymore. This was a shocker, considering I have a paid, active subscription.It's frustrating and just plain wrong. If you're a paying customer, you expect them to support you.Update:I decided to give them another shot after they responded to my review. Unfortunately, they stuck to their guns, saying there were no refunds or solutions. They're based in the United States, so you'd think they'd play by the rules.It's a bummer that they decided to cut me off from the service I paid for, with no chance of a refund. This situation makes you wonder how they'd react if government requests your data!"

Strong is like any other big group.They want your $ and they want you to give them glowing reviews.They do not respond to criticism and they want to tell you your case is \"Solved\" even if they haven't done anything to solve it.  I left very unhappy.Buyer beware."

I was looking for a VPN service to use temporarily, and \"How To Geek\" recommended them.  I won't be trusting them anymore either.  Once purchased, I received an email with user and password info.  Following instructions was not clear.  I had to download an app to connect.  Windows wouldn't allow the download.  I contacted StrongVPN for my money back, and they said use a different browser.  I finally got the app to download, and signed on.  Google was displayed in Arabic fonts with a link to English.  I had to wait several times while the service buffered while using it.

Recently Strong VPN changed their servers forcing customers onto a new one and sent out changeover instructions to make the switch to the new server. However, the new server which is based in the Netherlands is terrible and a once great service is now a nightmare. The service constantly drops out, is slow and stops working without warning. Forget watching a film or listening to a radio without interruption as virtually every few minutes there is a problem. I've already complained to Strong VPN customer service but nothing has changed and be very wary signing up to them based upon reliability of service as this is now very unreliable! It's a shame as Strong VPN used to be so good but if it continues I will leave and find another VPN as the service is becoming almost impossible to use without constant interruptions!"

          "Contenu": "I had this service in China back in 2016 and it frequently wouldn't work, always being blocked, so when it came up for renewal in 2017 as I was leaving China decided to cancel. They sent me a notice saying I needed to enter new payment details for my service to continue, but instead I responded saying no thanks, I would like to cancel. Fast forward to 2021 and I get another renewal notice. So, thinking it was strange, I investigated.Turns out that the email I received and responded to was a no-reply email, there was nothing in the email to tell you that unless you checked for it hidden away in the email address, plus there was no automated response to tell you that you had emailed an unmonitored address! It was all set up to catch out the unwary. There was also no link to cancel, just a \"give us new credit card details here\". Couldn't have gone to their site at the time anyhow as their web address was blocked!Turns out that they continued the service and continued taking money despite it being an expired credit card, despite the service never being used, and kept on taking it even though the service was clearly unused.Yes I know I should have seen it on my credit card but I didn't. But, also, I have up until 2021 never received any renewal notice and have never received a payment invoice, otherwise I would have known earlier.I have never used the service, I switched to ExpressVPN and can prove I had that MUCH SUPERIOR service during that time.Contacting them, they initially didn't want to know, but eventually returned the one payment from 2020, but refused to return the other 3 payments saying it was against their T&C to refund such old payments.I will be contacting the bank, but am sure they also will say it is too old but would be interesting to hear how they can use expired credit card details. They have found a loophole in the system to keep taking money from people, just a scam."

It made my system (Microsoft Surface Pro 2) inoperable.\r So I used their customer service.  I was about 2 minutes with the first person who said they would get a tech person, and then waited 15 minutes for the tech person, who had me install support software so that he could operate my computer remotely.  After about 45 more minutes he didn't have it working...  \"It's not working\" he said lamely.  So we gave up.\r I expected that they would open a service ticket and get back to me, but not hearing anything for 2 days, I emailed them with my problem, asking for a fix or my money back.  5 days later, conveniently outside of their 7 day \"money back guarantee\" window, I get an email with my problem listed as medium priority and couple questions like where I am (which you tell them when you sign up for the service) and how I connect.\r So...  I'm getting no love from Strong VPN.  Take your chances.  Looks like a lot of people are getting good service and find it a good product, however, I  might add, that it is a psychological fact that when it appears that a vast majority of people have a particular belief, those who don't agree tend to keep quiet about their views.  This is even true with online reviews.  So take your guess: am I just really unlucky? or did I just get ripped off?  Since StrongVPN hasn't solved my problem, or given me my money back right now I'm thinking option 2."

When there is a problem reported (as I had late last year),the answers given are often conflicting from service person to service person (thats a problem as well -each time you contact Strong on an issue (same issue) you get someone else, and not the same person you thought you were dealing with). last- general communication, while no news is usually a good thing It would be nice to see some type of communication that keeps the customer informed of any changes, updates new options etc.."

You were working on this six months ago but still no progress.The work around you suggested - which was to use the DNS service - is not viable, since the carriers apply bandwidth restrictions (throttling) which stops the streaming.  The result is that the user has to pause the stream, ESC the full screen, reload the page, and then select the restart option from ITV.  This may be okay for one occurrence and hour, but some carriers do repeated stops every few minutes which destroys the value of streaming a TV show.  This is ongoing and I suspect a permanent problem - new users beware!"

I did like their service when I got to use it, but not sending email reminders about renewals is unethical.  Best practice should be to send reminders about upcoming renewals for ALL subscription services.  We are in subscription hell these days. It's impossible to keep up with all of them...  Do better."

But first, the positives:+ Virtually no speed drop. You hardly feel you're using a VPN bridge+ Wide range of servers to pick from around the world, although that bit is open to improvement (no servers in Japan, for instance).+ Stable, seamless, efficient connection. With the help of the client automatizing the switch, you don't have to worry about micromanaging your connection settings. Even if the client fails, your native connection is simply restored without a hassle.+ Good customer service and long-time customer benefits.And now why I give 4/5 instead of full honors:- Occasional, admittedly infrequent downtime. It doesn't happen too often but when it happens, it happens.- Recent price rise. The US thinks it has an inflation problem. Those of us who have become used to living under constant hyperinflation and devaluation policies are laughing. Sorry for not being able to empathize.- Clunky interface. You can only turn off the client from the system tray (which is a downgrade from earlier versions a few years ago) and sometimes, if thankfully not very often, it silently crashes."

We have been on the web for over 30 years and have had our share of non-responsive hosting companies so take our word you could do a lot worse and spend a whole lot more money with someone else."

As this was the prime reason we signed up for a VPN it is obviously very disappointing. The customer support service team are always very helpful and quick to respond but at the moment we keep getting the same response \u201cwe are currently working on it\u201d. Over the years that we have been customers we have recommended our friends and relatives to StrongVPN who have also signed up but unfortunately they are also having the same issues and are now reviewing their options also. We wish StrongVPN all the very best as they have given us excellent service up to now but we need more stability for our BBC connection."

It's a challenge to connect at times, and often requires a reboot to clear caches before a connection is possible, but once connected on OSX Mojave, the service is locked in.  IOS IKEv2 protocol is more variable, slow to connect, and generally only good for 1-2 minutes before disconnecting.  I use StrongVPN interchangeably with a SSL (socks) proxy server giving me the security of always being able to contact StrongVPN through the Socks host and vice versa for service.  I am satisfied with the StrongVPN service except for the IOS version, and a customer continuously for ~6 years."

SugarSync\u00ae works fast enough and doesn't require a VPN in China.3. The online customer support works with very high efficiency.The disadvantages (only for connections from China):1. The VPN connection speed is not always stable compared with the competitors.2. The newest version of the app doesn't work for China, we only use the old one.3. The old version of the app is a little old school, if you use it with an Android TV, you will need a mouse to navigate, while the new version used to work ok with the remote controller buttons.4. Split tunnel is not available. If you connect the VPN from China, the Chinese websites/apps will not work well, and if you don't connect the VPN the other international websites/app will not work well. So you have to switch on and off manually all the time."

I'm still unable to get Amazon Prime US working, had to get PureVPN to get that working.Lately I have been using the VPN mostly on my Amazon FireTV 4K. I'm sure with all the data you are aware that most of your users are using the VPN for streaming services. One grievance I have - I wish you would help us more with Netflix blocks, I wish you had a way to collect quick feedback from customers when Netflix can identify the VPN from a server or city and you can refresh the IP's quicker.One other small feedback, please tweak the UI of the FireTV 4K app a little. The timer and the IP address is always a little covered because its too much in the corner.Overall I rely on your service heavily, your support staff has always been great but I wish you'd make things a little better for streamers by collecting quick feedback when Netflix starts identifying VPN's."
