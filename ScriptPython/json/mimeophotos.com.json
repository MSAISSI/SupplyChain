And the tracking information at DHL is terrible in that they rarely give you up dates.My guess is that you moved ago DHL from FedEx (who were excellent!) as a cost saving measure. The problem is that DHL is antagonizing long term customers (such as us) and running the risk of losing them to another photo service. Not worth the cost savings!!"

No words adequately describe how poor they were to deal with.They email with conflicting advice regularly, indicating they have the wrong address, despite it being correct on all three items we ordered and we would have to pick them up at one of their depots, despite paying for home delivery. They also said that they had tried to deliver two of them, despite us being home all of the day. The Canadian lady I spoke to had no idea how Canadian addresses were organized. I cannot use Mimeo again if they use DHL to deliver items as it is too frustrating. I would not be surprised if DHL is not delivering packages much longer as they seem to be struggling."

The platform has some major faults when trying to go back to make changes. After being told I could go back to last save by online chat, this is not the case. It will only go back a few changes. You also cannot rename project and save as different project which would have been a major helpAn update after your reply. The current version of Apple does not allow duplicates to be made and it most definitely does not allow you to rename. I think your platform needs a major overhaul with registration to Apple users. It\u2019s a pity because the finished product is lovely quality."

          "Contenu": "I contacted Mimeo several times about my order for my daughter's 9th birthday, as my tracking number wasn't working, as I was concerned that there was an error, especially as I paid a higher shipping fee to ensure on-time delivery for her special day. I was assured several times that my book was en route by Mimeo, despite the tracking number needing to be fixed. When the expected delivery date passed, I contacted Mimeo for the third time, inquiring about my delivery. Only after the third contact, Mimeo told me there was an \"unexpected problem\" with my tracking number and, therefore, they would ship me another order. I received my order one week after my daughter's birthday. I've always had a great experience with Mimeo. Still, this delay could have been avoided, and I am at a loss as to why I would pay a higher shipping cost only to receive my book a week later, especially when I contacted Mimeo when there seemed to be a problem with shipping from the get-go. I would love to get a refund on my expedited shipping costs, especially since this could have been avoided."

Also, the default margin between photos is too small, but the next default size up is too big!  It would be nice if the space between photos were more easy to adjust.Finally, when I got everything placed where I wanted it, I was excited for the final product.  Two of my albums arrived banged up in one corner and all three had grainy images--shouldn't the print quality be better for $150???"

That would actually save time in terms of data entering dates year after year.  Apple photos used to let us do that.  I create and purchase 10-12 calendars every year and it literally takes me 2-3 weeks part time to complete all data entry and photo choice and layout.  I wasn\u2019t going to do it this year, but the recipients really like the calendar.  This may be my last time and I am going to warn others that this while the product is lovely, it is takes a lot of time to produce that I\u2019ll never get back.  I would add that it\u2019s disappointing to see that Mimeo has asked for and seen feedback similar to mine for years, but refuses to do anything in terms of rectifying the situation."

After investing hours of work to make a book at a pre disclosed price, you are hit with the added cost of unreasonably high postage. These are books and can go at a low book rate. If you search the internet and the stars are alined, you might find a discount code to offset part of the postage... maybe not. It would be much better to offer your quality product at a total price that seems fair and not engage in a form of subterfuge."

Using custom layouts isn\u2019t feasible because you don\u2019t have a ruler so it\u2019s impossible to make symmetrical and same-sized layouts. Especially you need to add 8 vertical pages, 6 vertical pages, mixes of 7.  You prioritize square photos but iPhone default is 4x3 aspect ratios.  Your layouts mostly leave border, but you can print to the edges, so give that option more. This all seems so easy to add!!  Check the old layouts Apple used to offer on iPhoto. Your print quality is good otherwise.  Also it could be easier to drag/switch a placed photo without deleting and re-adding. But way more layout options is MAJOR way you could improve.  Thanks!"

I do find the font hard to read in the text box but I think there a couple of lines on about 6 pages on this occasion which I think are faulty. I have since received another hard cover book from a recent trip to Italy which is fine.

I have to re-type in every event every year.  iPhoto used to let you import .ics calendar files.  I would love to see that feature in Mimeo Photos.  Similarly, iPhoto used to let you drag and drop photos onto calendar dates, like you can for the main monthly photos.

Your help staff is beyond helpful...and very quickly I might add. The only improvement I could suggest is that the calendar photos are a little more contrasty than the books. I think it's due to the color saturation I like to use. Less is more on these smaller photos. I loved that I was able to make use of the multiple discounts this year. Nice Mimeo, Thank You"

Having ordered 30 copies of a book, quality was maintained.  On a rare occasion, a flaw in printing might happen and if so, the support team responds quickly and issues a reprint. In terms of advice to users, plan ahead so one can use economy (the least expensive) shipping. Do note that the book cost remains the same no matter how many are ordered and reductions for shipping for multiple copies are minimal.  For Mimeo, I look forward to more layout options than just for titles and captions when book requires a significant amount of text as well as photos. I was able to enter a lot of text, doing my own page design, but it was hard, for example, to keep columns of text even. But - it did work and the results were very good."

          "Contenu": "I was looking for a photobook company that I could use for my different photobook projects after Apple stopped providing their services. I am very happy with the Mimeo product and will use it again. The program is similar to the late Apple one and is easy to work with. Upload and purchase were easy, and the production time was very reasonable. My only advice is to make it clearer that Mimeo is filling Apple's shoes. I do not know what is possible legally, but it was not 100% clear to me before I started to build my project. I would spend more time on my review if the request would come from Mimeo directly. I know the Truspoint is legitimate, but it is not the same."
