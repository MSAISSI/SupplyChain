          "Contenu": "I decided to send several orders of CDs to eagle savers. My experience has not been good the first shipment of orders sent off was quoted at 600.00. I was only paid 378.00 and even though FedEx had record of all boxes sent to eagle savers. I got email saying half over half of my shipment was missing from one order. I requested my items be sent back and received a response say they keep order open in case I found the items they didn't receive. I've sent several emails asking eaglesaver to send my property back or issues payments what did arrive. As of now eagle savers has ripped me off for 147.00 and refuse to acknowledge my email requesting order be sent back to me. According to FedEx Eagle Savers received the last order on December 4th 2023 11:00am quoted at 252.13. I have not received any responses from eagle savers after sending several emails asking  when payment would be issued. My experience dealing with eagle savers has been terrible."

I responded YES the same day I received their email. I've not received the CDs back or had responses to my repeat emails. It's been over 2 months.  Very disappointed.12/1/2023 - Eagle Saver addressed the issue with a full credit for the CDs. My thanks goes out to them."

I had what seemesd like all the higher paying dvd's removed from the payment.

When given the list of items to be returned, I stated that I didn't wish to accept their offer and asked for the entirety of my items shipped back and payment to be halted. As I stated earlier they do as they wish and it takes a week or more if they ever reply. SO YES, THEY'RE THE EPITOME OF SCAM ARTISTS. It's ok I filed my complaints already. BBB score of F and 1 \ud83c\udf1f. Get a CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER! After receiving my so called heavily damaged items, I found out of the 13(heavily damaged) items, 1 DVD and 2 CD's had ZERO scratches, abrasions or blemishes. To be fair the other 10 did have some heavy wear but nothing that'd prevent them from playing without skipping. I checked every one before I shipped them. This is what happens when you refuse to communicate to your customers. By ignoring the customer they can manipulate the transaction anyway they see fit to increase their profits and lower the quote they give you!"

And, again, I will probably be blamed and my payout will be reduced.What a reasonably-run company would do is to apologize for their error and immediately forward the money I am owed for what was originally offered (maybe with a \"good will\" extra credit), when I sold the CDs to them. Of course, good luck with that..."

When I received some of these items they were damaged cosmetically, and this wasn\u2019t from shipping. The dvd series cover was ripped off from the front and back. I confronted Eaglesaver about this. They offered a 50% off refund for its value. I accepted the offer. I have yet to get the refund, and it\u2019s been 2 months of me emailing them literally everyday. Some days they take 48 hours to get back, sometimes it takes them 6 days to get back. Last time I checked a clerk sent me a memo on PayPal for me to pay Eaglesaver the 50% refund. I emailed them to correct it, it\u2019s been 4 days, and they still have not emailed me back. I even called and left a message 1-2 weeks ago, and still nothing. Again, I\u2019m emailing them everyday and no one is getting back to me. A huge disappointment."

After I had entered them and wanted to check out, I was told my order did not meet the 75 cents average item minimum and I should remove some lower priced items. This is rather ridiculous when they are paying 16 to 25 cents for many cds. This should be made clear before you enter items.  I removed low priced items and tried to check out. I have been on the site before but I could not reset my password. I got the reset emails so I know my account was on file. I left the website and re-installed the app and was able to log in, but my cart was gone. I had to re-enter the cds. All this for $26.00! Also, on the app you can scan the barcodes, from the website you have to enter them manually. A little note on the website saying \u201cInstall the app and you can use a scanner\u201d would have saved a lot of time. All I have left is the low-priced cds, so I won\u2019t be using EagleSaver again."

Their customer service has gone downhill and their business practices are worthless. They receive thousands of dollars worth of merchandise but are too lazy to update the order to acknowledge receipt. Now it appears that they will steal your merchandise without even paying for it. They give you deadlines to meet as a customer but they don\u2019t do the basics such as updating the order status. With everything going on in the world, they should do everything possible to pay their customers as quickly as they claim to and answer emails."

In my opinion, it was close to \"New\", and maybe if they took off some of the money I was to receive, I could see it. But to GET NOTHING for it was totally awful !! I would not waste my precious time in the future dealing with Eaglesaver- what I expected and what I got were two different things!! Thanks but No thanks......"

I recently gave Eaglesaver a 5-star review because I'd never had any serious problems with them during a long period as a regular customer and veteran of well over 100 shipments. However, on my latest smaller shipment than usual, they contend that one DVD was missing. No, it was not. I distinctly remember packing this brand new and sealed DVD set. If it went missing, it's due either to incompetence or a less than honest employee who simply filched it. It also happened to be the most expensive item. Anyway, payment was issued after subtracting this DVD. As they know, I've been totally honest with them during a long period as a very satisfied customer. So this is disconcerting, and efforts to communicate with them so far has gone unanswered. I would have expected better and am very disappointed at being used in this way by what otherwise has been a topflight company. A shame. Sincerely, Ed Bark"

Overall my advise is to keep up with the orders you submit. I feel like they didn't fully go through my order to see that I sent all the CDs. They sure weren't at my house! I do not believe they missed my CDs on purpose and they corrected the issue. However I had to take the time to figure out why my quote was lower and it should have been gone through correctly the first time. I'm 100% satisfied with the customer service but due to them not going through my order to see I sent all the CDs will never sell to them again. I got my full quote but I had a bad experience overall."

          "Contenu": "Final Update-After getting my second response from the BBB 10 days ago, Eagle Saver did finally send me payment via paypal today.Update- The company never emailed or called me back. So, I had to file a BBB complaint. Their response ignored the error that they had originally promised to look into, and just said that they could not accept without the book. They really did not answer my complaint or question. It has been a week since I responded to the company's response. I wish the company would have just communicate with me either way in the beginning, because by them ignoring me I am out my blu ray set and the quoted price. Original review-This is the second time that I used them. The first time went smoothly, but beware when they make an error it feels like they are not going to correct. They e-mailed me late last  Wednesday that they couldn't accept my Blu-Ray for Cinderella, since the book from the set was missing. I e-mailed them back right away that this was an error, because the book is attached and actually a part of the Blu-Ray case. I think that the person checking them must have not noticed since the pages were crisp and new (I never used the book part).I received an e-mailed Thursday morning from them, saying that they would look into it and get back to me shortly. After waiting to hear something all day Friday, I e-mailed again to see how correcting the error was going. By midday Monday, I tried calling since still not hearing from them after Thurday morning. I left a voicemail, since there is no way to get a hold of a person on the phone.I am worried that they will give away the Blu-Ray away before they get around to looking into it. I don't really want them to just send the Blu-Ray set back, since I cannot be sure it will come back in the same condition that I sent it, since the case is cardboard. I made sure to package it special.If there is an error on their part, you do not get your quoted price the next day as advertised. I am still waiting to see if you get it back at all."

I have, however, received items back with the reason listed as \u201cheavy damage\u201d, yet upon inspection they are pretty much flawless. Communication is lacking. Don\u2019t bother calling, even though the website says to call regarding questions, you\u2019ll never get an answer or response. Time for turn over from sending, delivery and payment is good.  The 1st 2 times I sent items they accepted them all. The following 2 times they sent 1/2 of them back. The quality of items didn\u2019t change, therefore I\u2019m not sure the reason for the refusal. Their scanner is basically useless, and you\u2019ll need to spend a lot of time punching in all of the numbers. Many of their upc codes are wrong, and when you contact them or send in the correct upc code, they disregard the information, even though the website tells you to contact them if the upc is coming up wrong?!? Not sure why the quality of the scanner is to poor. I utilize other sell back apps and they have awesome scanners. Overall, not a bad site, and to reiterate\u2026 I do appreciate the company sending the items back. I have disregarded other sites due to the lack of this service. Not a perfect system, but not horrible either."

I finally left a 1 star review on Monday 2/13 and low and behold the next day I get an email that my order has arrived and is being processed. I feel you need to update your website from stating that your order will be processed when delivered and payment within the next 24 hours because that is not my experience. My order sat there since 2/8 with FedEx delivery proof and didn't get processed until 2/14. There was no contact from customer service. As stated above no replies to my numerous emails or phone call inquires. With so many scams out there just be transparent with your process. EagleSaver did accept more DVDs than DeCluttr and at better pricing and the process was very easy. The reason for the 3 stars is for the lack of customer service and the stress I felt for thinking I was being scammed."

I spent 2 hours keying the 100+ DVDs I had into their system to get a quote and EagleSaver ended up wanting 72 of them. Yay, so I thought. The process was super simple up until my package was delivered to them. Package was delivered on Wednesday 2/8/23 and the website says that you will be paid the next day well here we are 5 days after my package was delivered and my account says still waiting on shipment. I sent an email to them on Friday 2/11 to check on an update and sent them the FedEx delivery confirmation as well, did not hear back. I tried to call them later Friday evening but their hours are 8-5 Pacific time which is strange because the package was delivered to Florida. So needless to say the I did not hear back. Here we are Monday evening and 2 emails later no response and no update to my account. I also called, no one available to take my call leave a message, I did. Here we are at 6 PM on Monday and still have not heard from them. I called them again and pushed 2 instead of 1 hoping to get someone on the phone and again no one available to take my call, leave a message. Now I will be hitting 6 days past my package was delivered to them, 2 emails and 2 phone messages and I still have no update. I am out 72 brand new DVDs and no funds as promised on their site. Just beware. I know some reviews are good and some are not this has just been my experience with them. If they contact me or fulfill their end of the deal I will update but as of right now I don't have much faith in that considering the website says you will be paid the day after delivery and here we are 5 days later and I cannot even get someone to email or talk to me.2/15/23 Edit - My order was processed on 2/14 and I did leave another review. Like I said in that review. With all the scams going on nowadays just be transparent or have someone in customer service available to answer customers concerns. Had I been notified that they were behind schedule the process would have not have been stressful at all. It was really easy to navigate their site and print labels and their prices beat DeCluttr and they also took more DVDs than them too. I will be using EagleSaver again. and recommending should someone need this kind of service. Updating from 1 star to 3 just due to the lack of customer service."

I assume you use that canned answer for anything you just decide you don't want after receiving the shipment.  I know I have sent items that have never been used more than one time and were kept in their cases rejected for excessive use/scratches.  When I ship off my items I have an expectation that they are in good shape, cases are not broken and the money I've been quoted will be paid.  This doesn't happen and is frustrating."

Another problem I had was the fact that the site I sold most of my DVD's to had bulk pricing which made the transaction go easier. Where Eaglesaver does not offer Bulk and I had to individually place each upc number in and press enter. To make the shopping experience better I suggest offering a little more for DVD's and offer Bulk pricing like most of your competitors."

Their app couldn't be easier.so far, the biggest problem is getting payment:  out of five packages sent to EagleSaver, i have only received payment for two.  a third is said to be on the way, but i still haven't received it. i'm hoping their responsiveness will get better."

Amazing customer service (they email you back within the business day which I was pleasantly surprised by how fast it was). Not shady! Legit! :) Very happy about that.Cons: There are all these limitations around what you can donate and how much i.e. the .75 average price per item and the $20 minimum. This should be explicitly detailed right there on the front page. I spent an hour manually entering UPCs and ISBNs only to keep getting rejected due to the .75 average price and $20 minimum requirement. When I asked customer service why this is and that it should be placed on the front page, they gave me some excuse why they couldn't do that. But that just felt like BS to me. They said it's on the FAQs page but it's not explicitly stated there. This was my only friction and hence why I rated it 3 stars instead of 5. Also there's the limitation of the quote expiring in 4 days. I was literally a minute after my expiration date and then they no longer accepted a handful of my items! You can imagine how frustrating that was given what I already stated above."

I had to email ES to ask for status after only seeing \"awaiting shipment\" on my account for 2 weeks. They responded  to my email within 2 days saying they received it and payment was coming (so that was good). So ES just needs to communicate a little better and send an email to sellers when order is received with a payment ETA."

          "Contenu": "This transaction went smooth. I only sent a few items and there were no deductions. In the past I\u2019ve had severe deductions. For example, my last transaction I sent many DVDS and CDS. The entire transaction was rejected! I spent a lot of time and effort into that (scanning items, cleaning/replacing cases, cleaning discs in a professional machine, packing the items, shipping the box, etc.) only to get a zero return! Not even a reduced or partial offer. I would have been better off using a different buyer who pays a little less but honors their agreement. Next time I will have to explore other buyer options unless you can explain and change my mind? I have been using EagleSaver for a long time now and made many transactions with them. All of my transactions have had price deductions (which obviously didn\u2019t/doesn\u2019t make me happy) but the transactions were processed nonetheless. Can you help?Regards,Gregory Crowley"

I was surprised at some DVDs that had a much higher value than I thought. I finished the process, accepted eagle savers offer, printed out my FedEx label and paperwork. note it was easier to complete my order on my laptop. Boxed up my order and dropped it off at fedex. My only complaint is it took 4 more days to get paid than quoted but that's acceptable. It would be more helpful for the account page to acknowledge receipt of goods when it reaches their warehouse. I would do business with them again."

          "Contenu": "First the good.  EagleSaver has proven to be an honest and reliable company.  No game playing, no screwing around with reductions for honestly graded items or \"Missing items\" like companies such as Booksrun are famous.  Payment is prompt.  It is sometimes difficult to  meet their minimum (but far, far easier than D'Clutter, which is near impossible).  However allowing the submitted items a grace period is a HUGE PLUS.   Here  are the three reasons they do not get five stars.  1) The website blows. 2). So does the App.  Both are extremely slow, badly designed and faulty.  If the website does not recognize the ISBN it states you entered the wrong type of item. Yet if you scan with the App, often it will recognize that item. The App might say it is not accepting, yet paste the ISBN into the webpage and it might. 3) No customer service response.  I recently had an item (pre-ISBN) looked up the ISBN and tried to contact EagleSaver.  Wasn't sure they would accept pre-ISBN items.  Three emails over three days and four phone calls (where the answering machine states we will be back to you in 24 hours). No response at all.   Perhaps, it is an operation with limited resources and they cannot upgrade their web and App presence,  maybe they are having trouble retaining adequate staffing.  So I will cut them slack as they have fulfilled everything else with excellence over the past two years."

I am pleased to see these improvements.I give Eagle Saver 4 stars, a composite based on two things.Five stars for item acceptance and price paid.  They pay much better than competing sites, and they refuse very few items.Three stars for service.  Their website says \"You will be paid by PayPal or Check within 1 business day of the receipt of your items.\".  I am currently on my 7th order with them, and I have *never* been paid in a single day.  The fastest has been at least 2 or 3 business days, at best.  As I write this review, I had a package delivered to them 2 business days ago, and it hasn't been paid.  What's more, their site says they are still waiting for it, which is verifiably untrue.  At least other sites acknowledge receiving your package as soon as they get it, and processing follows.  It always keeps me a bit on edge with the way Eagle Saver does it.   But they have always paid."

          "Contenu": "This is my first time using EagleSaver.com to recycle unwanted DVD's. I did a head to head price quote comparison on each DVD with one of EagleSavers competitors. I found Eaglesavers's prices to be higher than their competitors almost every time which was great for me, being the seller. I also noticed that EagleSaver was willing to buy a much larger percent of the DVD's I was selling than their competitor. One thing EagleSaver.com does that I think is great, that their competitor does not do, they identify the DVD by title once the UPC number is put into the system or the barcode is scanned, even if they are not offering a price quote to buy it. There are two areas of the EagleSaver.com process that concerned me and are the reason I did not give them five stars. First, their response to my telephonic, and email inquirer's were well outside of the twenty-four hour window they committed to. Secondly, on a couple of occasions they gave me price quotes on DVD's but when I select \"Add to cart\" I got a message saying \"Please contact support team\", which I did via telephone message and email. The end result was an email from them three days later telling me they were not accepting that DVD. I am not sure why the DVD was not rejected from the beginning like normal for DVD's they are not buying. The shipping process was free, and the post receipt payment process was expedient, both were as advertised."

As I continue to clean out the house, I will likely use them again when I find more movies."
