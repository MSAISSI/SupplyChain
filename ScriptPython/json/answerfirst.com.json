          "Contenu": "The method of taking information for a temporary script change has caused us tremendous grief. It is not followed by every operator, and it is not deleted after the temporary amendment has expired. Also, operators seem \"afraid to think\" for themselves and seem intimidated about being practical. They cling to the script like a poorly programmed Roomba Robot - (hit the wall, back up and keep doing the same scripted thing with total disregard for the result.) They also seem reluctant to transfer to Tier2. This wastes provider time.  Did not follow the protocol for weekend calls to the PA first, Doctor Second and only followed the old temp script to call me first from three or four weeks before. When I argued that I should not be called first, they argued back but did not escalate or offer to call the PA on call. That was the last straw."

I was told it was because I put the call center number on social media or announced it, which I did NOT  do since I when I decide to change companies, I would not have to update our phone number. I also explained we had the service for a month with the number they provided to us and that number had a lot of discarded calls. I am currently researching other companies since it appears that when we do not have a lot of calls coming in it just so happens that numerous \u201cdiscarded\u201d calls come in to increase our bill.

When we redo scripts we are told to put in a ticket, however, it is much easier to explain our needs over the phone directly to a live person who may be able to help us formulate it so it works for all parties.  I have been in contact with someone directly, once, and it was very helpful.  I would like more follow-up such as a phone call to see how the new script is working or even to understand our needs more.  I feel like the drive is to handle everything online or through a ticket, but at least for our situation it requires a better understanding which is why direct communication matters so much.  We work as a \"middle man\" and if problems keep reoccurring our clients will demand that we cancel AnswerFirst service and we definitely don't want that."

There are times the person answering mispronounces the office name (my surname). There are also times the rep seems confused about what they are supposed to say. A recent solicitor was on the line for over 6 minutes and the rep actually put him on hold...we get billed for minutes. Requests and responses are, at times, unclear to the caller. I guess there are always going to be THOSE calls."
