It was impossible for me to specify that myself, and very little about the UI indicated it. I only proceeded when someone in the tech support chat confirmed.- Much of the form seemed like irrelevant questions for a guarantor but I couldn't proceed without answering them.- Several questions demanded information I couldn't provide (e.g. email address for a company that takes emails through an online form and doesn't expose a public email address). I had to dig around the internet to find the closest thing to correct because there was no way to say N/A or provide a note about the exception.- At the end of the form there was a prominent warning telling me I was applying to the place alone, in spite of prior assurance that my application was attached to the actual prospective tenant's. Tech support instructed me to ignore the warning and proceed, which had me quite nervous.- Charging a separate application fee to the guarantor is ridiculous. That should be covered by the main application fee."

If we were to have signed the lease and moved in. I'm very thankful we handed the lease off to my partner's uncle, who is a retired real estate lawyer, who was able to uncover the predatory actions of this rental company. to quote him \"This lease agreement is one of the most aggressive, one-sided, fraudulent documents i have seen in my entire real estate career\". Findigs' practices are shady, underhanded, full of fees to nickel and dime anyone smart enough to avoid the very likely financial ruin that would result from signing a lease with them.If i could give less than one star, i would."

When I finally decided to use this company, I had to move because my current apartment is being renovated. I gave my deposit and other fees. The place was 1350, next thing I knew it was 1395. Next thing I knew was a 450 pet fee with $45 monthly and a 200 admin fee and a 40 a month fee fee.. After a long while I was approved. They sent me a lease via Docu sign. I did not sign it immediately because i wanted to discuss these fees. They sent the lease on the 17th of Nov. I didn't speak to a woman named Karri until the 21st of Nov. She explained to me and the coldest and unfriendly voice that I had no choice but to pay the fees. I was desperate so I agreed  and signed the lease.  A LEGAL DOCUMENT. On the 21st. I was told I had 48 hours after signing the lease. She then told me I had less that 24 hours to pay the deposits and fees by the next day on the 22nd. I informed her that I will try to be there but I normally get paid in the afternoon on a Holiday. The next day came around and I go paid at 3pm. When I called to bring the money. No one answered the phone. Then came Thanksgiving and the black friday. Then I called saturday still no answer. I kinda figured they were on vacation. So comes this monday at 10am. I brought the money to them to continue my moved and was told they cancelled my contract because I missed the one o'clock deadline. I apologize but informed them that I'm here with the money and the lease and the townhouse is available. That I already had my mail cable and electricity transferred. Because I had a signed legal lease. But they refused. I informed them I had the deposit and they closed early and went on break. Mr Karri refused to be one bit sympathetic to my situation. Some customer service. I had already given my current landlord a vacancy notice in 3 days and I have no place to live as of now. These people were callous and cut throat. No compassion and service. I'm sure that if I was a friend or relative, they would've worked with me. But I'm not. To putting and old man in the street. I might have to live and a very cheap hotel until some of rental place have enough time to approval me application. I pray I don't get robbed or hurt. I need legal help!!! And they kept my application fees. Remember their name is REDSAIL PROPERTY. Go somewhere Customer service is horrible in my opinion"

Every time I submitted a document it took days to review and then they would ask for another document - another 2-3 days. Finally after 3 weeks of going back and forth we finally got the approval. I emailed to ask what the process was after our approval and the woman replied that I was not approved even though I got an email that said I was the day before. I had to submit a copy of the email to prove I was indeed approved and the employee responded with \"CONGRATULATIONS. Wait for a call from us.\"I received an email saying that when presented the approved application, the home owner decided to sell the house so it is not available for rent anymore. Complete waste of time and money.They did offer a refund on the application fees but I still got a ding on my credit and of course it's been days and I have not received a response about the refund."

I was notified by email on several occasions of time sensitive information on a chat that was not accessible by my phone, or on my computer.  The chat app. did not open 90% of the time.  I was never able to talk to a real person by phone.  Delayed communication between the chat operator and a third party that was responsible for my lease, resulted in cancellation of my application and loss of the opportunity for the rental. The rental management agency attempted to assist with the short fall in communication, but was unable to break the communication gap.  I would avoid any rental application that uses this app as a qualification step for rentals."

It was difficult getting in touch with anyone at Findigs since the only option is a chat. I was able to get ahold of someone when I opened the chat, but it took the individual over 25 minutes to respond, resulting in an expired chat that kicked me out. I tried a few times to get back in to a chat but it would not connect. I had to reach out to the Property Management company again and tell them I could not get ahold of anyone, so they said they would call. I was able to get back in to a chat later in the day, and was told our applications experienced a \"technical issue\" and that we could not be provided a time when it would resolve. This was very stressful since the Property Management company could not move forward with anything without our reports. A day or so later our reports finally went through and it delayed are ability to get an approval and send our deposit to the Property Management company. Findigs is a great idea, but for something as important and time sensitive as renting a home, there should be more urgency and a better avenue for communication"

There were no options if you did not have what was requested. I was in CA and my dogs shot info was in MI. I called my vet and they never emailed it to me. I did not have it. I was emailed NON stop. I have over 18 emails DEMANDING my dogs shot records. This added to the stress of the move. I felt I was going to lose the perfect rental because of my dogs shot records. Some of the replies were not very nice. I felt harassed. I appreciate the importance of good background information but try to fill out your own form and see how easy it is. For example, it asked for my landlord's email. I have been renting for over 10 years and NEVER had a landlord's email. It would NOT allow me to skip that spot. At the time I was filling out the information in CA, my landlord was fast asleep. I was not going to wake her up for her email address. I just found it very impersonal and frustrating. I can tell you, if I have a choice between two rentals and the one I like better uses this service and the other does not, it could be a deciding factor as to which one I move forward with. Granted, my nerves could be running high, making this move from Michigan to CA. River View was great to work with and the house is lovely. The process was harrowing."

Also, I could not enter any address information from Canada, as there was no \u201ccountry\u201d dropdown or selection ability, but I have a permanent residence address in Canada that my tax information is connected to. Even the US government and my university allow me to input an address from another country as my permanent residence for tax purposes. I know that I am likely in the minority of people who run into this problem on Findigs, but international students, people with work visas, etc, do exist and these issues can be really frustrating. The Findigs system is very easy to use otherwise. They have it streamlined and I was able to fill everything else out quickly. I did appreciate the ability to chat with someone if I needed help.

I could give one of my Pensions, but Social Security doesn\u2019t list the U.S. Gov as a business.  I also give piano lessons as a part time business, but there was not a place to add that without a business name & license.*The rest of the app was fine, but I spent a LONG time trying different approaches to give my income & only had my one pension as a total income listed in the end.I guess it ended up OK, but the financial section didn\u2019t fit my profile well.  I would have gone into the office, but I live in the Detroit area."

If they could have an additional adult button within the one application that would be so much easier. I understand the landlord needing to know about all the adults in the house but it was hard for me to manage 3 applications. My wife isn't good with computers especially uploading documents. It was also confusing that our information was sent to the landlord for them to approve or not approve. It took me a while to understand the chat feature to upload more information. I was lucky that their was someone I could text on the leasing officer side to tell me to upload in the chat. I think that over all it was a pretty decent way to apply and to get the documents. Thank you for asking for feedback"

Also the notifications each time an applicant finished a given portion of the application were very useful. Our main reason for 3 stars rather than 5 was a lack of communication combined with significantly delayed responses. I had to call the office multiple times, each time I was given a timeframe of 24-48hrs in which a decision would be made, and each time we waited 3-5 days. This delayed our move in significantly which is quite stressful when trying to coordinate moving out of one place and into the other, and resulted in not being able to schedule movers due to the short timeframe and proximity to the end of the month. In the timeframe between applying and our first response, we were approved for and gave up another property. This does not seem to be the norm given the other reviews we saw, so I\u2019m not sure what the cause of this was.  That being said, everyone in the office was very helpful and courteous, and calling was never much of a hassle, also we did finally get approved and moved in."

There was three weeks ( which we understand is a short period of time) between the time of our move. We got all of our information in the same day we found a place we liked, but no one responded for about 3 1/2 days later to say we needed extra info. We uploaded that information within 24 hrs and still didn't get a response for another 2 days. Once we got a response,  the house we applied for was taken, we were instructed to choose another home and it wouldn't take but about 2-3 days to hear back. We choose another home from the site, and We didn't hear anything for 4 days saying, that house we selected was taken as well.  In the meantime my family is already on the move to head to our new state in hopes we'd have something within a few days, but no message or call or any updates until the third day of our hotel stay. By then we had already signed a lease from another company with a sure move in date. We had to pay the $75 per adult,  just to get the run around for three whole weeks, it's sad that you guys are charging people this fee, knowing that you're going to drag your feet and let as many people apply, just to keep saying the house is taken. At least offer a portion of the people's application fee back, it's ridiculous."

With a $400 cleaning fee, the cleaners did a quick half hazard job with crums under the kitchen cabinets, dirty counter tops, etc...   The worst was the outside patios.   They were not swept or hosed down at all and lots of cob webs.  We did contact property management and they did send a cleaning crew out right away.  The home could use some patio furniture for the downstairs patios and additional chairs for the upstairs patio.  In a perfect world, they would have a small high top table with high chairs which would be great for enjoying the nightly sunset...    Also, there is no BBQ.  Lastly, the plants and flower beds are really bad and totally neglected.   But, once again, management came through and allowed their handy man (Warren) to come in and trim dead shrubs and lay down mulch.  Warren went over and above to make things right."
