          "Contenu": "Signed up for software in October 2020.  Cost $49.50 with a discount.  No mention of auto renew taking money from by debit card, or I wouldn't have signed up. Billed $27.80 in December 2021. No email warning to tell me that I had auto renewed.  Such a small amount I didn't even notice it coming off my debit card. Billed $179 in December 2022 from my debit card. No email reminder or warning. Just noticed. Excruciatingly difficult to turn auto-renew off on the website.  Keep sending you round in circles if you want to cancel.  Beware.Further to PC Protects comments below, going to the the 'Disable auto renew' section gives three options.  Regardless of the option chosen they just send you back into the classic loop of not wanting to lose your business and making it unbelievably difficult to simply cancel auto renew.  If you select 'Pricing issue'  you get 'We're sorry to hear you have a concern with the price of your PCProtect subscription, and we'd really hate to see you leave, running the risk of being unprotected from harmful threats online. If you really want to cancel your account and risk being unprotected from online threats you can do so in your account, or you can continue below by clicking next.'  There is no 'next' button on the page.  The other 2 options are in a similar vein. Even when you follow the  'my account' link (which is the only place it appears on their website,) and you are able to disable autorenew, they STILL KEEP YOUR DEBIT CARD DETAILS on your account screen even though my account is paid up for the next 11 months and I don't want to renew.  Now I'm going to have to go through the hassle of cancelling that debit card to make sure they don't take any more payments.  Once again. Beware."

          "Contenu": "Update.. useless live support or emailing because all they do is reply with an already generated reply.  These customer service people aren't human or won't behave like humans. They won't or can't reply using their brains... So they hide behind their emails. I have requested over 15 times for a manager to contact me directly... Yet nothing, same pathetic auto generated replies... The request is ignored!! And what makes it worse even know I have been assured over and over everything is cancelled they tried to take my money again... OMG they are liars that steal your money.. luckily my credit card expired..So don't direct me on here what to do cause your staff are hopeless, have a manager contact me and sort this out once and for all. You owe me $99. You're an IT virus protection company I'm sure you can look back at your emails... Cause you'll see YOU stuffed up and actually legally have to refund me. But instead you make it impossible to talk to a real person with a working brain who can speak for themselves and actually helpMy first review, again you didn't even realise what the issue was.. It's not the amount of money, it's that I cancelled, email and told your company to cancel and stop the auto renewal.. But that didn't work... You never cancelled it or stopped the auto renewal..i uninstalled it.. Did everything right.. But you still charged me again.. Your stuff up.. So what you tell you customers to do... Didn't work.. You still charged me... Now refusing to refund me...Their software might be fine.. But they're customer service is terrible..I have sent over 30 emails this time and maybe 20 last time with issues..Product worked but after having log on issues..I emailed, they replied and I replied back only to get a different customer service rep.. So basically repeating yourself over and over again.. Often just getting an auto-generated reply.. so in the end I cancelled, said no more. I'm not using the product don't renew this. Stop the automatic renewal and don't charge me... Advised all done and very apologetic... Then.. I'm charged again.. Again email and email, they say yes they will refund me etc.. then I get another email saying click on the link to stop the renewal.. I email again.. Hello..I cancelled cause I can't log on.. You already told me it's stopped..I can't log on.. So link doesn't work.. I get on with my life.. Until I get another email a year later ( last month) saying they will take next year's amount out... So nothing was cancelled, stopped.. Nothing..I check and realise they never refunded me ( stupidly, I took their word ) so now the battle continues... I have been told by many different staff that yes auto renewal stopped..mmm also got sent that link again.. told because I didn't use the link they took back my refund... Even know I've explained over and over.. Can't log on.. Sending me a link to do so.. Useless... Have asked for 1 person to take ownership and handle this.. Look back at last year's emails etc.. asked for a manager or team leader to contact me... Nothing, no one.. Just the same stupid auto general replies.. I used language and then they replied themselves.. Lol.. so they are real.. Just pathetic at their jobs..Absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced.. staff stuffed up, didn't do their job correctly, and advised me they had!  and I was changed because of this.. and now they are refusing to refund me.. Even know they said they would as they shouldn't have charged me in the first place..."

Then when you try and download it is a minefield of optional extras which all cost more. After more than 6 hours of unsuccessfully attempting to download supposedly with the help of customer service I gave up and requested my money back as per their site. Cue another battle with customer service who really did not want to do that. A definite case of buyer beware."

July was my first inquiry to PCProctet, the case is not yet closed 12 September."

So I cancelled the subscription... but instead of complying with my wish I got sent more offers and incentives by their customer service agents. Even VIP offers or Roll-ups to other, more expensive products.... And their (German) language of the service was simply a bad joke. You get better results from using ANY free translator from the web (e.g. Google or Deepl).In the end I had to write 3 Emails to finally receive a confirmation of my cancellation - which were always answered with more marketing offers in bad language. Sadly I can not recommend this company.EDIT: In the cancellation process you have to verify your translation after denying 2 more pop-up offers by typing your registered Email address and Pasword while EVERY FEW SECONDS another poop-up with their \"very cheapest offer\" pops-up (So if you want to get the best value-for-money, you might want to do that, but I would personally not recommend using a company with such aggressive marketing)"

That confirmation was never confirmed (although I have written email to confirm with ALL details) or activated, and I forget about it, until I noticed another monthly $8.99 fee on my bank account.I spoke with pcprotect last week, and they promised to return the last fee, which they just did - and then they freaking billed me $8.99 AGAIN!!! All the other months they had to get management approvel to refund - still haven't heard anything back on that ....In total I have now paid $89.99 for their service, which I've never used, and only talked with an ignorant guy in their customer department, who seemed like he couldn't care less. I love and have recommended A LOT of different services and companies - now I've tried giving a bad review too. But it's completely deserved, and I cannot recommend using pcprotect at all although they probably have a decent product.@PCPROTECT: Feel free to reach out to me directly if anything"

I reached the conclusion that cutting my losses was preferable to letting things run. Two weeks ago they send me renewal details adding that \u00a3142 would be taken from my account next month. I immediately contacted them saying I'd left and under no circumstances were they to try and remove  funds from my account otherwise it will be theft. There reply amazed me as I had written 12 months ago advising them of cancellation I was told that unless I completed their cancellation system I would still be classed as having been a member. Eventually a further email is received that shows the true nature of this company. The email had a link for you to follow, that opened a further page that continually swapped between leave and remain. The remain button, as I inadvertently found out sets off a celebratory message saying stuff like 'Great you are staying' and other such crap. The leave button required your password confirming your decision. As  I had stripped my machine of all mention of this lot I had to try and find my password. I should point out that I suffer with a nerve problem akin to Parkinsonism but thank God it is not quite that bad. In my rush to shed myself of this crap business I pressed the wrong button. Why didn't I need a password to remain, why do they ignore everything that has gone before and why have they yet to reply to my communications. My message to this shower is simple, you've been fired, you are not wanted and in my world you are a bunch of charlatans feigning respectability.If they decide to dip into my PayPal account I'll let you know."

          "Contenu": "This company is unscrupulous, devious and untrustworthy.  Their customer services people consistently ignore your questions & requests and they appear to be clueless when it comes to managing a technical problem through to resolution.   My system failed recently leaving me without the internet security & virus protection I had paid for.  I initially contacted the company\u2019s Chat Support line for help, but after 3 days and numerous product uninstall/reinstall procedures (at their request) it became apparent that they were no closer to a solution, so I asked that the issue be escalated.Their 'Technical Supervisors' group eventually replied and for the next 8 days they did nothing but return inept suggestions & responses, showed no urgency whatsoever and no willingness to (attempt to) isolate or circumvent the problem in order to get me back online - and they tried to blame my system/Windows for the problem!   Finally, after 13 days, I decided to call their UK number in order to raise a complaint and no sooner had I completed the call than an email popped up outlining a solution to the problem!   So, they wasted my time, 'fobbed me off' for almost two weeks, were clueless as to how to tackle the problem and they obviously knew about it all along - and they do not have a complaints procedure! I have an audit trail of exchanged emails to support all of the above.The company also operate a scandalous subscription renewal practice which defaults to 'auto-renew' at registration time (if there's a choice it is very well hidden!) and when a reminder email is sent 30-days prior to term expiry they sneakily do not mention the renewal cost!If you do not cancel before term end you are charged a scandalous amount for renewal - probably four times what you paid for the first year's cover.  Whether this practice is legal or not is one thing, but there's no doubt in my mind that it is unscrupulous and IMO has no place if a company genuinely wishes to operate in a fair and decent manner. I paid \u00a329.94 for the first year and discovered that the renewal cost would have been \u00a3119.70. Please be aware that this company market both the Total AV and PC Protect products, but the customer support services are effectively managed by the same people/organisation within the parent company (SS Protect Limited).   Just check the Terms of Service for each product website."

I even went so far as to get the Identity Protection Plan and it helped me locate an ex wife that means harm and make sure that MY DATA was protected and that I was doing the necessary things to keep HER out of mine and my family's life.  Well, it came time to check up on the ID Protection.  Consistently now, I get and error message when connecting.  I e-mailed support.  I spend all day on the phone so I won't call.  I heard back only to provide what was asked for in the way of exact messages and screen shots and have heard NOTHING.  Absolutely NOTHING.  I'll give you the protection of the PC part of what your software does.  But I won't vouch for your ID Protection piece because you won't respond to my e-mail messages.  Let's just say I'm a bit disappointed and I will be seeking other protection when the time comes and that will be very soon."

The second one allowed me access to my task manager. The app that was using the most power was Google. I was able to close that app in the task manager & that fixed it. This app seems to have more features. I am hoping that using a different browser and this app can do the trick!"

All done with a Representative ON LINE, helpful  because  my hearing is not good.  The patience shown to me is worth a Gold Medal.  I am, as I told Mr. Reynolds, who assisted me, VERY GRATEFUL for the understanding shown to me several times over.  I  am so  glad I  found these folks.
