I have had my sites with them for almost two years; recently, I decided to move my domains and host from them after I needed help getting proper tech support, which they failed to give.. they basically have no tech support at all, which is super frustrating... But I have a balance of $36 in my account, so I contacted support to ask to get the credit back since I'm no longer going to need it because I'm moving my services, but they wrote that they do not refund the balance because this is their \"policy\"... Their policy = steal client money!I strongly advise you to stay away from Namecheap company, and if you are already a client, make sure not to use a \"top-up\" balance because this money will be taken by this fraud company in case you decide to leave them!"

They repeatedly made me wait and switched agents, and it took a long time to get them to reveal if the domains could still be renewed.I may have to move all of my domains to a different registrar. Reliable automatic renewals are vital to me because I don't want to worry about losing my domains."

During last years I received hundreds spam, phishing and scam from criminals using their hosting which are using temporary adresses and e-mails. Due to that many of them didn't go to my spambox. Namecheap did nothing for that matter. I hope their office goes up in flames along with their servers. Such a frivolous, criminal supporting company should not exist.On imgur (image upload service) I uploaded latest reports for these \"thieves\", but there were more e-mails and reports in the past. I cannot paste a link on Trustpilot, so you can open Imgur and add it to path: a/oNUgc1USent domains, e-mail .eml files (headers + body). Nothing. Only money, money, money. From criminal activity. This is best money for them. If you are criminal, it's hosting for you. They won't ban you until you pay them money."

Why did I spend almost an hour online to not receive any real help. The namecheap reps are getting lazier and less helpful every second. They need to fire them and hire people that actually want to work. This low quality experience happened with a rep named Vitalii Panchenko just now. As much as namecheap is affordable it's low quality customer service isn't worth the headache.Update the shift leader of the managed WordPress department Bohdan Lysnik contacted me but he was basically excusing the terrible customer service representative behavior and also lied as well. So basically most of namecheap's customer service representative are low quality. Ticket number BAF-512-29115"

Add some C-NAME or TXT record in Domain DNS.2. Add some script in the website header section.3. Provide any authorization code send to either at the old email or at the domain admin email i.e. admin @fodret.com4. Publish some specific page with code on website.I will be grateful to the namecheap support if they help me to recover my account. Thankyou.P.S. It is my 2nd review on TrustPilot as there is no significant action taken on the 1st review."

Website setup on domain at Ionos Hosting 4. DNS of domain at Ionos hosting.5. Google Search Console Ownership 6. WordPress on domain ownership Then I have:1. Created user at wordpress and provided the details of that to namecheap support for verification2. Contacted the Namecheap support by email of domain (admin @fodret.com which clearly reflects my ownership over domain.Still after all these details and offering them to check everything via anydesk, they stubbornly rejected my claims and refused to revert the email change in my namecheap account. They only keep on asking the namecheap account name which is dont remember unfortunately but i have told them that the username is FODRET . They didn't help me like the whole process depends upon the namecheap account name. I have initiated the ticket at ICANN ORG to seek any help from the, meanwhile i would recommend everyone not to register domains here as the support of namecheap is really CHEAP, calling its customers fraud and theives.At last, I would request NameCheap support again that consider the proofs that I am providing you among which top of the list is the email from which i am contacting you, that is admin @fodret.com. Please verify me some other way like: a. Sending some authorization code to the old email jackmaren1 @gmail.com. b. Ask me to prove ownership of domain like Google asks (adding some txt or cname records in Domain DNS)c. Ask me to make any custom email of domain like abc @fodret.com and namecheap send any authozation code to it.d. Ask me to add any code in Website Fodret .com header section.e.

After weeks of waiting, I only received dismissive responses. This is no way to treat customers.update:This is utterly absurd and a waste of my time, dealing with automated responses lacking any real understanding. My website is a Forex affiliate service catering to Persian-speaking individuals outside Iran. No Iranian can even hold an account with the brokers I feature unless they are outside Iran and have an identity from another country.You haven't even taken the time to properly review my site's content, as I repeatedly asked for specifics regarding the supposed problematic content, and you have consistently evaded this request.I will not be silenced by this baseless and unjust treatment. I have found others who have faced similar issues, and I am organizing a campaign to bring widespread attention to this matter.

Renewal costs more than registration, but you will find out only after you register. Bad business practice and immoral.

But if you put it in a pot filled with pleasantly tepid water and gradually heat it up, the frog will remain in the water until it boils to death.That's pretty much what became of Namecheap's business model.When I moved my domain portfolio to Namecheap years ago, they were fairly competitive, but then, bit by bit, another price increase, and another, sometimes bare months apart. Now, they are a massive 150% more expensive than the competition, and it's time to say goodbye.It seems that they've also outsourced their customer service to India/Pakistan (whether partially or fully, I am not sure), which only adds insult to injury. It's amazing what greed does..."

My website was constantly slow, and downtime was a frequent occurrence. It's embarrassing when your visitors can't even access your site. The user interface was also clunky and difficult to navigate, making simple tasks feel like a chore.To top it all off, their pricing was misleading. What they advertise as a low-cost solution quickly racks up hidden fees, leaving you feeling cheated. I ended up moving my website to a different provider, and I couldn't be happier with the improved performance and customer support.Save yourself the frustration and don't waste your money on Namecheap.

Extremely frustrating, be warned, if you get marked for abuse make sure your contact email in Name cheap isn't your company domain."

          "Contenu": "After hearing great reviews of the Namecheap Stellar shared hosting I decided to give it a try on my different sites. Overall everything seemed fantastic for the first few days, until I decided to enable the Litespeed (LS) CDN network on my websites. From previous experience, when LS CDN is optimized loading is lightning fast, so why not use it here? As all Namecheap servers run off LS servers I figured connecting to their CDN servers would be a simple and beautifully efficient process. Unfortunately that turned out to be a wildly optimistic take. Upon enabling the CDN I started getting cascading 520 errors saying (browser couldn't reach the origin server). Upon reading the documentation, I saw they recommended whitelisting several dozen IP addresses used to process CDN requests. At first, I found it strange that these IP's weren't already whitelisted as they are required to fully utilize LS server capabilities. No problem, I thought, will just contact support and get this worked out quickly. Nope, this simply started a process of dozens of messages between myself, LS techs, and Namecheap techs. After several weeks, it was determined that Namecheap was unwilling to make any changes to solve this problem. They stated that upgrading to a VPS ($$$) was the only possible way to whitelist the CDN IP\u2019s and thus fully utilize the servers. Ultimately this means that a decent percentage of server performance is completely unavailable to shared host users. Of course, you can also just pay a third party CDN provider extra money each month for something that is already included at the Enterprise level by default for just using their LS servers.After a bit of research it was discovered that Namecheap offers an in-house SuperSonic CDN. Learning this made it abundantly clear that by handicapping the LS CDN, it easily funnels many new and inexperienced users into purchasing their add-on service. To be fair, I understand this from a sales perspective. I would hope though for future users they make it abundantly clear at sign-up that their shared servers are completely incompatible with LS's CDN service. This would seemingly save many frustrated customers from even signing up in the first place if they are searching from companies that utilize LS servers and their performance."

Clear is, that you like to make it for your clients as difficult as possible to proper transfer their domains away from you. Having all important information hidden and not clearly communicated.... such as the recommendation to switch off the privacy service!

I just let them hold the domain and forwarded it to another hosting provider that does setup the SSL certificate for free. I've used Namecheap for years and my previous purchase in May 2022 it was advertised the same and they did setup the SSL certificate for that purchase. Bottom line-- if you're looking for an easy way to setup a wordpress site and get up and running quickly go somewhere else."

Also, FTP doesn't work, every time the login details fail. And following their copious amounts of documentation to do the most basic of tasks is painful.But the most frustrating part of their service is dealing with their tech support. They will often jump from one assistant to another without warning and assistants are not processing what has already been explained and so often one may have to go over the same details multiple times.I think the problem with namecheap like any large hosting provider is they get complacent and think they can throw a call centre when they struggle to service their customers. Unfortunately, this leads to subpar service which is time consuming to deal with and is off putting.I think it's time to find a new host although I'm wondering if going back to hosting my own servers may be less headache-inducing. Even though it is more work at least I'm in control.I can't really recommend namecheap any more."

They asked me to provide the last four digits and expiration date of the credit card I used 3 years ago to pay for my domain. When I wasn't able to provide that information (go figure), I was told I needed to verify using veriff.com. A site that has you upload a government issued ID and a selfie. A quick Google search shows it is based in Estonia and has a 1.9 rating on TrustPilot. Need I say more. NameCheap lives up to its name of being cheap, but it sucks the moment you have an issue.Update based on final outcome:In the vein of being fair, I am updating my review after considerable (no joke about 12 rounds) back and forth with NameCheap. It took a pretty strong threat involving advice from an attorney, but I was able to get them to verify my identity by providing a utility bill as opposed to using veriff.com. If they read this, I would advise they stop advertising that PCI compliance keeps my data safe because it does no such thing. PCI compliance only serves the purpose of protecting a credit card number, and it is a self-regulated organization set up by credit card companies.I do commend the organization for quick responses, but it is clear most of those responding only have the authority to copy and paste templated sentences. They repeatedly ignored my requests to be transferred to a supervisor. I am hoping not to repeat this process, but I would recommend asking to be transferred to Risk Management as quickly as possible. My issue was resolved in one round of communication with that department."

I did log in to make sure the card on file did indeed expire and it did. So I left it. However I was still charged. When I went to dispute it I was informed that it was more than 120 hours (5 days) after they charged the account so they couldn't refund it. This was on day 6. They said they charged the expired card and the bank sent them the updated card information and still charged my account. If someone from the company actually reads these then you should improve this process. The email sent clearly stated it could not renew the account. No where in the email did it say it was possible that they could indeed still charge the account. While I was chatting with customer service I was sent a link to an article apparently on their website stating that they could. That also should have been linked in the email. How am I supposed to know to look for these things before I even have a problem? They got 2 stars because the customer service people were nice or at least seemed to be and this is also a bank issue. Otherwise they would have gotten 1. Will take it up with my bank tomorrow (Monday)."

          "Contenu": "I've used namecheap for domain registration for more than 13 years. Both stars are for the registration service, they've been fine for that and for years I recommended them to people. I deeply regret the recommendations after switching my shared website hosting to them and seeing how they try to exploit technical ignorance.Every web host in the same price range offers free SSL - a security certificate to enable greater trust on the internet. Every host offers it free because they also get it free, using a tool called \"let's encrypt\". Namecheap do not offer free SSL. They pretend they do for 1 year, then they plan to charge ~$12 each for certificate they've \"given\" you for the first year. Depending on your domain setup, this could be up to 50 additional $12 charges after the first year ($600+). Not very honest! I saw that the SSL was not free prior to signup, so I asked a sales rep to confirm I'd be able to use let's encrypt (the free service every other host provides). I was told I could use it, so I signed up.My certificates were expiring ~50 days into my time with namecheap, so I set about installing let's encrypt. It should be very straightforward: run a script, then click a button saying you want SSL. Namecheap do not allow users of their shared hosting to execute that script. Fair enough as it's theoretically a security risk so surely a support agent will execute it for me instead, it'll only take a second or two. The support agent will not execute the script on my behalf. Instead they spend ~45 minutes on chat with me telling me to either use the \"free\" 1 year one (for the renewal I suppose) or telling me they can cancel my account but maybe no refund because I'm outside the 30 day window, or I can manually create and upload certificates myself.This is frustrating because it would be trivial for the agent to solve my issue (literal seconds, unless their systems are terrible). I thought the \"cheap\" in the name was their price, not the way they try to screw every penny out of users.Anyway, I'm kind of technical and I'm annoyed so I decide I'll manually generate certificates and upload them to last until I've used up my hosting and can move to a good web host who'll include free SSL like you'd expect. Here's another gross surprise: to manually generate a certificate, you need to prove it's your website - a sensible safety precaution. To prove you own the website you need to add a special code to the DNS record (a thing that tells the internet where your website lives). Namecheap disable the ability to add records to the DNS if they start with an underscore: \"_\". What a coincidence that the free SSL tool generates special codes that all start with an underscore!In summary: through greediness, laziness, or a combination, namecheap do not allow shared hosting customers to access the free SSL that most of the internet relies on to keep websites safe. Instead they try to trick/nickel and dime their customers, and appear to actively block/disable more technical users from accessing free SSL.Consequently as a long-time customer, I have to strongly recommend you avoid namecheap for web hosting, and also now consider that another domain registrar is probably a safer bet too."

          "Contenu": "I'll have to give 2 stars for the fact that domain management has been easy, especially relating to managing domains for clients.However, Namecheap seems to use cheap scamming tactics to get money from their clients. When you look at your domains in the domain list and see e.g. that a domain gets renewed on the 8th of November, they actually charge you ONE MONTH prior to that, without any kind of information in the dashboard. They tell you it's marked somewhere in the renewal email notice, but seriously, who reads all the tiny prints sent to you?They explain this behavior due to the fact that domains need to be renewed before the real renewal, but this is not shown clearly anywhere in the domain view, so no ordinary client will understand this until it's too late.So either very unprofessional and misleading UX in the client dashboard, or an intentional strategy to feed early on the clients."

To clarify, I'm talking about a very simple STATIC site (no php or whatsoever, just pure html, js and css). The site usually takes over 60 seconds (!!!!) to load. I didn't believe it, so I made speed tests at Pingdom and GTmetrix targeting different locations around the world: the results were the same or even worse (sometimes 70-80sec to load). Hilarious."

Later on, I encountered issues with users from Hotmail not receiving emails from us and that was my main source of frustration for a long time. Support told us that they are looking into the issue and I had waited for 1 - 2 weeks for them to resolve that. Needless to say, I've lost users over this time and had to resort to using another service for transactional emails. While I'm still on the service, I no longer depend on it for the transactional emails. I hope that Namecheap can improve from here and provide a more reliable service for its users."

The need to contact support repeatedly, often as frequently as once or twice a month, can be quite disappointing and frustrating.Considering this, it might be a wise decision to switch your hosting plan to Hostinger. Hostinger offers a more reliable hosting experience that can help alleviate the frustrations you've encountered with Namecheap. This transition could bring you the hosting stability and support you need to ensure a smoother online presence."

After a month I saw that I was charged 9.99$ + 18.99$ for these two services!!Long story short, I asked them to cancel the charge and they refused!An honest company would at least send a single reminder saying \"Hey we saw you were not using your X,Y....\"But it's better to keep it hidden as your money is more important than you!(UPDATE) after contacting their support for the second time they've decided to refund me for the two services which I never used.I updated my review to 3 stars based on that solution. But be aware that the current system is still no ethical and should be changed from the ground up. Thank you Iryna"

Update: They contacted me via email and told me it's a bug and that doiman it's not actually available for registration since 2004. So I was wrong but only because I did not know such bugs would exist in their service. Or anywehre else. So a taken domain appears to be free for registration on Namecheap. That's it."

This slows down my roll.  The assumption with Namecheap is that you know what the best choices of tools are.  C-Panel is amazing, and what you have added to it is probably great, but there are TOO MANY choices.  I never know if any of the options cost additional monies, much less what pieces work well together and what do not work together.  I need more help desk help.  If you are going to offer all of these tools, it is hard for me to believe that I am alone in this situation."

So you think of an unmemorable password just to get in (this right here is why no one can remember their passwords).

They do not make refunds only suggest transferring domains to another registrar (that is not free).This is a quote from an email I got from their support:\"Term of Agreement; Modification... If You have purchased Services from Namecheap, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect, including any changes made to this Agreement, as long as You take advantage of and use the Services.\"This I read as: we can change the terms of service as we want at any moment of time and we don't care about your business.

They've never let me or my clientele down from pricing to the tools they offer.However, I'd advise sticking to them primarily for domain needs. I'm a tad sceptical about their other offerings, and some critiques here seem to underline that sentiment. But when it comes to domain registration? They're top-notch."

Unlike other host providers, integration with Django framework was easy and they provide support with their very active and effective live chat when you encounter problems along the way with django and mysql database integration. The support employees are really cooperative as well as patient when working with problems you are encountering for example, installing of libraries/modules for your django webapp. I am giving them a rating of 4 and not 5 because I believe there is room for improvement. For example, I would want them to make integration POSTGRESQL database more easier and visible, because of recent when i tried to use POSTGRESQL as database for my project, my attempts were futile even though I had tried to make research on doing so. But over all, the pros outweigh the cons for me by far as of my usecase for now."

          "Contenu": "UPDATE: I heard from a supervisor at Namecheap and they apologized and gave me a small credit. So I upgraded my review to 4 stars. I am still under the impression that I probably won't be able to cancel a domain in the future. As far as I know, this isn't an issue with other domain providers. Otherwise, Namecheap is pretty good. The prices are low and there are a lot of different services and options. I do see room for improvement in the customer service area but this is true of most businesses now. ORIGINAL REVIEW: On May 7 I bought 2 new domains for my blog and podcast. As it turned out there were problems with each of the domains. Since I was well within the 5 day grace period, I contacted customer service on May 8th to cancel. I had to get up early the next morning so I didn't appreciate being kept on chat for almost an hour (multiple very long holds). I also REALLY didn't appreciate being accused of domain sampling (which I had never even heard of before). While I was waiting (and waiting) for the customer service person to rejoin the chat, I looked up domain sampling. I now understand that it is a form of fraud that usually involves using the entire 5 day grace period for nefarious purposes. I had these domains for 1 day.I have several domains and WordPress hosting through Namecheap. I don't ask to be treated like a valued customer. But being treated like a customer in the most basic sense - instead of a criminal - would have been nice.I have not found customer service helpful with issues with WordPress either."

The currency rate from dollar to naira (Nigeria currency) Is more affordable and with the best service compared to other hosting companies.If you are new here and a beginner looking for the best hosting company to start with then try Namecheap."

However I flipped the 1 star to 5 stars because the service from live chat to reset me back again was astonishing. I am of age and not an IT BUFF. The agents spent five hours patiently with me and got me to where I needed to be. When you read the 1 star reviews from others you have to understand that emotions play massively. But please don't knock all the staff on the back of your mishap. .thank you again."
