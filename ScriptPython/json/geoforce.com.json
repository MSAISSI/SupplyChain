I had quite a time finally getting an answer that I could e-transfer the payment. No body has followed up to see if we are liking the product and if we are having any issues. This in my opinion is TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. Nobody has sent an email letting me know. the status of Canadian ELD compliance? Very very disappointed. At this point I can not recommend this company and I almost hope that it doesn't get certified so my contract is void."

          "Contenu": "What's the difference between Geoforce Customer Service and a unicorn? Neither exist.  This is by far the worst customer experience I have ever experienced. 10/10 would not recommend. The only person pleasant to deal with was Christine; she actually did what she said she would do and was always polite.Now, what exactly went wrong? The better question is what went right, as that\u2019ll be a much shorter list. When we brought up our concerns and reasons we needed to clean up our account, we were faced with nothing but attitude (and the most \"we don't give two sh*ts\" attitude). We were told that we were costing the company money, and that if we switch our monthly term they would risk losing us a client. Account clean up took well over a year and a half, due to at least a month long wait in between responses even though we sent a weekly follow up email that was consistently ignored by their team members.  The few occasions that we did hear back, it would take multiple additional weeks for a legitimate response; responses only provided after continuous follow-ups from our admins. The only time there was a prompt response was when they might make a sale. To this day, we are still experiencing billing issues. \u201cSell it and forget about it\u201d should be their company slogan. Not once have we ever been asked how we are liking the program (Trakopolis and Geotab), unless it was an auto email review response; we have always been the ones to reach out. No one has ever asked if there are things we didn't like, how to improve or just a genuine check in on our company.Between the lack of customer service, rude responses, lack of follow-up and blatant indifference to our plights, I have never been more frustrated dealing with 2 people than I have been with them. Neither of them are proficient at problem solving (or even listening) in any way. Although we do not have an extremely large company, we are still paying a significant amount (thousands monthly) of the devices, software system and support. We should be treated with the same decency as any large company. If they do not have the capacity to do this, all contracts with smaller companies should be void. While I was dealing with cleaning everything up I had my email get blocked for multiple months. Multiple emails back and forth with IT on both sides and the only thing that could be detected was a block."

We are stuck since we have so much money invested in the devices.  However, the functionality of Geoforce compared to Worldview is different enough that we would look for another provider if it were not so expensive to do so.The customer service provided by Geoforce is also lacking.
