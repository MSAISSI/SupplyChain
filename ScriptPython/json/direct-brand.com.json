I emailed and asked if I could receive a refund on the shipping cost since I paid for 2-day shipping and ordered early enough for it to be shipped same day, but it was not, and I have not received any communication back."

          "Contenu": "It was impossible to contact anyone by phone... none of the options either picked up or returned my messages. Therefore my husband was unable to determine if the fan we ordered would fit the way he thought it would. We purchased it based on the limited information on the website. AFTER we returned it, I received an email letting me know that that fan would not work in an Enviro stove.  Iwas told I could return it, but I would be out the cost of shipping. I was given no return instructions or return label, so I simply sent it to the return address on the box.  As of yet I  have not heard that you've received it.  That was a crummy experience costing me time, frustration, and forty dollars!"

I ordered 2 room blowers and an exhaust blower that matched up perfectly to my 3 King pellet stoves. They sent to me an incorrect room blower from what I ordered. I called the phone number given and left many messages but nobody ever called me back. I got through to them by the e-mail I found on the BBB website, they then promptly e-mailed me back. They then sent me the correct part and covered all charges for sending back the incorrect part. Some may say not to give 5 stars due to this however working in retail most my life I know accidents do happen and they fixed the problem and even refunded the UPS charges back to me of which I paid for the initial order. So folks please lighten up, I know I will be ordering from them again and know that if a situation arises they will take care of the problem."
