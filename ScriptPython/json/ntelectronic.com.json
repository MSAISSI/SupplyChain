          "Contenu": "I purchased a NETGEAR Orbi mesh wireless router for my home in 2020.  I paid >$300.  It worked great until I recently moved to a new home.  I was unable to set it up at the new address.  I called tech support and they told me I needed to purchase a new software license for it for $300.  If they had been honest with me during the initial purchase I would not be feel so cheated.  Hiding the software license information in the 10 pages of fine print of the \u201cTerms and conditions \u201c is not a honest way of doing business.  I will never again trust this manufacturer."

Then 1 in stock after my purchase. A shipping label with FedEx was created 2 days later. System seems to update in real-time. Also, why notify FedEx if you didn't have it. Only positive is they said they are issuing a full refund. I'd avoid this place.I'm hoping to be able to change this rating. Expected date on my package was Feb 2. It's Feb 2 and FedEx still doesn't have my package. I sent an email on Feb 1 asking about my item. I have not heard back yet. If customer service changes, I will possibly change my review."

With a fake paypal screenshot showing a \"refund\". They said to give it 1-3 days. Surprise surprise 8 days later there is nothing there. Paypal said that screenshot is completely bogus. Do NOT buy from this place. Do NOT trust the \"favorable\" reviews. That was my first mistake. Another update. This seller keeps blaming PayPal for the problem of my refund. I did NOT use PayPal. PayPal told me there is NO record of this transaction. Also, that they only refund money used to purchase through PayPal. I was instructed to contact my card holder and report NT ELECTRONICS as fraud. My bank was already aware of my problem. I just informed them of my conversation with PayPal. They have now escalated this to a fraud investigation. I really have to question the positive reviews about this company. Hopefully I am just a single incident. NT Electronics has gone silent now and won't respond to my emails. They never answer the phone. Very suspicious company. As I mentioned in my previous review. I was told I would be given a full refund. Since they didn't have the item. That was Tuesday January 31. Ten days later I have yet to get my refund. I've had to contact my bank and open a claim. Beware they know how to take your money. But don't know how to refund it."

The controller I received is essentially unusable and was likely a broken item that was returned, never refurbished and simply resold. Feel free to take the risk like I did, but just know that even at a decent discount you may come out losing money."

The Chromebook is clean, as much as it is open box, and it was very easy to set up my account. I am also very pleased with the screen size and the prize. Most Chromebooks I came across had screen sizes of only 11 inches for the price I was looking for, so this was a super deal. I will definitely be purchasing from NT Electronics again, should the need arise."

And its three weeks to Christmas!!! Today I have been given a full refund! All issues with FedX have been dealt with by NT staff. I thought I'd still be dealing with this on the 4th of July!

I had been looking for an Android tablet for my wife and was unhappy with the price of the new Tab S7 and the lower grade specs on the Tab S6 lite, so I was looking for an original Tab S6.  Most of what I found was used or \"renewed\", but NT had the bundle with the S pen and keyboard I was looking for, new.  It was open box, but that was fine, and the price was hundreds of dollars lower than the Tab S7.  I ordered it on a Thursday night, and NT shipped it out via Fedex at no charge the next day.  Their website was easy to navigate, the check out process was quick, and their communications were top notch.  The package arrived fine, and included everything that was promised, all working fine.  5 stars to NT!  I will definitely check their site when I have other electronics purchases to make."

A couple of them made me hesitant to order. Then I said a prayer and ordered. I'm glad I did because it arrived in 4 days and everything was as described. If  the box had been opened I couldn't tell. It works great! My child was so excited and so was I! I will definitely keep this in my Favorites for quick access and I will definitely recommend them! Thanks NT Electronics!"
