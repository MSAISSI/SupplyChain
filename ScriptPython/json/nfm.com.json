It took me 3 days to get this order together for various issues. At one point, my cart even disappeared and could not be accessed. Not to mention, I kept getting signed out. Being over an hour from the store, I totally would have rather come in, but it's not possible for me. So many things not in stock and not shipping for months out, especially rugs. I was going to order two and ended up not getting them because they take so long, even though they are \"in stock\". Very frustrating experience!"

          "Contenu": "We bought a refrigerator from NFM recently.  We live in a rural area about an hour away, so we had it delivered.  Since we had been surprised in the past with a washer and dryer that we'd purchased from NFM in that they refused to hook it up, we specifically asked the sales person if the delivery team would be hooking up the ice maker with the new refrigerator.  She confirmed that they would.  When the refrigerator was delivered, they asked me to remove the entry door to make it easier for them.  I had to unhook the old refrigerator, which we were paying them to take away.  They refused to hook up the new unit.  We spent an hour removing all the protective plastic, installing the refrigerator door handles, hooking up the ice maker, etc.  I'm surprised they just didn't slow down and roll it out of the truck for all the effort they put into delivering this unit. We are very disappointed with the lies told by the appliance salesperson as well.  We need some living room furniture, and we have now chosen to purchase that with an honest business.  Rose Blumkin, who I have personally worked with in the past, would be turning over in her grave to see how this business has degraded."

Do not let this business get away with breaking promises to its customers. This is after NFM\u2019s bogus response. I have already dealt with a half dozen people at NFM and it was a waste of time. They had the opportunity to do the right thing and chose not too. NFM just gives you lip service, not at all good service! These companies ought to be fined like the airlines, for late arrivals and broken promises. That might get their attention that telling the truth is important."

Reps are liars. Rep Elsa lied about delivery date but put notes on the account to show something different from what we were told.  Website show\u2019s delivery in1-2 business days , False.   Ordered on Oct 9th did not receive merchandise until 10/26.  On top of all that the order was cancelled and still got delivered after we were told our refund would be processed in 3-5 business days. Instead of a refund they delivered the beds. I tried calling rep Devin multiple times but no answer.  My wife tried to reach Elsa multiple times no answer nor a callback.  Finally rep Frankie advised we were to receive product on the 26th and it was not cancelled.  I think your company has really poor customer service.  They are liars and I would never shop with your company or recommend to anyone."

          "Contenu": "My significant other and I visited NFM 2-3 times to complete our order. We quoted out laminate and carpet install. The laminate is for 800 sq ft, which is the focal point of my complaint. We had the entire job quoted and was told that we would have to lay OSB on the subfloor to bring it to the right level. My house was built in 2006 with very good materials. We spoke with the salesman that said they typically don\u2019t have any problems with anything at install. Move forward to the day of install. They rip my carpet up and reveal one seam that has a slight change in level. Their installer immediately says we have to pay 2500$ cash to level the entire area. I find this troubling for so many reasons. First, the installer so quickly jumped to a cash only fix. This is something that randomly came out and isn\u2019t being added to my financing? I call the store. The sales floor manager and install manager confirm that the installers can simply add anything to their quotes. I\u2019m sorry I got all these quotes from NFM for their contractors to determine anything they wanted? Who simply has 2500 cash to hand to someone? I feel like NFM needs better control of their contractors. It felt like I got my house destroyed and was basically held hostage to 2500$ or we leave now. This is unbecoming of NFM as a company. These installers were incredibly unprofessional telling me that my floor was basically junk. I had the floor reviewed by other contractors and they said those edges were tilted. 1 hour of sanding later and the \u201chorrible\u201d floor is easily doable. NFM wrecked this entire experience and wrecked my Thanksgiving. I cannot have my Thanksgiving at my house now that it\u2019s a complete disaster. Thank you for holding me hostage and destroying my house."

I refused the mattress, and paid a little more for another inexpensive mattress. I took it, but I regret my entire purchase. I can't take it back, because the sale is final since I didn't pay the additional $60,  approximately, for the mattress protection plan. If I had bought the plan and kept the mattress 30 days, then I would have had to pay an addition $60 or more to return it - that's over $120 to return and the plan. One of the other returns, I think 60 days, would have been 30% of the mattress cost to restock plus the plan fee. I really regret this purchase that I just got home with, and I am stuck with it."

Please don't listen to the sales team about when your items will be delivered, if it's not in their warehouse because there will be delays, and they will lie and tell you whatever to get the sale. At this point, I know that no one will call me to reassure me that they are monitoring this closely, because no one has checked on me yet. I'm just hoping that I get my furniture items before my lease ends next year! Honestly, NFM has good quality furniture, but horrible customer service relations. BE CAREFUL OF THE SALES.!!!!!!!The response that you gave me did not address my concerns, I understand that delays will happen, but it has been the lack of communication that I was referring to, and now I'm adding a lack of comprehension skills as well."

The issue was the 1 and only time I needed customer service to assist. The customer service put the incorrect shipment of the felt (incorrect color) on a pool table all on me and was doing little to assist. How hard would it have been to send someone out to replace the felt on a pool table with the right color and also compensate me for the damage on the 3K pool table? Doping such and offering real compensation for the damage (could have been verified when they replaced the felt) would have made me very happy and kept a customer for life. Instead it was made out to be all my fault and I was offered 50 bucks. NFM customer service does not value their customers. I closed both of my accounts (not that anyone cares or will notice) and I will search for a company who actually cares about their customers (hard to find these days)."

Turns out the salesman wrote my sales ticket out WRONG.  How was I to know he filled it out wrong. When I tried to use this insurance I found out I was not covered for what I thought I signed up for. The kicker is they don\u2019t care. I was supposed to get a new washer and dryer tomorrow from them. Since I found out a loyal customer means nothing. They gave a loyal customer up for about a100 dollars."

          "Contenu": "I have dealt with the NFM in the Colony TX since they opened. Our first purchase was a disaster to get it delivered. We ended up giving up getting everything right and we purchased a new bed at Ashley furniture for our daughter. We chalked it up to it being a new store opening going through growing pains. Fast forward a few years and we decide to give them another shot and buy an entertainment center. It too arrived with a big divot but I was actually relieved the damage  was minimal and accepted figuring it would probably be worse the second time around.So now to what will probably be our last time buying anything there. My parents are moving into senior living and I wanted to help with the transition buy buying them new bedroom furniture. We picked out a set for my dad and my mom along with a couch for their new place. Of course my mothers set is damaged and they sent a replacement. The second set arrived also completely damaged. Now here is where it gets interesting. The delivery guys are contractors. They just drop off furniture. First they tried to deliver furniture but weren't told they were supposed to pick anything up. So they were refusing to pick up the damaged furniture the previous delivery guys dropped off. Then one of the delivery guys reveals that the furniture was already refused by another customer and the warehouse asked them to deliver it anyway and see if we would accept it. I have zero idea who is running this show but when they sent people to fix the store 8 years ago from the Nebraska store, they failed to keep the same culture once they left the area. If I could give them ZERO stars, I certainly would."

Instead they credited me only $10 because I used the $10 coupon. So basically my coupon was worthless; they kept that money for themselves. I could walk in today and buy it cheaper with this coupon.This is the second microwave I\u2019ve had to buy from them in the last 2 years. If they want to anger a customer over $10 that\u2019s their business. This isn\u2019t right.They acted like they did me a favor by giving me a $10 store credit but I don\u2019t really want it now. Shame on them.UPDATE: After contacting customer service they agreed to refund the extra $10. It\u2019s not their policy to do this which I can\u2019t understand, but they made an exception in my case. I\u2019m happy they did."

          "Contenu": "The last few times I've ordered I have been shocked at the amount of time it takes to receive an order, especially when I live IN NEBRASKA.  I understand some things have to be ordered but is there not a more efficient and effective way to handle this? I think the biggest thing is....it was very hard to make a purchase decision based on SO MANY crappy reviews. I didn't really want to go to the trouble of opening another account with a different company and end up with two open furniture credit accounts. All the negative reviews seem to be similar and reference shoddy craftsmanship. You have to see this. You have to be seeing the number of reviews that come through that are all similar and are all complaining about the same thing.....crappy furniture. I purchased some furniture from NFM back in the 1990's and I was very pleased. We received the order quickly - which was shipped to Kansas City before there was a store there. Now, I can't tell you the number of people of whom I've heard say that they simply just stopped shopping at NFM because the quality of furniture has steadily gone down hill. So why are you continuing to purchase from the same companies? Why are you not demanding that their standards be a higher quality? NFM is huge. It seems like you would be in a position to make demands or threaten using other venders. I urge you to truly sit down and take the time to read MANY reviews. If there is an item that has (for example) 23 reviews with an average of 4.5 stars, one would think that has to be pretty good. Don't look at that stat and nothing else. Go in and read the reviews. You'll see that there are many reviews for that one specific piece of furniture that all reference crappy, cheap furniture. That isn't what NFM USED to stand for. Step up. Rebrand! Make this a better shopping experience, especially for mid to lower earners who really look for deals and affordable pricing. It has turned into \"affordable=cheap furniture\" at NFM.  Y'all should fix that."

The only description difference was that one would deliver tomorrow, and one would deliver in two days."

She yelled at me saying \" 1st of all there's no garuntuee that these will work in South Africa,\" and I said to ger, we;ve bought these before and they work fine. She continue to argue that they may not work and was annoyed- I'm not sure to take this as Xenophobic or just a bad customer service on her side. I told her, we'll use the phone either way. The entire time we were there she was just awful. She told if she order the phone it will be available 1st week of August and the other phone that was comparable to that phone was not available at all, my surprise when I check your website this morning the phone is available in 2 weeks from today. I've been a loyal customer of Nebraska for over 15 years and never experienced this.  I just ordered the phone and it will be available in 2 weeks. When I went to pay for my items that  bought, the teller asked for my ID, he was polite, but I was surprised, I've never been asked for ID before and everybody around me were paying using their NFM credit cards without ID. These 2 incidents spoiled my entire day, we drive  to NFM for 2 hrs, it is always fun and a great experience- we get coffees and eat lunch and always treated fairly and great. I can't get over this, but I love NFM."

When I added a laptop to my cart most sites would send me a link to accessories.  I had to search for them by hand and you don't sell the Apple-branded ones I was looking for for this item.  I will instead buy these accessories elsewhere.  This is money NFM could have collected from me by carrying a wider array of products including Apple-branded ones.  That money will now go to another store.I appreciate your response and I don't need anything - I am and will remain an NFM customer.  Please consider this feedback as intended to be constructive.  The user experience of your site quite frankly needs updating.  When you add an item to cart, if there are accessories that match that exact item you should be given the opportunity to do this on the spot.  Heck, Amazon even pre-bundles items FOR YOU and gives you the option to click to add all three - say, a laptop, a bag, and a spare charger - NFM should do this too.  It's basic UX design.  Love the company, longtime customer here, not going anywhere.  Just do better on your ecommerce site."

Also confusing was the ability to request haul away at a price for each item. I was also not able to schedule a technician to come out for installation. I am unsure what to do about that. However, overall it was a good experience and hopefully we'll be receiving three new appliances in the next two weeks. Thank you."
