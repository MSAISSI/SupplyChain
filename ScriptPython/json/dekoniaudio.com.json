          "Contenu": "I was looking for a replacement ear-pad for my Momentum first gen. I didn't want to order some cheap china stuff so when i found this brand i was willing to pay import duties and vat to get some stock. Product description and the YouTube. presentation video said that it was compatible, but the product received was at least a 1CM to big and didn't hold.I sent a first mail asking for information and how to resolve this with them on the official support address... Waited a week, no reply.I sent a follow-up, waited another week, still no reply.Because i was to lazy, i payed using Amazon paid. I used the A-to-Z amazon page to send another message... Still no reply.I ended up making a warranty claim on it and since they apparently didn't reply either, got my money back.Sadly i won't be able to get VAT and duties back because that fight is impossible here, but at least i have this. To resume. The product description is wrong, they either don't check any of their support contact or deliberately ghost their client, and if you don't pay using a third party you have no change of ever getting you money back... Would not recommend weirdly !"

This is regarding the Arya ear cups simply not being compatible with the older generation and these people don't even have the ability to correct their false advertising.

I had to keep messing with the position of the headphones to get it to sound even. I know Dekoni does not offer refunds on B-Stock but I sent an email to try and work something out and no reply at all. Stay away from B-Stock because you don't know what you will get. If you have an issue with Dekoni, hopefully your experience will be better than mine. Tossed the pads in the trash."

I have left them in a bag with baking soda for about a year because I haven\u2019t wanted to touch them. I understand that B-Stock means no returns but I was sent F-stock\u2026those should have been killed with fire. I washed my old set of Dakoni ear pads and lived with the old ones but I haven\u2019t been tempted to buy new ones because I made the mistake of trying to save a buck. If I ever buy a new set, I\u2019ll have to eat the cost of the B-Stocks and have wasted a money instead of saving any. I will NEVER buy B-Stock again."

It works as advertised in most cases.What unfortunately is the case is the company it self is very poor on the customer support and QC on their products. you can expect stitching to tear and glue to fall off before it should. Unfortunately the warranty and customer service is a lot to ask for as well. it's unfortunate because they make decent products but often have a lot of issues with the smaller parts such as stitching and or glue issues. this should not degrade due to wear as fast as they do and unfortunately i've had a lot of products have this exact issue.Overal id say give them a try but dont get your hopes up for the product to last."

Slow service, and not premium customer service.  I feel I'd be better off with Brainwaivz or Wicked Cushions as those seem to fit better, and are easier to install and actually stay on without glue!  If you want premium pads for a Audeze or highfiman Dekoni is a strong option, but for an ath,  or AKG style... never again.  Total waste of money and a poor customer support option over those holidays."

Not really better or worse overall, just different. W/r/t comfort, they are not quite as soft as the stock pads, but they are firmer and deeper, making it less likely for one's ears to contact the surface of the cloth over the drivers. The increased depth/thickness also increases marginally the clamping force on the head, but not to the detriment of comfort, though I have never been very sensitive to clamp, so ymmv. The biggest difference is the increased apparent durability over the stock pads, which start to self-destruct seemingly immediately, while the Elite hybrids seem very stout in build-quality."

When looking for replacement pads, I stumbled onto these and ordered them hoping they would be worth the money.  To say they are is an understatement.  I can now listen for several hours without discomfort and the improved sound isolation makes the headphones sound even better.  Considering what the headphones cost in the first place, they should have come with something like this, at least now I have headphones I enjoy listening to"

Pads feel very good, it adds some clamp in a good way, since they feel loose with the og pads.Sound wise:I got them with the intention of lowering the treble peak. It achieved that. Detail goes down, but its well worth if you find these sharp.It also made the headphone quieter so you will need more power to reach the same level of volumes (from 72% to 77% on my amp)."
