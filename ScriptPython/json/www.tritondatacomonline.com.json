Their is an IP line running through every condo in our building. The phone you sent did Not have a charger, it was Not advertised without a charger. You misinform your customers after it\u2019s delivered then expect them to pay more for it. The camera did not work and the handset was faulted. It took forever to get a refund and multiple calls before this could happen then it was forever before you credited it back. This review is more than fair and completely justified.

The second is because of the lack of communication. I was not told, after placing the order online, that the product was not in stock. I had to email Triton on 2/7 to find out why the order had not shipped to be told that they were out of stock, but had product coming in in a few days. Sent another email on 2/17 and did not get a response. Received an email on 2/18 that the product had been shipped (it hadn't). Received another email on 2/21 that the product shipped (it did). The phone I ordered works just like it was supposed to, so no issues there. Just a little better communication from Triton would have earned 5 stars."
