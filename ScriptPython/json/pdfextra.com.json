As I am within the timescale to cancel, please cancel this purchase, and either 'refuse/refund' the \u00a341.29. The other 'issue', as I was trying to get it to work, it pooped up offering me an offer to purchase: once 'free trial ended,  for \u00a329+!!!! Not impressed at all. I need to fathom out how to edit: and what to use to do this: so will ho to an expert to aid me. Therefore I can't use, nor want this pdf extra program. Thank you. Abbey Emery"

The app offers a wide range of features that make working with PDFs a breeze. I can easily edit and annotate my documents, add signatures, and even convert PDFs to other formats. The app's user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, making it simple to find and use the features I need. Additionally, the app is fast and responsive, which means I can get my work done quickly and efficiently. Overall, I highly recommend the PDF Extra app to anyone who regularly works with PDFs."

Other than that, PDF Extra is a great software and on par with Adobe Acrobat Pro, in my opinion.  My biggest hiccup is not being able to create Read Aloud pdf's."
