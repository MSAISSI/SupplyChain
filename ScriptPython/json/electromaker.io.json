          "Contenu": "order never went through. couldn't reach customer support. When I called, I reached a voicemail box that said \"Supplier Direct\". This business seems like a front, or maybe a dropshipper or something.Update (after electromaker response): my order sat in \"Pending\" status for several days. I got a random email to update my credit card with no reason why I had to do this and it was on an alternate domain, so that seemed suspicious. I did it anyway, against my better judgement, because I wanted the order to go through. No confirmation or any other update. I emailed and reached out about the matter and no response...including from calling (which as mentioned, the voicemail mentions some OTHER company). It is also curious that the phone number shows that it's located in Mansfield, Texas which is where Mouser and Digikey are....something is weird with these companies...."

Order from another reseller or direct from the companies.Updated to correct their errors in their response to save face.They requested a photo of a board that doesn't power on after a 2 day wait. I had already informed them I had tried the board with 2 computers and 3 cables. I responded with the photo within 2 hours of the initial request after asking why a photo was needed because the photo is basically worthless as there is no verification that the board is even plugged in. (they don't require to see it plugged into the usb socket as well providing power) After I responded with the photo, I waited another 5 days for a response. After stating I would be requesting a chargeback their next response was \"did you follow the tutorial\" on the Adafruit website. They would do everything possible to NOT issue a refund. Electromaker IS NOT an authorized reseller and Adafruit is looking into how they are selling their products without authorization so hopefully others won't have to deal with this in the future."

          "Contenu": "SUMMARY OF CUSTOMER EXPERIENCENot good at all. I placed an order for an item that was shown as in stock, and after 1 month of trying to get an order update it turns out the item was not available. Communication was practically nonexistent until I wrote an online review. COMPLETE TIMELINE OF MY (UNFULFILLED) ORDERNovember 2, 2022:Placed an order on the Electromaker.io website; the item was clearly shown as in stock and available to \"buy now\" (not showing out of stock or back ordered) - this was why I placed my order. November 4, 2022:4 days later, received 1 email from Electromaker.io confirming my order.November 18, 2022:2 weeks later, I had zero communication about my order so sent an email directly to Electromaker.io asking for an update. No response from Electromaker.ioNovember 21, 2022:No reply to my email 3 days prior, so I sent a SECOND email directly to Electromaker.io asking for an update. No response from Electromaker.ioNovember 22, 2022:Frustrated at the complete lack of responses, I wrote my initial review on TrustPilot, as after searching the Internet for any advice it seemed like posting on TrustPilot was the only way to get Electromaker.io to respond to anything.November 23, 2022;Surprise! Electromaker.io replied to my TrustPilot review THE VERY NEXT DAY. Why they cannot reply to customer emails that are sent directly to them, I don't know. They asked for my order info in their reply, so I immediately edited my TrustPilot review (within minutes of their response) to add that information.November 24, 2022:I sent a THIRD email directly to Electromaker.io asking for an update. No response from Electromaker.ioNovember 28, 2022:Electromaker.io finally replied to my email, informing me the item is on backorder. This reply finally arrived after over 3 weeks of trying to communicate with them directly through email and after writing my initial TrustPilot review. Within minutes I responded back, asking them to cancel my order.November 29, 2022:Well go figure... Electromaker.io replied to an email the very next day, confirming the cancellation of my order. AFTERMATHThis entire process took 1 entire month from start to finish - from the day I placed my order under the impression that the item was available as shown on their website... all the way to the end of the month when they finally replied to my email and canceled my unfulfilled order. What bothers me the most is not that I didn't receive the item I ordered - but that there was ZERO RESPONSE to my inquiries until AFTER I wrote my 1-star TrustPilot review. Why couldn't anyone at Electromaker.io reply to a customer email (actually, 3 customer emails) within 3 weeks? Why did it take a public review for them to finally respond at all? I honestly do not think that I was being unreasonable, nor do I think I was bombarding them with emails or being a difficult customer by simply asking for an order update.  Unfortunately, Electromaker.io's communication was practically nonexistent, up until I wrote the TrustPilot review.So in the end, I do not have the product I ordered 1 month prior. Because there was an eventual conclusion (they agreed to cancel my unfulfilled order) I hold no grudge or anger at the company at all. However, I will most likely not recommend Electromeker.io to others based on my first (and most likely only) buying experience with them."

And very disappointing when Electromaker doesn\u2019t support some searches for basic necessities. I could not find some basic staple supplies, and I would have purchased them if I could.Contrast this to sparkfun.com, who sells me solder, plain old resistor and capacitor kits, leds that are just leds, and knobs/switches only your mother could love, but we all know we need these things every day. So yes Electromaker has a potent selection of mcu peripherals but lacks some ordinary things to make it a one-stop shopping experience. When I have looked for stock parts on Mouser I often give up because a search for a 1/4 watt 2.2k ohm resistor yields pages of results. If Electromaker gave me a limited set of valid, reasonable choices it would be awesome."
