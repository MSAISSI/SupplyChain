It can see tiny variations in temps, has a pretty long range for my uses as a homeowner, and I'm just overall very impressed with the whole experience. For reference, I'm just a DIY homeowner trying to do a little bit of weatherizing. If that sounds like you, this is the product to get for sure.

The IR0005 Thermal Camera targeted that the roof was the problem to investigate. Once that was fixed we were able to see how ingress affected the inner walls of the condo. We followed that with a basic pinless moisture meter to isolate exactly where the problem was and how concerning it should be and are able to monitor the drying process without opening the wall. This 2 pronged approach helped us avoid a costly restoration company and plumber visits. We went straight to the roofer for repairs and could monitor our own inner wall moisture problems. I would recommend the IR0005 Thermal Camera for just such an approach. It worked as suggested and we have one now in case a further incident should arise."

During that time, I continued to wonder if other, more accurate options were available.  I researched some other products, but none of them seemed suitable.  The requirements I have are the ability to measure temperature at 4 points on the heat presses.  Thermocouples would be required due to the size of these presses and the need to measure temperature under heat, pressure and time.  These presses are anywhere from 11 inches by 14 inches to 48 inches by 96 inches.  These presses utilize up to 4 heating elements, depending upon the size of the press.  So far the TC41 has worked very well for my needs.  The device reads slightly lower than the gauge on the heat press, but is far less subjective than using paper thermometers."

Ik  gebruik het voor verwarmen van motor onderdelen en daarvoor is het een handig ding. Schakelt vanzelf uit om lang met batterij te doen, is ook makkelijk. Duidelijke laserpointer om te weten waar de temperatuur gemeten wordt en alleen actief wanneer er gemeten wordt zodat je niet per ongeluk in de straal kijkt. Verlichte display is handig voor donkere inzet, ik mis alleen mogelijk om koordje zoals bij digitale camera vast te zetten om de thermometer aan je pols te kunnen laten bungelen."
