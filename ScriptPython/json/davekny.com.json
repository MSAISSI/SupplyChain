The quality however is so so and I have replaced 3 of them since they provide what they call \"Unconditional Lifetime Guarantee\". Now an umbrella broke again, the 4th, and I contacted support. Now I receive the information that for some reason they do not ship replacement umbrellas to Sweden. I can buy umbrella on their website and have it shipped to Sweden, but apparently not when I excercise my \"unconditional\" lifetime guarantee, because then it is suddenly conditional that I do not live in Sweden. So, somehow you have to make sure that you do not live in a country to which they do not ship for some obscure reason."

Your company makes us to all the work for the return, pay for return shipping, and would deduct the original shipping cost from the refund.  That is a very bad return policy and I will not order any more products from your company.  Nor would I recommend you to my friends.  A good return policy is what people looking for these days, in the age of online shopping."

I checked and they want me to pay them MORE money to SHIP it to them so they can \u201cfix\u201d the faulty umbrella. I\u2019ll just buy from a better company for far less. What a scam. Don\u2019t buy from this company, it\u2019s all marketing and zero followthrough."

          "Contenu": "I bought the Davek Solo in Dec 2016, and being in the super rainy Vancouver I must say I am pretty disappointed in this umbrella.  For the past 5 years I had to send in my umbrella for repair pretty much 1-2 times a year.  The spoke design seems to be pretty weak as it breaks pretty easily.  While it has a lifetime warranty, I had to pay for shipping for the past 6 repairs which had already cost me the amount equivalent to the price of a brand new Solo by now.  For an umbrella this expensive, I'd expect much stronger framework and not something so flimsy, easy-to-break, poor quality like this umbrella.  Another spoke on the Solo umbrella just broke on me again today - but I am not going to spend more money on this anymore.  I will just get another brand that will last me much longer than Davek Solo."

The spring tension wire exerts too much force where it passes through the spar. Consequently the spar bends, then work hardens and breaks.I would not recommend anyone buy the Davek traveller. the postage payable to replace the umbrella is unsustainable, particularly considering the premium price paid. I hope davek reengineer this product.Update- davekny responded immediately to assist. I cannot fault the US office customer service. Time will tell if this replacement will break the same way."

Unfortunately I've owned three Davek umbrellas, and all of them have broken after a few months of use. The metal pieces in the mechanism become damaged and the umbrella won't properly open or close without manual adjustment each time. The velcro stitching on all three of my umbrellas has also come undone (leaving the velcro hanging by the stitching on one side. I have never experienced these issues with much cheaper brands of umbrellas. While there is a lifetime warranty, you have to pay for shipping plus an additional $10 for return shipping, and I'd much rather have an umbrella that doesn't break in the first place."

While waiting for this umbrella I read many reviews of the most highly rated umbrellas and in most did not see any Davek umbrellas in the top with the exception of the elite appearing in one article but not at the top. I contacted the company to discuss returning mine for the elite but requesting free return shipping since I\u2019ve already spent enough. The woman was very rude and had an angered tone, stating they have already spent too much shipping 2 umbrellas to me for free. This in a day when many companies ship for free and send return free shipping labels.  I am truly disgusted with this interaction.

The umbrella seemed very well-built and sturdy so I was very excited to use it. To put it slightly, the umbrella didn't live up to my expectations at all. It felt really cheap (the fabric part). It was also a little windy that day and and I had trouble balancing the umbrella; it felt like it was going to fly away. It is was not THAT windy, not at all. The umbrella looked and felt very sturdy laying around my room, but when when push comes to shove, it is pretty useless and unreliable. I am utterly disappointed and wish I had just a bought a cheap one as I am pretty sure it would've performed way better."

Would not recommend, even at a $50 price point, much less at a $150 price point.Also, the handle looks fancy and all, but is very uncomfortable to hold. The wrist strap is too small for any practical use; it'll just catch you as you're trying to put the umbrella away.When I initially bought this, I'd emailed DavekNY about my concerns about the similarity to the Totes umbrellas (right down to the \"ENSON-D4\" stamps on the aluminum arms), but they refused to provide any evidence that these were not just some mass-produce junk that they rebranded and swapped out the handles on. I decided to hold off on writing a review until I'd used it in the rain. Now that I have, I'm confident speaking about it.The one thing I give it credit for, is looking pretty.

I used it for at least an hour and the medal hinge became undone. I saw a loose bolt pop out and figured I could try to fix it. Next thing I know a rope on the pole itself appeared and I could no longer open the umbrella properly. I would have to hold the top in order for it to hold up. I did NOT do anything out of the normal. For all that money I paid--I was like \"really?\" I got angry. I landed up shipping it back and wanting a refund. It costs me $17 to ship back which I don't think I should pay for since it broke. Davek should provide a free shipping tag to return.  What a total bummer. This umbrella is probably made with cheap parts.  With all that happened to me....I wouldn't recommend any umbrella from this company."

My conclusion is that the replacement card is a marketing gimmick and gives the customer nothing.Additionally I constantly receive promotional emails from Davek with discounts for products I'm not interested in, however when I tried to make a purchase was told this product was at full retail price and \"unfortunately we are not running a promotion on Traveler model at this time\" My conclusion from dealing with Davek is that Davek does not value it's customers, does not honor it's manufactured product guarantees and once it makes a sale it has no interest in you."

          "Contenu": "An great value proposition on paper, but lackluster product and subpar customer service.I think the concept of having an high quality umbrella with a lifetime guarantee and loss protection is great, it is what brought my interest in the product in the first place. (I have never used the loss protection so cannot speak on that to be fair)I have purchased the Solo, but have had multiple issues with frames bending after a short period of use.After the first replacement, I have notice a frames not extending out fully, which after - few uses got progressively worse and had to send it in again for repair. When I received the second pair, it also had the similar issues which later evolved into an unusable umbrella. To be fair, the second replacement at this moment is still usable.I have reached out to customer service to express my concern, but they genuinely seem to not care, and said that is the normal range of motion. Maybe they are right, I will give them the benefit of the doubt, but so many issues on what they advertise as a premium umbrella should not be occurring so often.I do have the mini as well, and that has worked great for years, so my advice is the following:1. Do not buy the Solo \u2014\u2014 if you look online other people have had issues as well. (The mini works great as a backup/emergency umbrella would recommend that one if you need a backup umbrella) 2. Do not expect much from customer service.Fees for shipping and replacement/repairs do add up, so I will see how the second replacement goes, but I will not be purchasing from them or be asking for further repair. (Update: I have realized I reviewed them a few years back as well. Going back for a repair given my poor experience, that was on me, my fault. Never again.)"

While it is nice to have it fixed for free, but I have to pay for shipping each time, and take the time and trouble to ship it back, which is a pain and which adds even more to the cost of an overpriced umbrella.  So, I give up and will not ship them back again.  Will throw them away and stick with your average priced umbrella from Totes or other company. Much cheaper, even in the long run having to buy multiple average priced umbrellas.  Do not recommend Davek and will not buy again.  They package a nice looking umbrella with the same basic durability of your average umbrella and charge a fortune for it, trying to make it look very upscale, but in the end, the lack of durability makes it a fail."

This product is flat out NOT worth $100!Sure, it was delivered quickly and when I called Davek with questions (such as where it was actually manufactured (China, by the way) there was no problems whatsoever."

I have used it a handful of times, and unfortunately a small screw in the spokes broke off. This is when I discovered the drawbacks of a \u201clifetime\u201d guarantee. I have to pay for postage to send it for repair and also enclose postage of \u00a39.99 to have it returned to me. Considering how quickly it broke this time, I can imagine quickly spending more than it cost in the first place to have it repaired. In my opinion it has lasted such a short time that Davek should at the very least be paying for postage. In my opinion it\u2019s not fit for purpose. So no, I won\u2019t be returning it and will have to put it down to a costly mistake."

I think that for the money, my umbrella should have at least an automatic close and open button but instead, the umbrella opens and closes manually.  So, I was disappointed in the quality.  I like the size because I travel a lot and wanted something small for my suitcase -- I'm a flight attendant and space is important.  But I really wanted something with an automatic open and close feature on it.  Thanks!  Hope this helps."

If indoors, it might not be so distracting, but while driving, it does become a distraction. I suppose I can turn off the connection until I get out of the car & turn it on when I've opened the umbrella for the rain, but, if I forget, the device doesn't service its purpose. I'm confused as to what's best to make this work for me. Please help with suggestions. Between the ones I've purchased & the ones I inherited from my mother, I must have 8 Davek umbrellas & wouldn't want to use any one of them. Thanks. Nancy"

The culprit is the very weak material used for the ribs. I have analyzed the damages. One rib was twisted and bent like a pretzel. I could not believe how thin the metal was. One rib was separated from the joint that folds. Lastly, one rib just snapped off, as if the metal was cut in half with a sharp knife. Due to the cost of the umbrellas, we have been very careful using them. I have spent over $250 having 2 of them shipped to me in Thailand from Japan, believing these will last for years. I am very disappointed and I will not purchase this model again. Davek definitely needs to use much stronger metal for the ribs."

I kept the warranty card for the umbrella and emailed through to the team and they sent me another one.. Well this other one they sent me is also broken now and I swear that I do not do anything out of ordinary with them! So I do not recommend buying these umbrellas and I do not think they are the quality that they advertise to be!

I have to say that their claims of quality and durability should come with qualifications. Their policy of replacement once you pay them postage, pack your broken umbrella and return it was made good on in a timely manner, however, and Dave K was concerned about this review to a point that he emailed me twice during the return process. The replacement umbrellas appear to conform with the quality of the original purchases. This is one way to provide a guarantee though time will tell if further returns and their accompanying inconvenience are required."

I suggest in the near future Davek  offers customers much more options on shipping. Will I order the product again, in the near future sure i will.  I know your products/product are top notch and craftmanship that goes into the umbrellas are second to none. I feel at this moment and time i will not be ordering your product again or referring you on Social Media  until shipping options are improved.Happy New YearRegards,Keith"

BUT the wrist strap is too small to be easy to use, and because it's so thick and stuck in one spot on the handle, it makes it very uncomfortable to hold the umbrella with your left hand, assuming you want to be able to press the button with your thumb.The fabric is still only tacked on at the same amount of points as the Totes umbrella, nothing fancy. Also, it often doesn't completely open with just a button press - you have to give it a little shake or manually push the slider up the rest of the way. I contacted support when I found this, and even offered to try oiling the shaft, but they claimed this is \"normal\".This is a $25 umbrella with a $5 rock-solid good-looking uncomfortable-to-use handle - as best as I can tell, certainly not worth $150."

It would have been nice if someone would have at least responded to my concern regarding their products quality, however there was only an invoice and new umbrella in the box.  I also drive late model BMW's and when taken in for service they provide me nice loaner vehicles with a smile.  This weekend my loaner is a new 108K vehicle.  They smiled and said enjoy!

          "Contenu": "My original Davek Umbrella I bought 3 years ago was strong, heavy duty, with leather wrap around.  Three years later I wanted to buy another one, the same because the original one I bought three years ago was worn out.  But it lasted a great three years.  I go to the same store where I purchased the first one, and I\u2019m being told that particular one I purchased three years ago was discontinued.  Supposedly the next one I purchased was supposed to be similar to the one I purchased three years ago.  When I took the lid off of the box and took this umbrella out of the box, not only it did not have that leather wrap around, it was smaller,  and when I opened it, it was smaller, and the material looked cheap.  It was not heavy duty.  It was lightweight!!  Lightweight against the winds in NYC will not last beyond a few months, that about the time it would fall apart.  I did not keep this, I took it back to the store.  The management said this was the best they could do.  I asked for a refund.  The following week I called the Davek Corporate Office, on Madison Avenue.  After explaining my plight to one of the executives, he said he would look to see if it could be find the exact kind I purchased three years ago by calling the warehouse.  A couple of days later I received another Umbrella.  I opened the box, it was not the heavy duty one, but it did have the leather wrap around.   Instead, it was the same lightweight cheap one I bought at the store.  The only thing different was it had the leather wrap around.  It was smaller then the original and lightweight.This was no good.  I called the corporate office again, and spoke with the same executive.  He said that there was nothing more they could do.  Except get a refund by send them back the other one.  I sent it back.   Not happy about this.  Davek was supposed to be about Quality!  The original one I bought three years ago was $149.00, but it was worth it!  Now, I spend $149.00, and get a smaller, lightweight piece of garbage."

          "Contenu": "The sewing on the strap became loose after two uses. Reached out to the company upon registering the product, but no response. I don't think it is fair that I would have to pay shipping and handling for a repairing/replacing a faulty product.*UPDATE*Firstly, I would like to revise the rating from a 1-Star to 2-Star, since 1-Star was defined as \"1 star: Bad \u2013 unacceptable experience, unreasonable and rude conduct.\". None of the representatives were rude in any way, so I thought this revision would be fair.Secondly, to clarify, this is on the Solo Umbrella. While my review is negative, I do love the look and feel of the umbrella except for the defective strap. I've also bought the Mini, which is holding up great so far.Thirdly, upon the post of my first review, I did receive an e-mail from their support team:\"Sorry we missed your original email. If your umbrella needs repair, you can send it back to us as per the warranty. We will either fix it or  more likely send a brand new umbrella back to you. Please send the umbrella back to us for repair/replacement...Include your name, mailing address and receipt for return shipping payment  with your return. \"While I understand that it is fair for customers to pay for shipping both ways (to Davek and back to you) if it is a repair due to regular wear-and-tear or customer-driven factors. However, it does not seem fair to the customers who received a defective product, who will have to pay shipping to davek PLUS an additional $9.95 for return shipping (essentially a 20 dollar penalty). This was my original issue, and that being responded by a standard template response that does not even address the issue, was a major disappointment for me. Since I don't want the strap to ruin the integrity of the entire umbrella, I will be returning this for a replacement. Hopefully that one will hold up.Their lifetime guarantee does offer some great benefits for long-term users, but can really short-change those who receive a defective product.Fellow customers, please be aware you are taking that risk with this umbrella."

I was going to return, but you have to pay for shipping back and they also deduct $10 for the original shipping to you. So it will cost you more than $20 to return a $59 umbrella. BTW you can also purchase these umbrella's from AMAZON."

For instance, the frame geometry is complex, and there are small, hand-tied strings that tether the fabric and the frame. These tethers help coax the fabric into conforming to the shape as the frame folds. On my product, one of these string ties has come completely undone, and another is untied and about to come unraveled. It will still function, but it doesn't fold neatly without manually tucking the fabric into place."

Now the umbrella needs to be returned, and the company will not be reimbursing for the shipping. I was considering replacing it with a travel umbrella, which is slightly larger and has the automatic open close mechanism, but the Exchange policy does not include reimbursement for shipping."

I don\u2019t see anything in the reviews about it.The traveler is aesthetically nice. It looks like an expensive umbrella, which it is. That is where my positive ends. I was planning to give it to my mother since it gave me the impression that it would be easy for her to use with just the push of a button. It isn\u2019t. First of all, it\u2019s quite heavy. Secondly, the wrist strap gets in the way. Thirdly, I find it extremely (yes extremely) difficult to pull it back to lock it. I am a guy in my 40s and my mother is in her 70s. This won\u2019t be a good buy if you have some hand or wrist issues."

They apologized and offered to send out a new umbrella immediately. They also offered to send a shipping label to return the defective one. I have not received the replacement umbrella yet.

My hope with the new product is that it will not suffer the same fate."

          "Contenu": "The DAVEK DUET is a quality umbrella to be sure, but probably not worth the price. The leather loop which connects the handstrap to the umbrella is designed in such a way that it will crease whenever the handstrap is being used properly; i.e. when the strap is in hand and the umbrella is suspended below. The only time it won't crease is when the handstrap is laying alongside the length of the umbrella, which is only good if you don't store it hanging. This creasing will shortly result in that leather looking very worn, even while the umbrella is relatively new."

It didn't break during my trip when I used it or packed it, so time will tell. I had a really hard time finding it in person to avoid the hefty shipping fee. All of the retailers listed on the Davek website say they don't carry Davek and have never heard of the company. Their website desperately needs updating."

The canopy is of a strong, heavy canvas. The wood is comfortable to the hands. The only improvements I would suggest are extending the crook so that the umbrella might be hung over one's shoulder, and tightening up the metal a bit. Overall, a fine piece. The most valuable part by far is the unconditional lifetime warranty."

They could have added another piece of velcro where the name strap could be attached properly on the umbrella canopy. It would look more professional and it would clearly advertise the umbrella and its company without someone having to contort themself into another dimension. Very pleased with the purchase regardless."

          "Contenu": "I purchased the Traveler umbrella in the red color.  The umbrella came in a timely manner and was well packaged.  The umbrella was heavier than other ones that I own, so it might not be as welcome to put in your luggage with strict weight limits on airlines.  The color was nice, and the umbrella operated fine with the button; you push it once to open and then once again to close.  The only issue that I have is that it was soooooo difficult to pull/push the umbrella closed so that it would lock in a down position.  The first four or five times that I tried, I could not get the umbrella to lock down.  I thought that there was a defect in the locking mechanism, but I was finally able to get the umbrella to lock in the down position.  I don't know if I'll be happy trying to struggle with locking the umbrella when traveling!"

The lady on the other line took care of it promptly and sent me my replacement which I received a couple days later -- it is defective and doesn't open all the way. Shortly thereafter, I get an email saying that before they can ship my replacement (not realizing they had already sent it to me) I would need to pay more money. I emailed them telling them I've already received it and the poor experience I received. They responded back apologizing and word-for-word wrote \"Since you have already received your new unit the shipping fee has been waived.\""

I'm on my third now.  The first didn't make it back from The Bahamas.  I'm hoping someone down there is enjoying it. And then I went to a historical lecture locally with a bunch of well-heeled attendees during a rain storm.  We all dutifully left our wet umbrellas outside.  Sure enough someone one took mine...like they had a Davek too!  They left me with some no-name, black and manual (like mine) one that literally broke the next day as the rain continued.  I'll be sure to be on the lookout at the next rainy event.  Well, I must say from experience that I don't have to wait long for them to be delivered.  I also like those nice bags that they come in.  I have three."

I had a hard time figuring out the size I needed - ended up buying the solo (too small but kept it as a back-up), bought the golf umbrella instead (too big! but I returned it and the return process was very simple and I was promptly refunded), and then bought the Duet (I think that is the name) and this umbrella is just right, as Goldilocks would say. So, I have had three purchase experiences with Davek in the last week, and all made me feel valued as a customer. The size issue on the umbrellas is more an issue I have with conceptualizing measurements vs a product description issue, but maybe a video showing the product in use by humans on the website could be helpful to understand size/operability better. Very happy with this brand and company."
