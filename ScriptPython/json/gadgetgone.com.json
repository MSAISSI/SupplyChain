I politely asked for my phone to be sent back to me when they suddenly upped my offer to $325. Why not offer this right away? My phone is in obviously perfect condition besides minor spots that only show during portrait mode. Not to mention, $325 is still below their price point for \"Fair\" condition even though, according to their site, this means the phone \"shows heavy signs of use such as deep or excessive scratches, dings, dents, scuffs or abrasions but no cracks.\" My phone is in excellent condition! They are lowballing me and are not eager to give me my device back. I'm writing this so others can be aware."

Why would I want GadgetGone harassing me? I have full email documentation of my experience with them. In fact, I had GadgetGone return my iPhone and sent it off to another company who paid me a very fair price for it. Don't trust a review website that deletes negative reviews!!!"

After waiting many days for a quote, I finally received an email stating that my phone is not in the condition I claimed it was in.  They said my phone is not unlocked.  And it actually is, I unlocked it before sending it to them for sure.  Then they claim the condition is nowhere near brand new, more like fair.  Preposterous! No cracks, scratches, no water damage.  It looks brand new like it is right out the box!   They also claim that internally, it doesnt meet \"brand new\" standards.  I can't imagine what a used phone must have to be like for them to pay decently. Realistically the only thing we have to wipe clean a phone is the factory reset.  Simply put there are too many made up issues on my used phone.  And then, the kicker...my quote was $9!  Ha! I paid $199 for it last 10 months ago. Sorry but from my experience, the long wait and  inaccurate evalution, I can say this company is a bit unrealistic for me, a time waster."

          "Contenu": "I mailed an iPhone SE (2020), 128GB, unlocked to GadgetGone to sell it to them. Took photos of front and back of the phone. Packed it in the original box with all the instructions and the charging cable, packed in a ton of bubble wrap. The phone was in like new condition, having never been taken outside the house and only used as a hotspot, with zero scratches on either the front or back. The first email from GadgetGone claimed that the phone was in \"fair\" condition with \"Heavy Scratching\u201d and offered $52, well below the $167 listed on their website . I responded to send the phone back to me. They revised their offer to $67 and after I declined, then to $92. I again declined and told them to send the phone back to me. There is simply no way that this phone is in any condition less than \u201clike new\u201d.I just received the returned phone, but just the phone. None of the original packaging or charging cable were returned to me. The instructions on their website say to \"Gather any accessories that are necessary to the function of your device and include them in the package. Some examples would be *watch bands*, *power cables* for gaming consoles, etc.\" Basically they stole these items from me and it makes it harder for me to sell the phone to another buyer without those items."

          "Contenu": "Claimed heavy scratching on a phone I was trading in and sent pictures, which clearly showed the screen protector still on it which was scratched, not the screen itself.   Tried to provide that information and got a condescending reply.   After several back-and-forths decided to have my item returned, at which point they replied it was shipped back with a screenshot of some portion their website saying my original iPhone box and accessories would not be returned.  Didn't even think twice about that until I recieved my phone back today, in an envelope, no box no charger.   They basically bury that little gem somewhere deep in the FAQs, don't tell you ahead of time then paste that in the \"we've shipped your item back\" email to cover themselves legally maybe.   Shifty company, not forthcoming, and will steal all your accessories and original packaging if you opt for the \"If you aren't happy with the new amount you've been offered, you can elect to have your device shipped back to you. We'll even cover the return shipping cost.\".As a follow up to the reply, just because you have that information somewhere on the website doesn't make it forthcoming.  It is not noted anywhere during the quote/order process that these items will be discarded.   No one is reading the entire website before sending you the items.  As far as the condition, and the correspondence, none of the \"scratches\" that were noted/photographed by your team were actually there when I received the device back, so those were either on the screen protector as I noted in my emails to customer service, or not pictures of my device at all.  As soon as I received the device back, I immediately sent it to another service like yours and received no mention of scratches or damage of any kind and received full price for my trade, which to be honest was a higher price than you initially quoted even prior to trying to reduce it.  So I suppose all in all this interaction worked out in my favor."

At the time of purchase the Apple associate inserted my new phone into a protective case purchased at the same time and applied a screen protector.  These were never removed until sending to Gadget Gone.  My phone was listed as Flawless as it was.  I checked it over before sending in for their offer of $630.  A friend who had used them said \"don't expect to receive what they offer.\"  Sure enough I received an email a couple days later saying they were lowering the offer as it did not meet their \"flawless\" category  Seriously?  The phone was as new and I even included the original box and accessories which were not even asked for.Not, a good experience so don't trust the offer you get."

At first they said it wasn't factory sealed in plastic so it can't be new. That iPhone doesn't come with a plastic wrap on the box. When I told them that I just looked it up on Google and there is no plastic they put me on hold and then came back and said it didn't have the white plastic screen protector on it in the box. Which I know it did I wrapped up the box myself and it was definitely there. So they dropped my payment amount by $180. I still agreed because they told me I would get my money within one day. Well they sent my money through Paypal and marked it as if I sold it through PayPal. No I sold it on gadgetgones website. So now I have to wait another 21 days just to get my money and way less than I originally agreed to sell it. This had just been a terrible experience and I don't suggest this site to anyone. It's one dissatisfaction after another"

They took 3 weeks to assess them, while trade-in values fell across the resale market, and then revised their offer down by 50% on every single dvice, for nonsensical reasons. For example, they lowered an offer on a 2019 macbook pro from $1350, to $480 due to a \"Battery in poor condition\". Battery replacements for macbook pros take 5 minutes and cost around $100, IF that, as apple replaces them for free quite often. This company baits customers by offering the highest prices for trade-ins on the market -- even higher than Apple is willing to pay - and then revises their offer down meaningfully once they have them in their possession. I'm sure the owner Patrick or one of his peons will respond to this review citing made-up hardware defects to justfiy this practice -- but just do yourself a favor and go with LITERALLY ANY other trade in service. If anyone has any questions about my review or wants to see receipts to demonstrate the truth of the interaction, please message me directly They also did an incrediblyh lazy job repacking the device I had them send back.Would give 0/5 if I could"

I got a decent quote from Gadget Gone, but was contacted and told that the phone was not in the condition I described and, of course, wanted to pay less for it.  I called them out on it and requested they return it, only then did they agree to pay the original estimate, which I accepted.  I had asked for a check by mail and received a check made out to someone else for about $10.00 instead of about $123.00.  I had to call back at which time they apologized.  Due to the inconvenience and delay, I asked them to PayPal the funds to me.  The \"owner\" contacted me and agreed to do so, but only if I paid the 3-4 dollars for PayPal vs mail.  I am amazed that a business wouldn't eat the few dollars for their mistake, especially after the attempted scam downgrade of the phone condition, but it's over.  It looks like others have had good luck, but please be wary of this business.  Kindest regards."

I almost didn't get the new iPhone because that phone was impeccable. I was very surprised to hear that upon their inspection, they said the main speaker did not work well and they were going to knock $300 off the price since it's \"damaged\". They stated they tested it using Voice Recorder. Well, I had often used voice recorder as well as speaker phone from across a room and knew it worked fine. They sent it back to me, and I promptly opened up Voice Recorder and it worked wonderfully. I don't know if it was a faulty test, or they have some impossible standard, but I have a feeling it was shady business practices. This experience with them was horrible, and I would not recommend them to anybody. I sent it to another phone trade in service once I got it back and it passed all their tests and I got the full amount paid for it. Trade in your phone somewhere else!"

Overall I\u2019ve requested to have my phone returned. It is not worth arguing. If it hadn\u2019t been for this Trustpilot review I doubt they would have provided any justification for their 40% lower quote.----Update: Received phone back.Their noted \"wear\" on the back is microscopic. Dishonest. It is so small that a high resolution iPhone photo closeup cannot show it. It is a barely colored small dot. No one would ever see any flaw there.More concerning, my flawless phone, when returned now has a bunch of light scratches on the screen that were NOT there before. This phone has always had a screen protector and screen was immaculate.Overall very disappointing. Reduced offer was dishonest at best."

I consider this a deceptive practice. There was never a mention about a battery needing to be +80% charge capacity, (Both phones charged to 100% on the phone), for the offer to be \"good\".  If they would have included that info in their pitch  then I would not have sent to them as ALL batteries degrade over time. Also read some reviews after the fact that people have not accepted their offer and were offered more money once or even twice. They seem to have a policy of lowballing you hoping you take it and if not they sweeten the pot. Kind of scammy really. Seller be ware!!!"

The images they sent back were of a phone totally scuffed and scratched that I struggled to believe it was mine (still up for debate!), so much so I sent the documentation I took right before I sent the device to them\u2014which looked flawless and had no scuffs or scratches\u2014but that went ignored. And this is where they have you cornered. After complaining about the outcome, they offered to send it back to me \u201cfree of charge,\u201d which was truly hilarious because the phone looked positively trashed at this point. Plus, logically it just seems like the shipment back to me would be the cost of restoring their initial quote and would be a win for all parties. Alas, that solution didn\u2019t occur to them. I had to eat the lesser quote, which I can only assume is exactly what they wanted. Anyway, I\u2019m your cautionary tale, so do with it what you will. But just know you were warned."

Yet when Gadget Gone wrote back they downgraded the original flawless rating I'd given it, because of supposed scratches on the back. I asked to see photos and was sent images of a scratched phone that could NOT have been the phone we sent (how does a phone get scratches when it's never been out of its case?). Their response time answering my questioning emails was very slow, too. From sending off the phone to receipt of the reduced check, it took nearly 3 weeks."

My quote was NO WHERE near what I was paid.  I was given reasons such as the microphone didn\u2019t work on one, or the SIM card slot wasn\u2019t working on another.  My $700 quote turned into around $150.  I had personally tested each and every phone before sending and packed them where as no damage would come.  There apparently were 3 that were activation locked and they sent those back.  I powered them up, reset them and was able to activate each one.  Just horribly disappointed in this company and will copy this review to other sites as to warn those who attempt to use it.

          "Contenu": "Gadget Gone was offering the highest amount for my phone when I researched who to sell it to. It is 3 or 4 years old but looks almost brand new so I claimed that it was in flawless condition since the categories are New-unopened, flawless, good, etc. They also ask if the phone is unlocked. When my phone is turned on it says T-Mobile but I bought it used online and it had been unlocked. I used it on Straight Talk and it actually ended up using an AT&T SIM card so I reported the phone as unlocked. I was told that, pending receiving the phone and inspecting it, my phone was worth $175. I printed off the prepaid label and sent the phone to them. After I mailed it I got a message telling me that instead of a few days on the turn around time they were actually running behind so it would be 7-8 days, which was ok with me. 10 days later I hadn't heard from them so I sent a message inquiring about the status. I got a message within 24 hours that after inspection my phone was found to only be worth $110 because it had a couple of blemishes and was not an unlocked phone. I asked for photos of these blemishes and explained to them that although the phone was originally a T-MOBILE phone, I had bought it unlocked and that they should have found the AT&T SIM card in it. The sent me photos of 2 scuffs that were so tiny it was laughable. I had to zoom in a ridiculous amount just to see them. Had they not circled them I wouldn't have been able to see them at all.They claimed these two \"flaws\" and the supposed unlocked status brought its worth down by $65 to $110. I again explained the unlocked phone situation and argued that the phone was at least worth the middle price of $145. They disagreed and offered to return my phone. I agreed that they needed to send it back. What they were looking for in a \"flawless\"  condition was a phone in which the plastic wrap had been removed from the box but it had never actually been taken out of said box. In their mind there is no difference between brand new and flawless so that price point is worthless. Had they checked with Straight Talk regarding the phone's number they would have found that the phone had been used with their company since I bought it. They took 10 days to tell me it wasn't unlocked. They could have taken 15 minutes to check on the phone's actual status. IF YOU DECIDE TO USE GADGET GONE TO SELL YOUR PHONE be advised that you will be wasting your time sending it to them if you have claimed it to be flawless and it has has ever been used. ALSO unless you bought your phone unlocked at the factory they will not agree that it is an unlocked phone. This company banks on you needing the money and overestimating what your phone is worth and once they receive it they use those assumptions to get you to agree to a decrease in what they originally offered. Fortunately I wasn't desperate for the money and I got my phone back and sold it to another company who stood by what they offered for my phone."

Pretty steep. Needed the phone gone so I did it and they did respond fast after that, but still won\u2019t be using this service again. Would not do it for anything that isn\u2019t perfectly flawless otherwise get ready to have your refund reduced. They did offer to send it back free of charge however so theres that, but seems like an inconsistent system they have based on the other reviews I\u2019ve read."

If I didn't know better, I'd say it was a bait and switch: \"Send us your item and we'll pay you on [date],\" became \"Send us your item and we'll pay you on [date + 2 weeks].\"I'll revise as the process progresses and concludes.Update:GadgetGone paid as promised.

No cracks, scratches, dents, nothing broken and software was working just fine. My assessment of my phone should have brought their highest rating and the  most money ($50) which they offered for a phone like mine.  After their \"technicians\" inspected it, they came back with a ridiculous statement that there was a \"white spot\" and they were only going to offer me $9! I found this really offensive and told them to send it back to me.  I then was told their decision would be re-evaluated, ,and after that they upped their offer to $30, which I accepted.  I think they try to pull this with everyone who tries to sell electronics to them. I do believe they are not unique ini this practice, and I understand they  tried to get me old phone for as little as possible, but nonetheless it did leave a sour taste in my mouth. My advice to anyone using this or any other service like it to stick to your guns if your electronics only fault is being old and NOT damaged.

          "Contenu": "Our family of 5 recently moved from Ohio to North Carolina, and specifically, to a region where Sprint coverage was non-existent. This necessitated us moving to another carrier, and we were unable to bring our phones as they were not compatible. I\u2019m a drug counselor, which is a highly fulfilling calling, but no one gets rich helping heroin addicts and their families walk through the hell that is addiction. I needed to sell our old phones quickly, and for as much as possible to help cover the price of our new devices and the start-up costs of the new plan. We sold four (4) iPhone SE (A1723) models, 9 months old to gadgetgone.com. I extensively researched this company, along with others. Read Trustpilot reviews and felt confident moving forward based on many positive reviews. My experience definitely did NOT match the substantial positive feedback that you see here. Hopefully my experience was an anomaly and yours, should you choose to use this vendor, will be positive and leave you feeling like a valued customer.I requested a quote online for my four devices. I received a quote for $340 total for 4 phones in flawless condition. My phones were purchased outright, brand new the first week of December 2017. Upon arrival, all four were immediately placed into their brand new Spigen cases. They lived there for the 9 months of our ownership. When I prepped the devices for sending to gadgetgone, I inspected them closely. They were each in incredible condition. I followed USPS tracking and saw that the phones were received by gadgetgone on Monday 8/27 at 1:33pm. Based on the gadgetgone website promise of communication regarding their receipt of my phones and a quote within 2 days of receiving them, I expected a quote by the end of the day Wednesday. I did not receive communication from gadgetgone of any kind informing me that they had received the phones. I did not receive a quote or communication on Wednesday 8/29 or Thurday 8/30. On Friday I received the following:Hi Jeffrey,Thank you for your patience while we inspected your devices. They work perfectly but unfortunately, they do not meet our mint condition criteria of being flawless. I have attached some pictures of the blemishes for you. Our quote for these iPhones would be $20 less than mint each, so you would receive a total of $260 for these iPhones rather than the originally quoted $340.Please let me know if you agree to this revised offer or if you need any additional information. Please remember that you are not obligated to accept our quote. We can arrange to ship your iPhone(s) back to you if you would prefer. Please let us know within the next 7 days. If we don\u2019t hear from you within that time frame we\u2019ll go ahead and send your check out for $260.Thank you!Mishelle, GadgetGone Customer SupportThis email was accompanied by 3 drastically magnified pictures under \u201cjewelers\u201d lighting of microscopic blemishes. You \u201cmay\u201d be able to unbox a stock iPhone and photograph it without discovering these type blemishes. No phone, having been unboxed and placed into a protective case could exhibit less wear than my phones did. That said, I responded immediately that I understood that their underwriting would not qualify these phones as flawless, so, I was willing to take a lower amount for the phones \u2013 but not the drastic discount of nearly 25% to their original proposal. I asked them to consider discounting only $10 per phone. This email received no response. I did, however, receive this email;Hi Jeffrey!I also found during testing that three of the iPhones with the IMEI numbers, 359143077011547, 359222071167917, and 359144079081322 have an unpaid balance with Sprint/Boost Mobile. In order for these devices to be eligible for the revised offer, we would need these balances to be paid off. Please let me know when you get that done or if you have any questions. Thank you!Mishelle, GadgetGone Customer SupportKeep in mind, that these phones were purchased outright, and then used on a Boost Mobile prepaid account. It is impossible to carry a balance on this type account\u2026 I had communicated this clearly to Mishelle during the quote process. I also notified her that Boost had provided the account numbers and released all 4 phone numbers to the new carrier \u2013 something they would NEVER do if I had any type of outstanding balance. Days later, I received this email;Hi Jeffrey,I went ahead and re evaluated your devices and it looks like there is no unpaid balance due. I apologize for the error! Your revised quote for your devices would be $260. Please let me know how you would like to move forward or if you have any additional questions. Thank you!Mishelle, GadgetGone Customer SupportI emailed her the following;Michelle, Thanks for acknowledging the mistake. Could you also clarify if you have reviewed my counter offer sent previously (see our message thread), I'm attaching it here again for your convenience:Thanks for the note and for providing pictures of the condition issues. I understand your grading, and am willing to take a smaller amount - but a reduction of $20 per phone is too steep. I would accept a reduction of $10 per phone for a total settlement of $300. If that is acceptable to you, go ahead and process the transaction via echeck.Between the excellent condition of the phones, the delay in initial response and the error on past balance due, I am hoping you can meet me half way on the price. Let me know as soon as possible, thanks - J.P.She responded that they could not do this and remain competitive. As I had been without the phones for 13 days at this time, and desperately needed to cover the cost of the new devices and start-up costs of the new plan, I grudgingly accepted this offer. Mishelle let me know that the settlement check would be emailed by the end of that same business day \u2013 and it was.So, here are my thoughts: *Every interaction with Mishelle was polite \u2013 that\u2019s always a plus. *I am convinced that, though they offer a \u201cflawless\u201d condition payout (as well as a \u201cnew\u201d classification), there is likely no actual flawless condition that ever is paid out. If my phones didn\u2019t qualify, I can\u2019t imagine where the line between flawless and new is drawn?? *I absolutely feel played by the bait and switch. No question, gadgetgone\u2019s initial bid was the highest that I found. However, the actual settlement, was actually lower than nearly all the other bids I received. Think about that\u2026 While I certainly was not forced to take the low bid, my circumstances \u2013 aggravated by gadgetgone\u2019s delayed responses \u2013 placed me under a bit of duress. *The unpaid balance scenario, combined with the lack of response to my counter-offer, certainly felt like a set-up to paint the low counter-offer in a more attractive light.Gadgetgone is definitely not a scam site. They have way too many positive reviews to even think that. However, those positive reviews absolutely did not mirror my experience. They did not live up to their own claims of responsiveness, payout or integrity. I would choose to work with another vendor in the future based on my disappointing and costly experience.***Update after response from Gadgetgone***I really do appreciate that Patrick Haney, the Owner of gadgetgone, takes time to respond to less than stellar reviews on Trustpilot. While it\u2019s true that most of his responses are \u2018let me show you where you were wrong\u2019 \u2013 it still deserves acknowledgment as he doesn\u2019t have to take the time to respond. Since you find me on a day where I am at my wits end with companies that overpromise, under deliver and then qualify their apologies with excuses, I\u2019ll engage.Ultimately Patrick, you acknowledge that, of my three issues, you failed on the first item, you failed on the second item, and I failed on the third item. Fair enough. You state in your response; \u201cWe strive to make sure every one of our customers have an exceptional experience.\u201d I don\u2019t buy it. Taking 20 seconds to send a form email stating that you indeed received my phones is not \u201cstriving\u201d, it\u2019s customer service at the base level. You didn\u2019t even achieve base level customer service. Understanding that a Boost mobile phone is not a Sprint mobile phone is not \u201cstriving\u201d it\u2019s basic information that a layperson can discover \u2013 let alone a representative AND the owner of company that resells iPhones for a living. That my phones were Boost phones was clear from my initial contact with your company.You are correct, I went back and looked at the flawless condition description on the website, and my phones did not meet that. Based on this, I will revise my feedback rating to 3-stars and remove \u201cI feel played\u201d from the review title.(Leadership training tip: That\u2019s what owning an error with integrity looks like.)"

Gadget Gone on the other hand, made everything extremely easy and even supplied me with the envelope and label to simply drop in the phone and send it in. Within a couple of week, I received my money. It was an easy and pleasant experience, especially since I received twice as much as I would have received from Back market which supplied me with the label to ship the phone but not the envelope.I would definitely use Gadget Gone again if I had an old phone I needed to get rid of for some cash."
