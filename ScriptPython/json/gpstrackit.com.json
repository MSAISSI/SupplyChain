Worst GPS service I've used of the 5 or 6 that I've seen."

In fact currently only 2 out of the 7 are working as I write this. I've spent 100s of hours on the phone with tech support, deinstalling, shipping units back, reinstalling only to continue to have issues. Tech support usually needs the unit back to troubleshoot which then requires more downtime and labor for us. So even after having their own certified installer reinstall all of our units we still continue to have the same problems on these units. Asked to cancel service and now they want me to pay $150 cancellation fee for each unit even though the units are not currently working and haven't for close to a year with all the issues we've had. Buyer beware with this company."

          "Titre": "Unsatisfactory Service & Unreliable Product.",
          "Contenu": "We have 3 GPS devices that our goal was to track mileage reimbursement & employees. The sales people at Fleettrackit promised me if we were ever dissatisfied with the product we could cancel at any time, no cost to us as long as we mail back the devices; I still have his email. We've had 3 solid months of the devices breaking down and not tracking miles, turning themselves off and on repeatedly while people are driving, alerting that they are unplugged when they are not, not tracking the correct time, etc. A few weeks ago one of the devices texted 450 alerts to my phone in an hour because we unplugged one so we could send another back. I always do exactly what the IT guys tell me to & when they can't fix it over the phone they send out a REFURBISHED unit (at their recommendation). Then I have to pay to send the broken one back and lose at least a week of mileage tracking. Most recently when I asked to end our contract the customer service supervisor suggested that they weren't really broken as they refurbished them and then sent them off to someone else and they worked. (Definition of refurbished?) When our original contract expired GPStrackit hassled me continuously to renew and I ignored them b/c even then I was questioning the service. They then went around me to the company president to renew the warranty...he renewed it, not realizing that he signed up for 3 years of unreliable service.  When I asked them to honor our original agreement I was informed the company was bought out and the sales guy that sold me the service no longer worked there so we would be fined and penalized if we broke the agreement. Then they tried to upsell me another product and I'm sure another binding service agreement with it.  These devices are now known in our company to be unreliable for tracking mileage, we can't use the alerts and the reports are mediocre at best. I have to export them to xcel and clean them up weekly.  I'm disappointed and frustrated with both the customer service and the devices. I wish I would've gone with any of the others tracking companies I had researched. I hate doing reviews and I'm trying to be fair. I gave them the opportunity to fix it and they wouldn't."

          "Contenu": "This complaint is generated for the \"ELD\" side of this company.  We have used this company's satellite tracking services since 2005 and have had stellar performance from those systems.  Additionally at no time have we experienced any 'rude' conduct, however we now submit the following experience(s) as being unacceptable, unreasonable and potentially exposing our firm to unlawful conduct as defined by Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.Federally mandated hours of service reporting via Electronic Logbook Devices went into \"phase in\" effect December of 2017.  We as a company purchased products to comply with the regulations December of 2016!  One full year before the mandated start period.  We gradually phased in a truck or two monthly to insure we had a fully debugged fleet before the December 2017 date. Beginning in July of 2017 and carrying forward to today's date has been a literal nightmare regarding the functioning of these devices and more importantly the inability of their technical services to make these units 'work'.  Our fleet consists of large truck year models 2004 to 2017 and we are experiencing as many problems with the latest models as the older model trucks.So far, just the professional man hours spent trouble-shooting, updating, upgrading, reinstalling, having units return from the field for this fix or that fix, send screen shots of reported problems, etc., has quadrupled our initial multi-thousand dollar outlay.As stated in a previous post, there were promises and assurances made by GPS Trackit that have never been followed through on.  In our case, these were not one-time issues, but presently number at 20 plus.  We are still experiencing problems that were first reported to the company in July 2017 AND still exist today despite numerous assurances from the company that \"this will be fixed\".  Today, I have 2 trucks properly functioning and 13 that are in violation of the requirements set forth in 49 CFR 395.  Should a roadside inspection occur, our company could be held responsible for the failures of GPS Trackit to correctly function/report. Federal law specifically places the burden of compliance on THE MOTOR CARRIER (US) to comply.  The most glaring deficient is the system does not function automatically as required by statute, but rather our drivers must physically enter data into the system.  The log can be manipulated EVEN WHILE THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION.  The ability to 'data entry' while the vehicle is in motion is strictly prohibited by the Federal Regulations and GPS Trackit should lose their FMCSA product endorsement over this issue, as they have known about this since July of 2017. Right now this Company has put us into a  Catch-22 position. GPSTrackit is either unable or unwilling to deliver a merchantable product AND regulators will find that we are not complying with all the requirements imposed by the hours of service safety regulations thereby exposing us to D.O.T. monetary fines and harm to our safety score.  Those in the trucking business know that purported safety violations remain on your record for three (3) years and affect your ability to do business and buy affordable insurance. Therefor we are presently examining what remedy would best serve our interest.As of this writing, there is no way we can endorse this firms Electronic Logbook Device rating greater than one star.  For those who have given this system 5 stars we can only say - We Wish We Were You."

          "Contenu": "+ GPS tracking that works decent+ Can set up Zones+ Power saving when home+ Scoreboard+ Light Weight+ Charges fast- All Zones have equal notification sound so you cant tell if its on a dangerous road, home, or just going from one part of the neighbourhood to another without having to check the phone all the time. Stressfull. - The GPS can jump to a location on the map when your animal is indoor/stuck inside some place to a wrong location and not register when it has left the place. Found my cat home one time when it said it was in a garage across the road. - No security warning if your cat is in a dangerous zone for the cat nor you. You have to manually go in to the app and start the sound on the GPS to try to scare your animal away and off when its off the road. And back on if he goes back. And off again if it returns to the road. - No power saving when battery is low so if it goes empty you can only see its last location. If it has left that location then good luck finding your animal if it has walked further from that. Gets a two star cause it works decent as a tracker, can hang sometimes, and has no safety mechanics to warn or if the GPS goes empty. Battery ok."

          "Contenu": "Bottom line up front: If you don't care about customer service and the user experience, this will do the job. Honestly, I found myself asking if this company actually exists at times. There are 3 phases I want to highlight:First, once they sell you their product, you are all alone. I understand that the sales team cares more about making their sales but they actually disappear once you sign the dotted line. Second, it's really surprising how every representative I spoke to does not pay attention to detail. When I first purchased the device, I attended their information session and had requested for the document via email, but I had to remind them couple of times to get a follow up from their team acknowledging that they \"forgot\". Also, in the process of closing my account, I had to speak to 4 different representatives who all told me different status updates. Funny enough, they all agreed on one thing: the other representatives were wrong. Lastly, when I finally received the return label, my address was completely incorrect so when I called back to have it fixed, I had to spend the first few minutes to convince the representative that I wanted to have it corrected. I understand that once the item gets to where it needs to, the FROM address does not really matter, but it's about professionalism and doing things the right way. She was definitely reluctant to assist and hung up as soon as she said, \"okay, I sent you the email\". Third, this is probably the most irritating one. Their user experience is TERRIBLE. Their mobile app would have been better if they didn't create one. You can read their reviews on the app store. They ignore all the reviews about the lags and how it freezes but they try to sell you with \"you can also track your vehicles using our wonderfully designed mobile app\". If they had any bit of integrity, they cannot claim that their app is working. It really does not work. I am not exaggerating when I say this. The app does NOT work. And they know it. And no, it's not my phone. Many of my colleagues who happened to use GPS Track It experience the same issue. Anyway, even their web design looks very outdated and looks as if they kept their pre-alpha version. All that said, if you really don't care about any of the customer service or the user experience, and you simply care about exporting a report then this will get the job done. For me, I value professionalism but this company does not.*EDIT*They charged me even after confirming that I have no outstanding balance and that I will not be charged since I closed my account before the billing date. I will definitely dispute this but just the lack of attention to detail from the start to end is so frustrating."

I think it was simply a matter of getting up the chain of command to the right person.  The person I spoke with took responsibility for the promises that were made to us and had the custom report designed for us entirely at their cost.  The report is exactly what we wanted and I couldn't be any happier.  I would give them 5 stars but I am grading them down for the prior problem.  I am now 100% satisfied with the product and service.  We were looking to upgrade our GPS systems in our trucks.  GPSTrackit was recommended to me by our Verizon Business Rep.  After talking with the GPSTrackit Rep and going through a demo with him, I sent him copies of the reporting that I was provided with my current system and was important to me.  He told me no problem with them providing me the same reports I needed.  I ordered their system along with tablets from Verizon and expensive mounts from a third party provider.  After using the product for a period of time I asked about when I would get the report I had been promised.  They said it would cost $3,000 for them to custom design the report.  I said but my Rep Omar promised me.  They said Omar no longer works for them.  Beware of false promises."

I've had occasion to talk with your tech folks several times.  Short or no wait times, call backs when they say they will (not normal), and quick solutions.  We have one potential hardware issue, but it's being worked actively. The software seems easy to use and was not difficult to get basically set up.  I was especially pleased to see that all the devices we ordered were pre-loaded and by using VIN lookup, I had to do very little in the way of configuration.  Not what I expected!I complain loudly about the generally poor tech support/service I run into all the time so I figured I should say something when it exceeds  expectations.Keep it up!"

Heck, even good customer service has taken a back seat to the need to add Quantity to the Rolodex, instead of quality.  This is not the case with the GPS Track It team.  From the day our company sat down for a demo of the extensive products and services offered, GPS Track It has been quick to answer our questions, been attentive to our needs and adjustments, and amazingly quick to respond to emails and calls when the occasional issue does arise, usually due to human error on our side.  We signed on with them a little over 6 months ago, and couldn't be happier!  We have a fleet of just under 100 trucks, in 6 different states, so the tracking of each truck, and new E-Log monitoring of every driver can be difficult.  GPS Track It makes it a breeze.  Anyone looking for GPS Service needs to check into GPS Track It.  My company has been with 3 different GPS providers over the course of the past several years, and none have compared to the service that GPS Track It has provided.  Do yourself a favor, and look into them, you'll be glad you did."
