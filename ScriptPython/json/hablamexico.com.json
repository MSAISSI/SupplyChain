When you use the online chat to ask them how it is you're getting MXN 389 credit for $10 instead of MXN 188 or so, they keep repeating that it's an ESTIMATE. When you push them to know what you'll ACTUALLY be getting before you hand over your money, the chat gets cut off.  This happened twice to me (talking to Mauricio) after he just kept repeating it's a computer estimate without explaining how the estimate is double the real rate and without trying to confirm the actual amount you'll get.  Can you say \"scam\"?"

          "Contenu": "I reload my Telcel phone with this app since I can never get the MiTelcel app to work. I never had an issue with loading the Telcel paquete Amigo. What I don't like is for the Saldo Amigo they state an amount in US dollars and Mexican pesos equivalent, and so my math is thinking they are giving me a really good exchange rate. I believe their website shows Monto Recibido: 1500 MXN; Cantidad Recargada: $50. I think this is misleading since I received 885.47 MXN for my $50 USD.Thankfully I live 30 mins away from Mexico and I can just go on the weekend and reload at an OXXO or Soriana, but just beware that you don't get what it shows on their site. I did reach out to their customer service asking for an explanation and checking if it was a currency exchange that changed that amount. Their response was: Telcel Saldo Amigo Mexico have confirmed that order  XXXXX was placed [date] at [time] for a mobile recharge has been successfully processed and the credit has ben added to the phone number you chose - XXXXXXXXXXXXX. [...] Please keep in mind that any dues owed on the account can affect the current balance. [...]I had no past due balance. Telcel Amigo is a prepaid service. I don't understand the discrepancy. I would still use this website to reload the Telcel Paquete Amigo but not the Saldo Amigo."
