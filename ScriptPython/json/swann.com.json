          "Contenu": "Bought Swann enforcer cctv 2 months ago. Spotlights on 2 cameras have stopped working after just 2 months. Contacted Swann who went through tech support - waste of time clearly a fault with the actual cameras as I have now found other reviewers with the same issue. Swann customer service and warranty is a joke luckily the manager in screwfix has agreed to change the cameras for us after Swann we\u2019re completely useless! Do not buy from Swann, product clearly has a common fault, zero customer service and unusable warranty!!!!Automated response just shows what type of company Swann is!! Follow up what communication I haven\u2019t received any!!!!"

I have a set of blink outdoor 4 cameras and these have better motion and video quality. I've honestly always wanted swann cameras but I had him higher expectations just for the simple fact that you guys are a leading brand in security cameras. I constantly have to keep closing and opening the app due to app freezing or becoming unresponsive. Camera constantly going offline for no reason. Internet signal excellent. I don't seem to understand what the issue is.  The App just doesn't work properly."

Ive had nothing but trouble out of them. The app is the worst app ive ever seen. I bought 3 cameras at 150.oo bucks a piece . Never do that again. I had to spend another 125.oo bucks on a Night Owl. Witch works great and has an awasom app. These people need a good sueing.... Not a good camera or app."

Unable to view cameras, notifications come though to say motion detected but then app says unable to view camera. Tech has checked our WiFi which is very quick, ensured they are set up on the right network etc and all is okay. On reading the reviews on the swann security app this seems to be a highly reported issue since the app was updated. Awaiting reply so I can return them. Cameras look good but not fit for purpose as the app is faulty and you can not view any footage."

From my experience, 3 systems and each system has failed cameras within 2 years and they are not cheap to replace. On my system I may as well spend the extra money and replace the system completely as two cameras are approaching half the price of another complete system....but it will not be Swann, that I can say for sure. If you want a system that is reliable then Swann is probably best avoided."

Well customer Services advised me yesterday that they would be calling me either yesterday or today from the UK...They even gave me the telephone number tey would be calling me from as I requested that because we get many unknown/spam callers and have to be careful when you are elderly. So yesterday evening I received an email from the technical department from a chap named Paulo? from his mystery location at GMT+11 ?? Which the last time I looked was not Greenwich near London.... On which email were a ream of questions about my time zone and could I suggest two different days and two diiferent times that I may be able to take a call??   Now if he was based in the UK (Say at the UK Milton Keynes address which forwards your call to the Philippines) Then I would apologise for suggesting they lie... however no apology coming and looking at all of the comments and complaints I have seen today on this site. I think I need not bother them any more. I will just download the copies of my chats and conversations and if I cn prevent one person having to go trough the trouble I have had, then hopefully that will be someone receiving a Security Camera system from a reputable supplier this Christmas... And on an even more sour note, I have received multiple advert from them via email to visit their black Friday Sale at their website. think there was an error on that email and it should have read come and visit our \"blacked out screen\" site.You know it makes sense!!!   Really Dreadfull and if a Manager would like to call, then please use the contact details that were supplied to you on Order Number 5116334..that is if your computer will let you have them."

The fact that anyone within 50 can search for a device and link up to it with a password is ridiculous. The safety of me, my wife, children, and animals are at risk daily. I have called and nothing has been done about it. My system is still being used by an unknown user within 50/80 ft radius. I have made serious considera to switch this year. It\u2019s unfortunate because I own eight Swann cameras. I should feel safe and I don\u2019t. Is there a resolution? I\u2019m not sure other than switching providers."

The idea of going wireless was to make it easier and the Swann camera was attractive in that it had a long battery life. I wish I'd had a camera hardwired in now. Battery life is roughly 10 to 14 days even with hardly ant motion triggers and linking back onto wi-fi and the app after charging is a nightmare, sometimes taking an hour or two of faffing on. On the plus side, the picture quality is excellent even in the dark. Overall, pay for someone to hardwire a camera in for you, it'll be far less frustrating."

When I figured out how to request a return online I had to have an active case number with tech support. Obviously this unit would not work. When I finally got through to tech support I had to argue/plead with the guy to give me a case number.  He kept telling me I was not talking to the right place. I kept asking how to talk to anyone else. He finally gave me a case number. So I finally could complete a request for a return.  Then I waited two days for the return authorization number. Finally sent it back and now waiting for the refund.   Will I buy Swann again? No"

My cameras that are in front oversee some traffic driving by and send an alert to my phone. My front property is not far enough away to not see the street traffic. I have checked and there is no edit zone for motion activity."

          "Contenu": "I\u2019ve been a 20 year swann customer, in the past 5 years, customer service has went to $&@/. I had 2 wireless cameras that for some reason swann decided to drop and totally disconnect and discontinued. My 2 were working fine until swann cut them out of their system.  Can\u2019t remember exactly how long I had had them but less than 2 years and swann offered me 60% off for 1 replacement camera, again I had 2, so I\u2019m supposed to get a discount to spend more money to replace. Next I broke my WiFi antenna and needed to replace it, I was told I could get 40% off other products, the antenna was $35 tax shipping all that bs, so I was going to get what $6 off. I personally think that my 2 cameras that were working were worth more than $6 ! So I didn\u2019t bother using my discount code, but I did call and ask hey, since I spent couple hundred bucks on cameras that swann discounted, why could swann not just send me a new WiFi antenna and I would be just fine with that, \u201cfree of charge to me\u201d $200 from me swann couldn\u2019t try to make me happy by sending me a $35 antenna. Yeah you could say that NO IM STILL NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT !! I\u2019ve set up my father\u2019s house with swann, couple of friends houses, and 3 systems of my own over the years, but now I won\u2019t be buying anything swann! When I decide to upgrade again which by the way is sometime this summer, it won\u2019t have swann written on it anywhere. I don\u2019t know what happened with swann but you used to have some damn great people there, now you\u2019re a greedy company that could care less about your customers. Thank you for sending me this review form so I could let all of your colleagues know how I felt"

You claim to reduce paper waste by not including a tiny installation doc but you send out dozens of basis papers in different languages - ?discrimination?. AND your packaging was way over the top and you could save thousands by not double and triple packing items.    Your agents were not very good but then you probably pay them peanuts  I shall be interested to see if you send me a non computer generated reply - the chat line was clearly computer generated and of a very low quality. just gave generic answers"

I tried again today and after many minutes of waiting on the chat, I gave up.  Finally, I got an email from \u201cJohn\u201d of tech support who seemed nice but the email process is painfully slow and I will have to figure out the problem myself or seek another vendor.Second note:  I called a live person who was very helpful and updated my camera software (v. 6.4.3 vs. 6.1.7) remotely and that solved the problem.  My suggestion is to speak to a support tech. initially."

Seems long until you add the distance down the wall (mine are 9ft.), and the slack (3ft.?) you need to the NVR. I needed 100 foot wire$ to reach my far corner$. My house is really not that big. I made it work. POE cameras are fantastic...software...not so much. Very cumbersome. I needed to cover some blind spots so I added a couple of hard-wired refurbs, and some Solar WiFi's. PC/TV is my preference for viewing, but you cannot see the Swann WiFi cameras on PC/TV...only on phone (Android/iPhone) app! I can now see 8 Swann cameras from my phone and only 6 Swann cameras on my PC/TV. Meanwhile my phone app times out on a security cam!!! \"Unamused emoji\". So, yes, I would still recommend this system, but be prepared to invest more than you originally anticipated to get the hard-wired solution you imagined."

As I am replacing an older system that has experienced a complete HD failure, I only purchased the CCTV recorder and not the cameras, as these are already installed; however, it looks like they are incompatible as they do not work once connected to the new recorder. I will try again to contact the support team for further assistance, but I may be forced to return the CCTV and get another one or get new cameras and dispose of the previous ones."

I also had to make multiple calls, with the automatic system hanging up on my several times.  One representative was supposed to order cameras she said were compatible but never sent the email with the order.  To sum it up, I had multiple problems and have given up on getting additional cameras.  On a good note, the cameras have a great picture."

Doorbell camera had initial set up issues and has a few flaws:  (1) lag between registering a ring and getting phone notification (2) video recording is too short and often cuts off part way through (3) sleep function renders device useless for a security device due to period between clip recordingsPan and tilt camera and auto tracking camera are good when they work but periodically disconnect from wifi.  Pan and tilt camera motion detection is a bit hit and miss.  Website point of sale also not clear that the device would not trigger through a window.No way to turn cameras off for privacy in the app or set scheduled on / off times.  Result is the need to manually switch them on or off and reconnect them in the app each time.App is slow to respond sometimes despite ultrafast broadband connection.Initial customer service contact via chat was ok but no contact recieved after case transferred for follow up."

While it does not claim to work in low light conditions, as a security camera I would have expected more."

Thankfully Swann supply extremely long cables so I was ableTo route everything to where I wanted it. You can also buy extension cables if you have more extreme lengths. After installing, it was a case of connecting the plugs into the cctv box, attaching a spare tv and the mouse and then working through the easy menu, followed by watching it all fire up. It\u2019s now been a year of use without any problems. One of the front cameras covers a good 20 metres. The system connects to my smart phone so I can monitor whenever I want and review previous footage without needing a tv monitor."

Door sensor triggered the siren and\u2026 the siren is a mistake. A bit louder than the alarm that comes from the camera but behind the door it sound like a toy police car. And again, sensor didn\u2019t trigger camera and camera didn\u2019t notice the movement. I will keep observing how the system work\u2026UPDATE: As of Nov 2023 the system works well. Other than above I\u2019m quite pleased with it\u2019s performance. I just love the app with Modes function and Live View. NVW-800 works silent and in comparison to Hiseeu I bought formerly It\u2019s bearly hearable. Overall 5/6."

I've had to replace two outside cameras for the same reason, they have screws that where not tight that hold them together in the back. This lets water in when it rains hard. I think they should have a rubber plug over the screws to keep the water from entering and rusting them."

          "Contenu": "This is my first security camera system.  The hardware installation was fairly straightforward.  The software setup was somewhat confusing and I had to read the instructions manual several times to get the desired settings.A mistake was made setting up the initial password and it was somewhat of a hassle resetting it, since the system is a standalone installation (I. e., no network, no Internet). I had to remove the DVR and temporarily install it on a network, so that it would have a MAC address assigned to it.  Once that was done, the password was reset and the DVR returned to the desired location.  I thought that was a bit much just to reset a password.  I guess the manufacturer assumed ALL systems are installed on a network; which was clearly not my situation.Anyway, I was able to get the system operating as designed.  I'm still trying to fine tune some of the settings.  This is taking a little longer then expected; but I'm attributing much of that to my limited understanding of how the system operates as a whole.I'm having to re-read some parts of manual to correctly apply the instructions, but I guess that's just part of the learning process."

          "Titre": "Almost a 5 star Review",
          "Contenu": "The package I bought was a solid value for the money spent. It is simple enough to put up a basic configuration. Where I feel it falls short is with the quality of the ethernet cables, they are wound very tightly and I had issues with 2 of them not working after spending quite a while to unwrap them and allow them to soften and straighten You should pretest them before installing them in a permanent location. The audio is acceptable in listening mode only and records at a reasonable quality. Using the microphone is a different story and only results in a horrible screech coming from the camera. I tested this on multiple cameras as well as on a different model camera and the results were the same. I tried disabling the audio on all but 1 of the cameras and had the same results. The app for IOS and Android are basic and sufficient for viewing/reviewing events but making config changes is not a current capability, however it suits my needs. The management app for Mac/Apple doesn't work. I have not yet tried to install on a Windows based PC. The system comes with a lot of features that if needed will require a fair amount of time to configure and tune to dial in the system to reduce white noise alerts and excessive recording, but this would be true of any system with advanced features. The 6k quality is excellent, I would take their advice and add a second and or larger hard drive option if recording multiple cameras in HD if you don't want archive more frequently."
