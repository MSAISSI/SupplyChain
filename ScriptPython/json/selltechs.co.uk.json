          "Contenu": "I sold my Apple Watch Ultra online to Selltechs, it was collected from my house, when Royal Mail tried to deliver it it was refused and returned to sender without explanation, I\u2019ve now received an empty envelope back with the contents missing, after speaking to Royal Mail it seems it was only insured for \u00a3150 for an item that cost me \u00a3819 and after finally getting through to Sell Techs they tell me it was only \u00a3100 which is a total lie. I\u2019m severely out of pocket and there\u2019s nothing I can do, After speaking to them once more and asking what they intended to do about it they replied take it up with Royal Mail and don\u2019t phone this number again, avoid this company at all costs! I do have the original box with the serial number so will be reporting the theft to the police."

I knew they weren\u2019t faulty as I tested them myself before sending them out and upon receiving my AirPods back\u2026. Surprise surprise they aren\u2019t faulty and work perfectly fine. Not only that, they also didn\u2019t send the extra ear tips back and they stole the ear tips that were on my AirPods. The customer service was horrific, it was like I was talking to a rude friend rather than an actual business. I will update my review if they send my items back that they stole."

          "Contenu": "It is important to keep in mind SellTechs recycle, therefore offering to buy your late model iPad Pro is a may not be in your favour and a waste of time and expense on both sides. If you are looking to sell a late model, in my case an iPad Pro 1st gen, consider battery health of your item, if you have used it well and the chances it is below the 80% needed to resell then Selltechs will not be for you. Mine was 69% and therefore deemed faulty. Other resellers will replace the battery for a compatible one, these retail at about \u00a315 so not expensive, the issue is taking them apart which is why I did not do it myself. I thought Selltechs would do this, otherwise why have an option to buy such a late model? It is in otherwise great condition and works well. But no, I had to pay for its return. Please do not use this company if you have an older model. Communication was not great, it still says pending on my account even though I have it back. I had to chase them after it being delivered, those that state they got a quick response are very lucky, I heard nothing for 6 days and only got a response when I chased them twice."

After days of silence I asked as per their own policy to send it to me but they wouldn't pay for postage contrary to their own t&Cs. When i recieved it the problem was their Internet wasn't stable so I set it up myself and sold to another company with no issues..The guy who answers the phone is probably the rudest person I have ever spoken to. A quick Google of the company shows a string of failed businesses. So beware.Use these people if you want incompetence, zero communication and anxiety.I can't respond to their response directly.

In the end I just used the supplied QR code at the post-office and they printed the label. Still had to buy a jiffy bag to put my items in though. The long and short of it is, just print off the label yourself or get the PO to do it via the QR code and you'll be fine."
