Go to a bike shop and sit on a bike. You won't be long finding a size that suits. It seems to me that you can not accept this as an opinion and instead you think it must be a misunderstanding. I went directly to trust pilot as they asked me to leave a review. You didn't. I think it's too expensive for what you get in return. Or am I misunderstanding?"

I have short legs and a long torso, resulting in very large bike sizes. E.g. Canyon recommends a size small, but Best Bike Advice recommends a size large with a very very long reach. I don't have confidence in buying the bike based on this fit.Taking measurements seems to be relatively simple, though help from someone is very beneficial."

I've put 196 miles on my bike with 93 miles based on the fit I received from Best Bike Advice. 40 of those miles were on XC single track in the saddle for 4 hours. I have to say that I am very comfortable and I feel like I can get a lot of power out of each turn of the cranks. I'm sure I may have to make some minor changes as I get more time in the saddle, but this is a great way to start. Being a licensed land surveyor I even brought photos of myself on the bike into AutoCADD to analyze my geometry. The fit I received is right in the sweet spot for saddle height, saddle offset, and reach from the saddle. The   bike fitting holds up for in the saddle comfort, as well as pure body geometry.This service is well worth the money in my opinion."

          "Contenu": "BBA takes all your important body MEASUREMENTS, plus riding style, fitness etc. (as inputs) to calculate FOUR key NUMBERS (outputs). These are intelligently designed, because:1. they tell you exactly how to SET UP the bike for optimal fit, and2. he deduces (tells you) the corresponding reach and stack (ranges) to help you CHOOSE a bike that will be a good fit.Like any modelling tool, rubbish in = rubbish out, so he explains exactly how to take all the measurements ACCURATELY, and tells how far they deviate from the AVERAGE for your height - with further advice (at the end) to ensure they are spot on.All the supporting DOCUMENTS are very well explained, in words and diagrams, and cover everything you need to know to adjust the bike correctly.He provides supporting TOOLS and information to choose the ideal stem, spacers, handlebars, etc. for your bike frame and fit.SUPPORT: I have untypical body measurements, making it harder to evaluate a new bike, so I emailed Jaap. He got back to me promptly with a most helpful and thorough reply.WORTH the money? IMO definitely yes: I had started by looking for a bike fit calculator that was free, but everywhere I looked I found only very basic tools which were of little use.By comparison, the extensive knowledge, thought and care that Jaap has put into BBA are evident throughout, and give me a high degree of confidence in the process and the numbers.I paid for the six months option (\u00a317.50), which I'm very happy with: It's a wonderfully useful service, and well worth every penny - esp. compared to the cost of a new bike, a face-to-face consultation, and/or fixing pain/discomfort when riding."
