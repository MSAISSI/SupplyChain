Instead they offered to send me free a replacement, but it turns out Torras does not make that item (\"Lstand\") for the iPhone 15 (non-Pro). They sent me the same Lstand plus another one that also didn't fit. I wrote a long email explaining everything and then they sent the Ostand which is the next level up, for free, which does fit and I love it.  Their attitude for making the customer happy was 5-stars, and the product is 5-stars, but they lose one point for not knowing their own product line and for not thinking the first time about what they were sending."

Works really well with all of my MagSafe chargers. Holds firm but easily removes from them. Buttons feel very nice. Made of aluminum? I chose the black case to go with my blue iPhone 15 Pro Max. Cons: Case is a bit slippery, Could use molded grips on sides. Maybe some slash indents built into the bumper? Stand doesnt angle enough for me to sit it on desk and look right at it. The ceiling lights reflect off of the phone face due to this. Buttons stick out too far. You will often will press them just by holding the phone or laying on its side using the kickstand. I've accidentally taken many screenshots due to this.I think this phone case could be everything I wanted if these issues were addressed. However, I'm keeping it as the pros outweigh the cons for sure."

We agreed that they would credit the first order and send me a new cover which they did. The cover it self are again a nice version that i actually will use going forward. BUT it still was a very long wait/shipping process AND i had to pay additional custom fee (same pris as a new standard cover in Denmark) why you need to order quit some covers before at can be justified. Due to thier customer service i update numbers of stars but cant see that it will make sense for EU customers.  _________I ordered an cover to my iphone14 which I received but they sent it for an MAX that is way to big for my iphone. Also I payed custom fee as I didn\u2019t noticed they was located in China. So the price doubled.  I sent an message trough thier website but didn\u2019t get any reply, sent an email with no reply and latest an messenger message still without recieving any feedback. Only reason why not 1 star is that the cover it self are more or less as expected."
