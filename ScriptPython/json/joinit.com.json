I did not initially set up the joinit database for our organization, so I have some learning to do. There are always different ways that members choose to pay, some even find old links and use payment methods that are no longer current. Some use failed credit cards and then cancel their auto rebilling and casue us headaches so the joinit staff helps problem solve with those. These databases are somewhat like a word processing program where there are many more capabiliities than a given user may be using. I am responible for maintaining the system and the staff have been very patient in their Chats online. I am still learning, thought bit by bit Ihope to become proficient. Een though they are not officially staffes on weekends, I was surprised that they did help me on a Saturday!"
