          "Contenu": "My laptop should accommodate an upgrade to windows 10; however, it will NOT handle the \u201ctool\u201d that is required to install the upgrade!  When I discovered this only moments after placing my order I requested that the charge be reversed. The company accepts no responsibility for the lack of information that lead to this pointless purchase. They want a screen shot of the error message and sent me instructions on how to do this on a Windows 10 computer\u2026 Duh, I don\u2019t HAVE windows 10\u2026 that\u2019s why I ordered it.  Not worth the hassle to try to recover the wasted expense. They basically assume that every customer is a liar and cheat. It\u2019s 20 bucks\u2026 Not hardly worth insulting the customer, but they did!"

          "Contenu": "This company can improve by giving you product keys that work for the lifetime of the product you have bought from them.  I bought Microsoft Office 2019 Professional Plus, Visio Pro 2019, and Project 2019 Pro from getpconline.com last February 9, 2022.  I was given product keys for all three of these products.  The product key for MS Office 2019 Professional Plus (8H3NM-G2HM8-CP2X2-HRTKK-P39GG) worked for only four months.  After the fifth month (July 2022), when I tried to use the Office 2019 Professional Plus, there was (and still is) a statement above the menu bar saying:Document1 [Compatibility Mode] - Word (Unlicensed Product)There is also a pink strip below the menu bar stating:NOTICE   Most features are disabled because your Office product is inactive.  To use for free, sign in and use the Web version.There was phone support last July, which is now no more immediately after the person chatting with me could not help me with the product key.  I was then told that she would forward my product key issue with an \"urgently needed support\" title to a higher support person to either help me with my key or to give me another key that would work.  I waited two weeks in vain.  I then emailed this company and was asked for my order number (which is 8234)  I emailed them my order number and sent the entire history of my problem with my product key.  I never heard from them just like I never got a phone call from them -- even when I called the number they asked customers to call, (318) 303-5593, just to get a voicemail promising that someone will get back to me.  No one ever does.It's too bad I cannot give getpconline.com a negative numbered review.  They stole my money."

They told me they could not deliver the product any other way and would not cancel my purchase nor return my money. I asked if they would put the download on a thumbdrive and mail it to me if I paid for the drive, the postage, and for the service, but they said no. I called my son who lives across the state from us and has cable internet. He downloaded the file, put it on a thumb drive and mailed it to me, just as I has asked getpconline to do. The only reason I rated them as 2 is that I was then able to get a d install the product. Thanks for nothing getpconline."

I was told that the key would be replaced with a working key - no refunds. I went back and forth with the person making sure I had an iron-clad statement from her since the guarantee was not on the website.I downloaded the software and installed it with no problem. So, I haven't needed to test the guarantee  . . . yet.  These licenses are sometimes very tricky. Some have a limited number of activations but Getpconline says the key is lifetime. We'll see. But so far so good."

          "Contenu": "After trying to purchase a Nintendo Switch as a gift, last year, from an unfamiliar online store (at a drastic discounted rate, during a Black Friday sale); which seemed almost too good to be true; sadly turned out to \"be\" too good to be true; the entire online storefront was a sham; and thankgetpcs to PayPal I was able to get my purchase monies refunded to me in a timely manner (and, PayPal was by my side through each step)! :D This experience, however, caused me to become very skeptical of future online purchases; stores, and especially sale prices or prices that seemed too good to be true.  With this being said when I came across getpconline.com I was VERY HAPPY and YET, VERY CAUTIOUS.I'm ELATED to share that my experience and purchase with getpconline.com was EXCELLENT!!! Immediately, I was reassured with the presence of an online customer service chat representative (so, I felt I could let my guard down just a little knowing there was a live person on the other end of the website) :D ... I did not use the customer service chat service, however, and proceeded to my purchase of a single item (a bit hesitant because the pricing was SO GOOD)!  The transaction was quick and secure and I had my product via download within minutes.The product contained an .info page (which, I'm assuming were installation directions; I also didn't use that; but, just pointing out that they were available with product purchase); I was able to navigate to the setup of my product and go from there.  During the installation, some computers may \"warn you\" of the file ... just bypass that and elect to go ahead and complete the installation and within a very short time frame you will have your purchased products on your computer/device (and, fortunately, for the product that I chose; I have that for LIFE; for a single product and device)!  Yippey!! :D lol :pI was SOOOOO HAPPY with their products and services that I purchased the same product for one of my daughters; and, I plan to go back to the site later today and purchase two (2) more of their products.The only question/suggestion that I would make/have is that it appears that they have strictly MS products which is WONDERFUL ... it would be nice to see products such as Quickbooks; Adobe products; as well, if at all possible.Best wishes to the company and its clients ... wishing you much perpetual prosperity and to the clients ... YOU ARE TRULY IN GOOD HANDS WITH BOTH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES! :D"
