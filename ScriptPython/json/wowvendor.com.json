When asking for a refund they were evasive, and when doubling down I was just told \"sure :(\". This site is obviously a scam and I doubt I'm ever going to see this money refunded, but steer clear."

I reached out on discord, and an associate did some research and said another character with a similar name was invited and completed the run and was able to see that it was in fact a mistake\u2026 which is fine, mistakes happen.  Here is the major issue\u2026 After relaying this info and recognizing the problem, the staff member said that since the run was completed for a different toon (not mine, no affiliation) that it was marked complete and I would just lose my money that I paid for the run?? Is this a reputable business or the mafia?? That explanation is comical, and I will just use one of the dozens of other services in the future."

Dude couldn't figure out the codes, repeated typo errors- probably high AF. Second booster did fine with the login. Before I ordered the boost, I let them know that it was -very important- that all my bars, keybinds and options settings needed to be put back to where the booster found them. After the boost was done, all of my bars and keybinds and options were screwed up. I contacted WowVendor, and the booster told them they had \"Technical Difficulties,\" so they couldn't change anything back (doubtful, yeah?) So the booster marked the order as completed and moved on without fixing anything. Unprofessional service from the booster on this order. After I complained about the settings problems, the booster said they were busy, and that it would take a few hours before they could correct their mistakes. Try again later. Will have to go through the login codes nonsense all over again. Bummer! Order #1182202edit: The customer service was again, excellent and they addressed my concerns afterwards, but I will add that the booster not only messed up my talents, he somehow OVERWROTE my other 2 talent builds. Had to rebuild my trees. Oof!"

I paid $109 for a level 60-70 power-level + an 8/8 mythic 0 dungeon run by a TEAM who would try to gear the character as close to a full set of 379 gear from scratch from those 8 dungeons. What I received instead was a auto-played power-level that took multiple days, and then a SINGULAR booster to run the dungeons on my behalf on my account BY THEMSELVES in PUG groups without even trying to armor stack. All I got from this $109 was a power-level, and a few purple pieces. The funny part is, the Customer Service Bot even admitted that there was a flaw in their description of the service on the website. They did not mention anywhere in the package that the 8/8 M0 run was going to be auto-played and SOLO in PUGS. I have screenshots of them admitting this. They even repeatedly mentioned the boosters as a \"team\" several times throughout the process, when really it was one single person lollygagging around on my account when I'm not home. You might say I'm a clown for spending $109 on a service like this in the first place, and you're probably right, but this was a big decision for me and I felt it was in the best interest of my time and entertainment value of being able to immediately jump into end game content, but what I got was severely underwhelming and not what was originally described for me. I can't even queue for LFR on this character lol. What a joke."

They are selling a run with the possibility to loot something on EACH boss. I understand that they may have a lot of demand but if the people leading the raid want to keep the loots for themselves then they shouldn't be paid to take people with. Either you take the money and offer the complete service or you just raid with your guild with noone to carry. I will certainly think twice next time i consider paying for help. And the way the service ghosted me afterward is conforting me in the idea that the quality of the service isn't there anymore. SHOULD PROBABLY TRY ANOTHER SERVICE."

Customer service responded saying their entire \"run team\" was in........ a storm with no internet connection? I said that was a lie, and they need to get someone out there immediately to do my run or I'm going to contest the charge on my card. FINALLY, an hour late and after demanding to get what I paid for, they managed to get people out to do the run with the 2 loot traders (which I had to make sure they provided because they likely would have forgotten).

If you do not purchase premium services towards loot, you will not just roll against other carries. You will also roll against the carry members. Such as one of their healers rolling and winning a DPS trinket, clearly a heavily geared DPS rolling and winning plate. Until the final boss which I have experience on regardless of my poor damage on a new character was when the carriers versus the carries were really determined as the whole raid rolled on everything they could, whether to sell separately, or to collude to piloted characters.I would HIGHLY suggest purchasing carries elsewhere, where there are far more clear lines on what to expect.

          "Contenu": "I primarily use WowVendor's raid services to gear alts and my experiences have been mostly positive.Recently, there were changes to loot distribution in WoW but WoWVendor hasn't adjusted their services to reflect these changes with regard to gear funneling and competition for loot overall.There are no cutoffs regarding roster slots for armor types nor main spec roles in the carries that make up a standard group. In the latest raid, this meant that I was rolling against 6-7 others for every piece of gear. Suffice to say, it didn't go well.The advanced option is still there but true funneling for gear type no longer occurs.That leaves the premium option but I cannot justify the price for content that will be obsolete in a little over a week.My other complaint is the sheer number of carries permitted in each run. Since most self-plays are relatively fresh toons, we are essentially dead weight. The fights are buffed to reflect the extra bodies and this means not only longer run times in general, but multiple wipes on the final bosses.WoWVendor generally offers great services but I think I will be taking on pass on their raiding options unless they update their practices."

I didn't receive an invite until around 8pm EST on Monday, that is after me having to contact the site. I was excited and ready to actually fight the Horde, however, the Horde never came...Crazy thing is we won an RBG because there was no opposing team....The customer service was great from the site. It was awkward because not a single person spoke in the raid group and no invites were given to speak in Vent, Discord, Skype, or Team Speak. I guess if you are looking for boring wins with no action, then buy runs. In the end I feel like they are not earning my funds, just a way of cheating somehow. I am fine with running my main with pugs and actually enjoy the action."

Problem is though that the discord person takes forever to respond.This is a difficult thing for me to do because I've used the services before and they were prompt with delivery. This is just completely inexcusable for a repeat customer and an easy way to develop a horrible reputation.EDIT to the reply:This site does not have a support team. Once you do try to contact them, they tell you to goto a different person on discord. Only problem now is that I can't talk to anyone on discord because I've been blocked. Great Customer Service.......EDIT 2:So they're doing their best to make up for the service. We've rescheduled. Until then I'll make this review a 2 star instead of a 1 star.

First chat with bella whisperwind, after my 2nd reply she took 30 min afk. I ask where she is after those 30 min. Waited mroe, and she left. Then I talked with Atalan or something. He introduced himself and says Hi, I copy pasted the convo so it was easy to get context and continue his parters chat. 10 minutes and DC from him too. Then, 3rd chat in 2 hours, I click Reconnect again after he DC-s. Now Nathan Fireheart or some similar name comes. I put it as simply as I can, third time. He asnwers last question and says vicious saddle isn't obtainable so it was removed. That's untrue and it's  come back since patch 8.1 after filling progress bar twice you get it. Now he claims \"its out of stock, it says so on the product.\". That is also wrong, the only description is \"slots left\" under price. Then i realise they havent updated the website in 2+ years since vicious saddle was removed from game. I ask why and he says They dont remove it when the item isn't obtainable anymore, and didnt update status eithere. only care to write review so other people dont waste Time and any normal person would be raging"

It would have been helpful if boosters were more proactive about giving real time updates such as when they logged off they could have given an update as to current level. Overall I would purchase again I think."

I'm giving 4 stars because in Aberrus the Shadowed Crucible, at least in Normal mode, you won't expect a raid group of 8 groups of people, which makes your loot options extremely lower than expected. Only in the last boss they kindly ask 2 groups to teleport out and make the fight with lesser amount of people. After beating it, those people leave and the remaining groups teleport back inside. So only on that last fight you'll get a decent loot option. They never said that in their website and that's a bit letdown."
