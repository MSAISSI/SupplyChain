          "Contenu": "I used Bunker to find the best value insurance for my business last year. This year I requested a quote for less coverage and was quoted almost double what I paid last year for less coverage. When I questioned them about this, they just said the carrier I used was replaced. I\u2019m sorry but that simply isn\u2019t a good enough answer. On top of that they simply didn\u2019t respond to my emails when I pointed out a massive difference between what I was quoted and what the new carrier came up with. When I called, the guy I spoke with was not accommodating and was not even apparently capable of editing the coverage on the quote. I was able to find a slightly better insurance policy for half the price elsewhere. My advice: go directly to the main carriers they work with who will be more flexible and responsive in customizing quotes or try a different broker altogether."

I carry liability insurance already - a million dollar policy - and pay $211 per year, because I am low risk.  I am not a mechanic, perform construction, etc.  I am a technical writer.  I also pay $65 per year for helicopter evac in case I get injured when I am out hiking in the middle of nowhere.  In contrast, Bunker charged me $211 for three months of coverage.  This is a scam, but if you have a client who requires liability coverage with them as the beneficiary you don't have a lot of options.  The best thing you can do is charge the client back for the cost and write it off your taxes."

          "Contenu": "I've used Bunker for years.  In the past, someone would answer the phone or return calls quickly in order to have a conversation with you allowing you to easily get a policy, renew a policy or have questions answered.  This created a very personal experience and made the customer feel important.This last experience required five days to get my policy reinstated.  When I called and someone answered the call, they advised to send an email instead of attempting to resolve the issue,  If calls were not answered by a human, you could leave a message which was returned four to five hours later or the next day.  If something was done incorrectly and required follow-up, it was another four or five hours for a response.  I don't have five days to wait by my phone for Bunker to return calls.  When a client requires proof of insurance, five days is to long to wait.   It appears that at least some of the staff is very competent and hopefully this is just a temporary manpower shortage that Bunker is correcting.  Bunker needs to get back to the previous level of customer service they provided."

They only provided me one option with one price point, but I guess that is what met the requirement for job. Communication was good and each individual step was quick, but every step was a 24-hour turnaround so the whole thing end to end took me a full week. It was 1 day to ask for a quote, 1 day to get the quote back, 1 day to clarify an item on the quote, 1 day to finalize the quote, 1 day to get the invoice, 1 day to confirm the invoice was paid, 1 day to wait for the insurer to process it, and 1 day to get the final paperwork. I was expecting I could get a quote and purchase insurance instantly within a few days max because it seems like a pretty canned offering. But at least i know I got the right insurance. I would not have worked with Bunker if I wasn't referred and probably wouldn't use them again unless someone recommended I use it for the job."
