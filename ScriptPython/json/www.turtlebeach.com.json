          "Contenu": "Son\u2019s headset split just shy of 10m of having the product.  I took them back to GAME who said that TB don\u2019t class this damage as a warranty claim, only issues like the mic not working you can claim, so I told them to recycle them.  I then contacted TB, who to be fair did get back to me, but said they can\u2019t replace unless I have the headset, which I don\u2019t and told them I didn\u2019t, a pic and receipt is not good enough apparently.  These cost \u00a3100.  Bad customer service, go for another brand if you want a quality product.After the reply from TB, maybe they should educate the retailers of their products that damage like this IS covered therefore would be able to send the item back.TB- He\u2019s purchased a much better set from a better brand with better costumer service than you."

They will replace with the same headset again which will just break .....again for a third time.  Customer service is extremely slow, and only through email."

I came across 2 numbers (one of them rang through and the other did not connect). The only way to have the item repaired is to submit a form online which I did roughly 2 weeks ago, it took them 6 days to reply to my E-Mail asking for further information. Over a week later I have still not heard anything back from them after trying my hardest to speak to someone concerning this. \r My 3 month warranty is about to run out and I fear I will not be able to have my headset replaced. \r I certainly will never buy a Turtlebeach product again."

I boxed it all up, attached return label they sent and mailed it out. All within return holiday period. Only after they receive return do they start sending replacement.Finally got replacement. IT WAS DEFECTIVE! This one had a broken microphone right out of box.Contacted them again. Despite this is 2nd defective item, they still make you jump through hoops.- what is serial number- send us picturesThen you need to ship back.When asked to speak to superviser,  rep actually said that was not necessary. Like what? Who responds with that when a customer asks for a superviser.Rep says will expedite return, and will go out as soon as return is scanned as dropped off at UPS.Needless to say, item was dropped off, and 4 days later still nothing mailed out to me. Completely lied about expediting.  Still have not received product paid for for Christmas for my son.Also now rep said superviser will call me. And got no call. Also called Turtle Beach last week and was told superviser Malcolm would call me.Got no call.This is the worst company I have ever dealt with."

I looked on your website and nothing regarding that is mentioned anywhere, I had to go to Reddit and other forums and find out that is a common problem with your equipment.  My mistake was not returned to the headphone to store the same day and I believed that It will be fixed in the future but no, 4 months later the problem persists, despite all the firmware update. I will not recommend your equipment to anybody, sorry for that but I found that a cheap wireless Chinese headphone ($40) works much much better than your Stealth_600X_Gen2_Black with the Xbox Series X, and that is not acceptable."

I have used this product for over 10 years and spent $1000's with turtle beach.

Try playing CoD while this is happening... Also, the right side ear muff broke off while taking the headset off one day. I have never been one to be rough on my equipment. The headset broke where it is supposed to extend or retract to help fit your head. Only a wire remains keeping it together. It's plastic, I get it but c'mon man...I had a set of Afterglow AG9s for 2 years prior to these. They had their own minor problems but I wish I would have purchased those again instead of these.

So your entire \u00a3200 investment on a headset is dependant on a cheap cable not breaking, If it does then you lose your headset like i did. Customer Serivce on twitter and on email just repeat, sorry we do not sell those to customers in europe. BE FORE WARNED AND DO NOT BUY THESE HEADSETS as they do not offer spares or repairs unless in warranty. Once warranty is up your headset is worthless, Id reccomend avoiding these lowlife. I offered to pay any amount for one or for repair all at my cost and was told no were not interested we wont sell you one or fix it. They should not be allowed to sell expsive headsets in the UK when they are discriminating aginst the UK market and not selling spare cables but they will sell them to you if your american, thieves"

Over the next couple of month they kept making excuses about EU stock that had to be replenished, and when they said that had happened, the new headset would be sent out any day now. Halfway trough May they stopped communicating at all... I've logged a new complaint and send them a new email on their company address after that, but no response so far... I've been selling their headset during my previous job as a gamestore manager, and always thought of them as the highest quality products someone could get. But this is ridiculous... Very disappointed. At this point I'd even settle for getting the broken one back (even suggested so in my last couple of messages that I got no response to) and try to fix it myself. If anyone has any suggestions how to put some pressure on them? I'm even considering creating a Twitter account just for this, as someone below mentioned that seemed to get their attention..."

          "Contenu": "To anyone thinking of buying Turtle Beach I have one word - don't. The reason being is simple - they're very cheaply made with cheap materials. I had my elite pro headphones little over six months before they started falling apart and I've had to return them to be replaced. Fortunately, they offer a two year manufacturer warranty but that warranty doesn't reset when I receive my new headphones. I play online and have plenty of friends that also have the elite pro headphones and have also had the same problem. Also, if you search for Turtle Beach on Twitter you'll see many others with the same problem. I wouldn't be so bothered if it was a \u00a330 product, but it's a \u00a3150 product and you expect more for your money. Clearly, it's a cheaply made product. While I'm happy TB are replacing my headphones for a new pair, I've already made my mind up that I'll never be buying from this brand again. I'll probably buy Sennheisers in future, as it's a brand I trust that's been making headphones for a lot longer than Turtle Beach. I made a mistake buying these headphones, don't make the same mistake I did."

They continued to email her 3 times in a row. He said he was going to deal with it himself. He was on his trip with bad reception so he was going to come home which was going to be 1 week and talk to TB. He got home and talked to them and I sent the headphones and the serial number in a box and shipped it to TB somewhere like missouri or maine whatever MS is. So still havent heard back from them. Shipped it like 4 weeks ago and first called them 1.3 months ago. Just dont buy turtle beach. im going to just buy some other brand thats not going to break within 3 months."

GOOD:The headset is somewhat comfortable with plush memory foam ear pads. But it does have some clamping force, so if you\u2019re someone who has a large head don\u2019t even bother as it will literally give you headaches. MEDIOCRE:Turtle Beach Audio App is ok when it works and there seems to be a lot of bugs with it. Bluetooth disconnects randomly and the options you have in the app is not anything great. BAD:Whilst the sound quality in general is just ok, all this marketing about competitive headset is definitely rubbish. This headset is nothing like their old Elite Pro 2. Although that headset is wired, but the sound quality and superhuman hearing was great. With the 700 Gen 2 headset it\u2019s awful and I do not recommend it to anyone who cares about critical sounds like footsteps and any other subtle sounds in FPS games, especially Warzone. This headset would be worth it at \u00a380 and there are much better wireless headsets out there. I really hope they\u2019ll make an Elite Pro 2 wireless version someday, but they really need stop with this app support and maybe introduce a desktop dac option like SteelSeries."

          "Contenu": "First time buyer directly from Turtle Beach website. Customer support takes a very long time to reply to emails. I appreciate the Covid-19 outbreak has affected lots of operations in most businesses. However, I can't see the number of emails received by Turtle Beach to be that much to cause delays like a whole 10 days or more to address customer issues. The other problem I experienced was whoever read my emails and I'm guessing a different person each time, was not reading properly and replied with requests that was already in my emails. Then another issue was lack of communication between their depot and customer service. I mean after all it's a retail company that sells products aimed at one particular market, so how hard could it be and it's not like it's the biggest company in the world with 100 different departments. You get the picture. Of course this was my experience as someone who purchased from TB for the first time and I value experience therefore, I would not purchase from their website again. The only reason I didn't give just one star is, I can recommend their Elite Pro 2 headset with amp easily to anyone. It's awesome and with the superhuman hearing it's ridiculously accurate with imaging, especially when playing FPS games. Only 2 downsides for me were lots of wires running across my living room floor, which was a death trap and the Bluetooth connection was quite unreliable. So if you're a desk gamer and TB makes their Bluetooth connection with the TB hub app more reliable then I can easily recommend. If you're a living room gamer then go for one of TB wireless options. But I would highly recommend to purchase from somewhere like Amazon as they usually price products cheaper than official sites and their return process is amazingly easy or simply if you haven't got a budget and ok with spending around \u00a3250-\u00a3300 then go for the SteelSeries Arctis Pro with game DAC or Pro Wireless. Omg they're simply the best."

This was the second pair to snap for me in less than a year and I\u2019m guessing when this pair breaks I will be out of luck since it will be more than a year since my original purchase.  I will not be spending more money on Turtle Beach if nothing has been done to address these issues, even though I love the headsets."

Your replacement was shipped today, if it doesn't come by Friday let us know and we will ship another... This went on for three months. Finally I had enough and asked for the details of someone else I could talk to. Waited three days for the reply, this time they said they had shipped my replacement that day but they also provided a tracking number with UPS.I highly doubt I was sent six pairs of headphones that all got lost in the mail. These people lie to you and lead you on for as long as they can get away with it. Will never buy from them again.Update - When I finally received my replacement it was an almost like for like exchange.

The noise cancelation isn't great because when you have it maxed out you will get a buzzing noise so I'd advise to not go above 50%. The battery life is what made this a 4 star review because they say 12 hours per battery but in reality it's around 9 hours. So would I  recommend these? Yes I would they're very good."

As I am still waiting for that second email I have replied to the previous automated email. That only asked me to reply if my address was incorrect so I have replied that it is correct. I will gladly send the pictures of the damaged headset as soon as the second email arrives. Thanks again.2nd Edit: 30 min later still haven\u2019t received any new emails.Reply: hi there. I\u2019m unsure as to why I\u2019m not receiving ur emails. As I got the first initial one from weeks ago. I\u2019d love to be able to speak with someone in regards to giving u my email to try and help move things along. Or even speak with someone over the phone. Should I just keep replying to the automated email that asks me not to? Thank you I\u2019m advance from any information you can provide me. I just hope I did it right this time lol"

I was hesitant to contact them recently but found the support exceptional and speedy. I've been using turtle beach for 14 years and will continue to purchase their top tier models. If you haven't tried them, I highly suggest you do. Investing in a high quality headset will change your gaming forever. Don't get suckered by some random streamer into buying another brand who's new to the game."

I contacted Amazon and thats where it became difficult, as the call centre was in India, it was difficult trying to explain to them. They just kept telling me that the 30 day return window had expired and that they could not exchange. I kept going around the houses with them, making no progress. Frustrated, I contacted Turtle Beach and explained my disappointment. Without hesitation Turtle Beach authorised delivery from their own warehouse of a replacement headset. The headset arrived this morning and is the latest version of the model we purchased last year. This is how customer service should be. Turtle Beach clearly care about their reputation and value their customers. Thank you Turtle Beach Customer Service."
