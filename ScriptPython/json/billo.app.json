Can't change dimensions once I've placed an order (not sure why). Customer service is terrible, and they take forever to respond. In the end, the video I received was pretty low quality. Asked for a refund several times and can't get one because, by the time you realize this service sucks, they've closed the refund \"window\". Second creator ghosted me and never sent a video and I had to hound them for it. Stay away."

I had a script, I explained exactly what I need from her and also I showed one ad from my competitors to the creator so she could understand exactly what I wanted from her. And the result was her showing just her face moving it up and down and the script was illustrated with voice-over. I never asked her to do voice-over instead I was expecting her to talk to the camera. And customer's service reaction was she has to give an honest review. And the creator's response was I can't remember the script by heart! What is this??????????? Are you kidding me??? I have asked the support either for a refund or some other creator to do the job that I asked!"

I was very frustrated as I have a business to run and I needed these ads. I am very busy and haven't got time to chase people up. None of these creators marked it as delivered, I chased them up and some had an excuse about not being in town, which if I knew this, I wouldn't of picked them for my videos. Some marked it as delivered when I chased it up.3/5 of the creators delivered great videos, no doubt about that!One of the creators was making so many mistakes, and put little to no effort into his video.The other creator we are STILL WAITING for the video for and it's been over a month since I placed the order.I mentioned my issues to billo customer service and all their response in summary was 'thanks for the feedback' disgusting.Honestly was looking for a long term partnership but that's not going to happen anymore."

We purchased on Tuesday afternoon, and didn't hear back until 4pm on a Friday.If you are a company that is trying to create a serious video ads/marketing plan... consider other options.  The level of communication is unbelieveable.  They said that one of their manager's called in sick.  I guess that says a lot about their leadership structure.  To be fair, I did get 1 video that is usable, but not at all like the 'samples' they showcase.  Good luck!"

Out of the 5 videos I requested, I've only received 4, 2 of which were the same video with a different voice over. The content creators did not seem to have any guidelines or deadlines, one of the content creators delayed making a video until I had to ask 4 times, (3 weeks after receiving my product). None of the content creators post on time, and there was no consequence on Billos end - all of the creators delayed making videos (alarming since I ordered from 4 different content creators). Save your money and go elsewhere, there are far better services for this price. They charge an arm and a leg for these services, promising you a 5 day turn around time, but its been a month. To date, it has been 1 month and counting during a busy Q4 season, and im still waiting for these services to complete. Spent over $800 for subpar service, and responses. After I explained my issue, I was given a 15% compensation for my next video  - when on their website they have a 50% off promo right now. Insensitive and completely missing the mark on customer service - offering me less than the current public promo."

          "Contenu": "I can only thank myself for not going ahead with the $2500 package. I never bother to leave reviews but this experience just compelled me to. The intent behind this platform might be good, but the execution is poor and the customer service is poor with no communication on live chat and responses do not come until within the next 24 hours. This is a poor experience given how even smaller apps on Shopify provide instant communication.Now about the experience with the creators. We got the 3+1 mashup bundle and identified 2 creators to start with for 2 different tasks. Firstly their pool of creators are either too small or only certain type apply for a certain type of products, so I had pretty much the same creators apply on all my tasks and not enough of them applied. And it is not that it is a cheap product or won't appeal. Most of the ones that applied were not worth it anyways. We chose to nevertheless work with 2 separate ones. One of them was just terrible with such poor audio and video quality, and this was despite it being passed through billo's audit before being presented to the client. Their standards must be so low that they even allowed it to be shown to me. The whole process is so slow, we sent the products in the first week of Feb, and now in early March we still do not have videos to speak of. Brands cannot work like this with this kind of ridiculous timeline. When we raised the matter of the poor video and audio quality of the creator, the support agreed that it was not an acceptable quality and offered credits to place another video, but stated the product amount would not be refunded. So basically, a content creator fails to deliver as per the requirements, fails to follow the brief, provides poor content, and because they cannot do the job right, they get to keep the expensive product for free. We not only lose time, but we also lose the product amount behind a creator who cannot even offer what was agreed to.In the second order, the creator gave us content with elements missing from the original brief, it has been 5 days, and still no update on the edits requested. They might offer better value with creators applying for your tasks to make life simple, but the very intent is missing when they cannot deliver at every step. There are alternatives around or just work hard directly with creators, because the content here in our experience isn't exactly how it is promised."

In this short amount of time I was able to complete almost 300 videos and earn over $10,000. I enjoyed creating, and even received personal requests from brands to work with me specifically. I fell sick and was hospitalized after this time, and Billo suspended my account. I still worked from the hospital, but Billo never chose to unsuspend my account when I returned home, and informed them of my situation. They forced me to pay money for products that I never received, and never paid me for the videos and advertisements that I did complete.My problem with Billo is that the customer service team treated me horribly, and stole money from me.From day one, they constantly suspended my account for things that I did not do. One of the consultants told me that they specifically went and told other colleagues not to put me on tasks. As a black woman, it is already difficult to find work in the influencer/creator space, and Billo\u2019s team constantly lied on me to brands in an attempt to hold me back.I sent a message in the app letting Billo know my problems, as well as leaving a comment on their Instagram page, and all they said was sorry. I have been trying to speak with a customer service representative for two weeks now.I am willing to give Billo another chance, because I am great at my job as a creator, and I put a lot of energy and work into my content, but I have not been able to speak with a customer service representative. Brands have reached out to me via my social media pages to complain about the negligence of Billo\u2019s team, and I can only agree with the lack of integrity and customer service.It is unfortunate and despicable that Billo treats their creators (especially one that has brought them so much business in so little time) in such a poor manner. The creators are the backbone of the brand, and without good creators, companies would not ask for advertisements. I even referred friends to use this app to make extra income, and I am now regretting doing so. Billo always states that they are trying to improve, but when asked for those improvements, they do not help. As one of their top creators, it is very unfortunate that I have been treated like this, and after speaking with a few of their smaller creators, I can only imagine the stress they go through. My Instagram is @KimberlyIreneFowlkes, and I am still waiting to speak with someone about my account, and receive my compensation for the work I completed. I hate that I have to leave a negative review, but I am not satisfied with the services of this app."

          "Contenu": "From a Creators POVAs a creator, I was really excited about using Billo. I had been on their platform for over a year, but finally opted to delete my account with them today. They had issues on and off since I 1st joined them, some were resolved while others, such as their customer service only got worse. So I guess I'll break it down:1) LOW PAYWhile Billo starts at $59 for brands, creators only make $15-$30 per video. Considering the amount of work involved, the pay rates are pretty low. However, sometimes the item you get from the brands can help offset the cost, but in more cases than not, it does not. Additionally, a lot of brands have a lot of requirements for such a low payout. Now, from their end, they are paying a higher rate, so I could see why they would have a lot of requests, but from a creators stand-point, it's a lot more work than it is worth for many items. Personally, I would avoid such tasks. For the low payout, I would look for the simplist job.2) NOT PAID FOR EDITSOn top of a low pay, there is no additional payment for edit requests. I'm not talking about if the creator makes a mistake, but in the brand wants more voiceover, more scenes, etc. So basically, they want to force the creators to do extra work at 0 pay. Around when I first started, they would at least add on an additional $10, but as I recently found, they are no longer doing that.3) NO WAY TO DIRECTLY COMMUNICATE WITH THE BRANDAs a creator, I may have questions on how to pronounce something, how it is used, etc. I have NO way to contact the brand to discuss anything. I have to go through Billo. Which leads to my next issue.4) TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE & RESPONSEAs a creator, if I'm trying to complete my tasks, it is important to get information as quickly as possible. The response rate is poor. Sometimes you get a quick response, however, if something is an issue, it seems they can take days to respond or simply they ignore your message unless you basically end up harassing them. I've had quite a few times where I will see that my message was 'seen' however, not get a response for another day or longer. If you saw my message, why not respond? I hated the idea of deleting my account. I love trying new things and getting a few extra dollars, but the treatment by Billo makes this feel like slave work. They make creators look bad to the brands. I've seen so many brands complain about creators, and to be fair, some I am sure are justified. However, the length of time it takes to get their video, lack of quality, etc, I blame a lot on Billo because of their response rate. For example, I upload my video within 24 hours of receiving the item, I submit my video. It then has to sit and wait for Billo quality control check, then if THEY think it needs edits, then that's another wait for the edits to be done. It can take DAYS before their quality control check and more days if edits are needed, before the brand even gets to see the video. So it may look like the creator takes forever, when in fact, at least in my case, that is not so.Between what I'm seeing other creators say, I'm finding that it wasn't 'just me' - but how Billo treats creators as a whole. And quite honestly, the complains from Brands, I don't blame them either. Overall, Billo really isn't worth it for either side. Great idea, poorly executred. I am now offering my services outside of Billo so I can work directly with the brands rather than using a \"middle man\" who doesn't care about either party.UPDATE 10/19/2022Just updating, I was willing to give Billo a 2nd chance since they claim to have improved. Apparently, it's the same terrible environment with terrible customer service. If you're a creator, go on another platform to avoid disappointment and stress."

          "Titre": "Terrible Communication with Creators",
          "Contenu": "I am a Billo creator and have been for a year. Many of my experiences have been positive and I refrain from complaining publicly because over the course of the year, it appeared that Billo was committed to making changes that made the service a better experience for creators and I like to give companies the benefit of the doubt. However, over the past year, there have been grievances that have really made working with them more stressful than need be, and instead of fixing these concerns, I've recently been suspended as a creator. My major concern is how their support team communicates with creators. There isn't consistency in how we are alerted that we have been confirmed to create a video for a brand, and they rely on the system's documentation on when I should receive a product vs when I actually do receive a product. In addition, their customer support team don't seem to be on the same page or read previous notes before making decisions on an account. It's only happened a handful of times where a product will not be delivered on time (which has been an issue  during this pandemic) but then Billo's system will document my making of the video as late even when it's not my fault. I have been overly communicative and keep them updated on my tracking of the product, including screenshots when needed and they still mis-document this. I usually alert them as soon as I see that it shows up as \"arrived\" in my account and this is not correct. So as a result, I have sometimes been incorrectly removed from the product. In addition, I will be told not to worry by one representative but then threatened to be suspended by another rep which had gotten pretty stressful. In the past they've apologized for these errors and have corrected the mistakes and so I felt no need to make a public complaint.In this most recent instance, I had applied for a product but had not received confirmation that I was approved for this product and so after a bit of time, I'm not expecting it. In addition, I never received an email alert about this product approving me. Eventually, I was confirmed for this product but I had to move last minute for a gig out of state. So I was no longer living at the original address but I updated my address that day. However, I noticed in the app that the product was now confirmed, which felt odd because I didn't receive an email. After looking at it some more, I realized that they just confirmed it that day, the same day I updated my address. I reached out to the Billo support team IMMEDIATELY when I realized that the brand could potentially be sending this to the wrong address. I asked them if there was a way to track this. They responded to not worry and to just wait to see if it arrives. (odd, right?). Eventually, I followed up with them to ask for tracking and they were able to provide it to me, and yes, it had been delivered to the previous address. I advised them of this in hopes that we can reach out to the Brand right away, and they instead, asked me to get in contact with the previous address to see if it could be delivered to me. I was super hesitant about this as I didn't think this was a professional, nor safe way to handle this. I also addressed my concern to the Billo team that I'd be asking someone to deliver this to me on their behalf that I might not want to even know my address. Their response was just that they'd reimburse me for the delivery. So eventually, I was able to get a friend of mine to meet the person at the address to then deliver it to me. This took some time, because everyone's schedules did not align. I kept Billo informed of this whole process and updated them whenever I got any updates on this process. They continued to make me feel as though it was fine and time was not an issue. I even suggested, perhaps they have the brand re-send me the product so that I could shoot it right away and then send them back the original product when I could finally receive it. Eventually, the product was shipped by my friend, but it hadn't arrived yet. However, Billo then advised me that the Brand had removed me from the product and that they were suspending my account for a late video.This was a shock to me, considering we had been communicating thus far, and this felt like it came out of nowhere when they knew I was still waiting for the product. The product eventually came, and I advised them and they said that it was too late. The Brand didn't want to work with me.To me, this goes to show that they didn't properly communicate with the Brand about what was going on, but also, to be punished for this was totally unfair to me and I voiced my concerns. The response to me voicing my concerns, didn't not indicate that anyone had read my previous correspondences. Overall, I wish I could've updated my address sooner, so I'll take that, but their handling of this and communication was disappointing."

We thought that would be common sense. Before signing up for Billo, I even reached out to their customer support and asked if they had creators with pets for pet supplies and I was assured there would indeed be creators with pets. One video we requested edits to eventually gave us a pet, but it wasn't the right pet (we wanted a guinea pig or hamster and we got a rabbit). One woman applied to our \"task\" of making a video about our mini dog tennis balls and she didn't even have a dog! For the last task we created, I specifically said do not mention anything, just show your dogs playing with this product, and then come to find out later when reviewing the video (which had mentions) the people working for Billo kept telling the creator to add sound, even though we didn't want any. I do not feel the people running Billo are competent enough to give their customers what they want for businesses in the pet supply industry. We won't be using them again."

In another video, she is selling the product, when asked to sound natural. Another video, woman looks like she is PMSing and she is about to murder someone. In another video they do not speak in the camera. Another video, it's a skincare product, they do not even bother to apply the product...  and this list goes on and on.... This is ridiculous.

If you're working consistently, it's easy to make $1000+ from it a month.However, I have issues with the timer system as you have 5 days to make the video and get it back to the brand. That timer does not pause if you're waiting on a response from the brand or from Billo support (who has taken 4+ days to get back to me at high volume times). Or during the holidays, which I do think is unfair because most people aren't working then, so I think there should be some sort of holiday pause.I also think that some brands ask WAY too much for what they're paying for. They pay $25 for a video expecting to get the quality of something that people pay hundreds and thousands of dollars for. As a creator, it's very frustrating. Otherwise the app is very straightforward, Billo support is very friendly and supportive, and there's such a wide array of products!"

I have gotten feedback on videos feeling \u201cscripted\u201d, when all I received for directions was direct quotes and product information, and no mention of making it sound candid or personal. If the descriptions and content direction was clearer, that could save time that is spent on re-filming and re-editing. I also know this is true due to offers that note that they want humor or personal experiences noted are created and approved quickly, because they were clear from the beginning.

I did three edits on their video, and in the end they decided to request a refund. It\u2019s a waste of time to work with a brand that is not working well with the creator. There\u2019s nothing on the app that controls the brands in the number of edits they request."

You definitely have to sift through A LOT of terrible influencers that apply to your openings, but I was able to find 2. Most of the influencers don't do anything spectacular in making your videos, so don't expect them to make you videos that go viral or anything, but for the price compared to what it would cost us to film and edit these on our own, it's a great bang for your buck! I do like how fast Billo moves the process along. A lot of influencers take their sweet time once shipped product, but Billo ensures that they have their videos created in days which is great!"

This annoys me, would rather only get helpful notifications and relevant/truthful reminders.Aside from that i think alot of more people have joined the app so i dont get accepted to nearly as many jobs as when i first started.

I really have tried other apps and they aren\u2019t like Billo.app. I wasn\u2019t paid to write this review. I just believe that they are doing a great job. They customer service is amazing 95% of the time. When the task you submit is reviewed they email you with things they would like you to change and there have been a couple instances where the tone of the email seemed harsh. I have this theory that you get approved for more tasks the longer you stay with them. Right now, I have 5 tasks I have to complete and 2 being reviewed that in total is over $100 plus they pay biweekly. I\u2019ve an an amazing experience overall. No big complaints over here. Try it out for yourself!\ud83d\ude0a"

When reaching out for customer service they were able to help and refund my money from the 3rd task. So I am able to hire another one. What I just find inconvinient is that there is no way that I can reach or message the creator. If you have any issue or something I have ti always go thru a third person from the company...which causing alot of delay due to communication barrier. I wish there is a in-app messaging that the your company and the creator can use to communicate. If they are afraid of anything for not giving the creatoes details.. they could atleast set some sort of guidelines. Over all, I will use the app to get creators for my brand due to convinience...esp for me who still have a part-time job and dont have time to create videos."
