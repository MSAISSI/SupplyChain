So all of your business owners that are looking for additional credit lines this will not work for you. As a result, I order $2000 in equipment going to a billing address which route refused delivery, and the procedure to change. The address in route was very complicated as if no one seems to know what to do. Ultimately the product was sent back to the sender  And canceled. It\u2019s really nice when people actually know what\u2019s going on, I would not count on this group to really know what\u2019s going on especially when you get different responses from different people at different points in the transaction not a group I will use again."

Everything seemed like it was gonna work out until about 6 hours later when checked my email and seen that I received an email stating my package has been shipped. So I have no idea what's going on with either of these 2 companies or they both decided to screw me but I have no intention of paying this debt. Stay clear away."

It's like tax evasion, dodging transparency to rip financially illiterate people off.I'm filing a complaint with the Illinois Attorney General's Office with my friend against both PayTomorrow and the dealer from which he made this agreement. This is completely insane, and honestly, I can't see how this isn't illegal. It just may be."

          "Contenu": "Hi I got a loan for a pool from family pool fun this company, Pay Tommorow/BMI.  I have made all my payments on time.  Last month the rep pulled my payment 12-31-19.  This month the money was in the act and I just talked to them yesterday 1-30-20.  I even said that I understand my payment is in process of being pulled.  Rep Taylor replied yes it is.  So today 1-31-20 I get 2 nasty messages that I've been late with several payments.  Your act is in distress status.  I will be getting late charges & bouncing fees.  So I called back and insisted he pull payment and it insisted that he pull it immediately.  Payment went thru no issues.  Taylor never apologized or said I am sorry for his phone messages or rudeness.  This is how they treat people not professional in any way.  I'm highly dissatisfied and disappointed with Pay Tommorrow, BMI, and family pool fun.  PayTommorow could of politely called or asked while I was on the phone with them yesterday. As weve been battling them since the winter pool cover was supposed the armour cover and we got just a thin tarp which is shredded from the Pa winter storms.  In addition to the upgraded pool has gotten a tear which it's been months of communicating thru Jay and the warranty which still neither has been replaced, we have a lot of run around.  A lot of disappointment. We followed directions in building said.  Also sent emails and pictures of problems.Thanks S Eckman Review stays the same your customer service is horrible and useless.  Will pay this loan off.  No real comment from company except for blaming the other part of the company.  We have heard it before."

          "Contenu": "Constructive is a matter of perspective- first of all \ud83e\udd23Secondly- \"interest free\" if paid in 90 days, but you still have interest on it....pretty sure that's not \"interest free\" but OKAYAlso the way you phrased things in the setup is misleading in the way some stores price one item for like $5.00, then like the 2pk is like $10.99 (but they like hide it way better because they advertise it in a way that makes you THINK you're getting a better deal).Your contracts arent very clear in the what you would pay, what you are paying, how long, etc. I literally talked to one of your reps that said she finds people often are confused when reading your contracts. Soooo clearly either that's one of your ways to get money out of people easier, or something.Also one of your reps was kinda short. Told me basically \"per my last email\" when her last email didn't have anything to do with my question. I had to remind her \"didn't you say if I don't have my order by my first payment due date, you'd push it out?\" Then she wasn't short with me. She was short in email and over the phone. Last one or two I spoke to were nice though.I just remember Sadie was not so much (remembered her name only because that's my nickname).Next issue I had was that PayTomorrow and the company I bought from DO NOT COMMUNICATE whatsoever. And PayTomorrow doesnt tell you your full outstanding balance online. You have to call each time you need that info.Also cannot pay more than you actually owe at that time without calling.When my order was not only late, but they shipped without customizations I ordered- and reached out after the fact saying they did so- they refused to send the check to PayTomorrow.But they sent me my contract that I have with PayTomorrow before PayTomorrow did \ud83e\udd23Sadie also told me in my initial call that I would be contacted by one of their reps....that NEVER happened....she thought it was weird they didn't....well I mean the company that you paid wouldn't even send my $500 reimbursement to you for the customizations they failed to honor. So like, clearly this whole this was just simply a terrible experience. Should've just waited a bit longer to pay in full out of pocket, MAJOR regrets even though it's all paid off in the 90 day period. Do not recommend"

I purchased wheels and an exhaust system for $3600. I  Read about \u201cpay tomorrow\u201d thought the payments were definitely manageable. Due to the low monthly payments. I purchased my products Jan 23rd\u2026after looking at the contracts, (VERY confusing) I added up what the final payments were and that $3600 is over $5000 in 2 years. I decided to pay it off. Now consider that I purchased the equipment Jan 23, I paid it off Feb 4. In 12 days they charged me over $200 to pay it off. That comes out to about 30% interest! A high interest credit card at 27% interest rate would have been better to use. I get that people are strapped for cash, but try to look into other option prior to accepting the pay tomorrow contract. I only lost $200 and I make a decent living! But the alternative in paying that high interest is alarming to say the least!"

Seemed to take a longtime to get someone on the phone. The last couple times were not bad, but the first few times were. So maybe they improved that. 2. I called in August, maybe September last year to see about fully paying off my loan. The lady i spoke with said that it would not save me any money by paying early...and that they report to the credit bureau and by paying monthly, it will help my credit. So I opted not to pay it off early. Then, this month, I got an email when they pulled the monthly payment out  saying that I would save roughly $50 by paying it off early. I was pretty upset that this was the case. I could have paid it off earlier and saved quite a bit more money. Maybe it is a training issue, or a way to get more money out of me, I dont know. But it will make me second guess financing with pay tomorrow if there is a next time."

I needed to replace an order which complicated the process a bit, so it might be good to offer flexibility with order adjustments, but that was more a problem with me and the vendor.

I don't understand why a picture cannot be taken and printed and put in box to speed that process up. Other than this, I think you deserve a 5 Star review. However this is important to me because you are one of only 2 sites I cannot put a photo onto your site. Your service is great. Your representatives are friendly and helpful and the products I purchased were of good quality. Well the tires were and I have them on my car and they work just fine. However the 4 smaller items I am sending back for the reasons you are aware of, can't be sent until I upload a photo of them to the return page link you sent me. I cannot accomplish that. I can put that photo on other sites but not yours. WHY?        Just asking and am working on that currently still!Thank You, for your service and I will reccomend that anyone in need, apply to you for their needs which you cover. Homer WardCc:  on file"
