I do appreciate that there have been some recognizable updates to the program since we began using it, but there is still some blatant room for improvement.  There have been a few significant outages since which have caused some serious stress and panic for us and for our clients.  To compound the problem, Textline Support's primary contact method is Textline itself, so when an issue or outage occurs, we can barely report the problem (at least in a timely manner).  The other issue with support is that they only keep standard office hours in the Pacific Time Zone, while the beauty of texting is that it can happen at any time.  Being in the Central Time Zone, sometimes a problem doesn't even start to get addressed until hours after our workday has already begun.  I do really appreciate that it seems as though the developers are working to continuously improve the program and expand its available functions. Having the ability to \"whisper\" or have internal conversations directly on a conversation thread, and having the mobile app are non-negotiables for us.  Although there is room for improvement, we are definitely willing to stick around because we believe the improvements will actually come to fruition at some point."
