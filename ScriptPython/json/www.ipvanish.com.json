Then Bobby asked me to send details of the invoice I paid last year through PayPal. I did this only to be notified that they had charged $149.44 to my PayPal account - almost 5 times more that I had been quoted. I have sent 3 emails since to get a refund but all of these have been ignored. I now have no option but to open a dispute on my PayPal account."

I will use another VPN provider and at the same time, save some money.  Or do u want to offer me a year for free?"

Money is tight now, so I wanted to drop it for a while. But after this, I won't be back this time. I don't understand these 30 day rules.

They also state on their site they have 24/7 support but when I tried contacting them tonight at 12:30 AM est, the bot told me there was nobody online to help me.  So much for their nonexistent support.  I have over 2.5 months left on my contract but I guess I'm SOOL to get help. Glad I arranged contract termination at the end of this subscriptionAdded: Wes emailed me at 6:24pm tonight(Jan 23 2023) asking for my PayPal invoice ID as proof of account ownership and when I noticed the message at 9:21pm, I replied and provided the ID. Since then, they've made no further contact.  I need the issue resolved and don't want to keep waiting. I first addressed the issue with them last weekADDED JAN 30 2023: after i emailed them AGAIN, they called me today but told me they no longer offer the ability to cast from device to tv. I still have  over 2 months left on my subscription and noticed this issue about 2 months ago and  can't use the vpn to prevent my isp from monitoring me then buffering my connection. This vpn is useless. They also DIDN'T offer any refund. BUYER BEWARE. Your service and money will vanish, though"

          "Contenu": "DO NOT USE IP VANISH. This company has continued to try to take money from my bank 5 times in the past month without authorisation. On 20th Aug i received an email to say my subscription was due to be renewed on 25th Sep 2022 as IPVanish set up auto renewal. The email stated If you wish to change your service, log in to your Account Portal and select the \u2018Subscription\u2019 tab. To which i exercised my right for my subscription to not be renewed and end on the this date. I was then contacted by Jelynn from the IPVanish Support Team stating \" We are reaching out because you mean a lot to us. We can see that you are looking for a less expensive option. I am delighted to be able to offer you the next year of IPVanish for only $28.80  ( a 68% saving off of our $89.99 standard VPN Subscription) I then received 3 additional emails all the same \"Hello,I wanted to follow up with you regarding our last message. Let us know if you're interested in proceeding and a member of our team can help you immediately. Jelynn I never replied as I had already made my decision and had changed my preferences so that my subscription would end as above.On the 26th November I then received an email telling me my payment method could not be charged. Why have these people tried to charge me?More emails followed stating my account will be suspended. I have contacted them numerous times advising that I do not want to continue any subscription with them and to stop trying to take money from my account without authorisation and all I get is the same response. For me to cancel I must provide them with my card details, full name and post code"

          "Contenu": "I got IPVanish at a recommendation of someone I was doing business with because I was having trouble with my firestick reception and it turned out I didn't need the service. I realized this a day or two into getting the service so I made sure I canceled within the 30 day free trial period window. I no longer had the service and this company still charged my Paypal account and I had no idea until this year when they charged it again 84.99!  They were trying to delay giving me that back but I got my bank to refund it right away and after almost 3 months of going back and forth with Wes from IPVanish I still have not received my refund that they were never supposed to take in the first place because I canceled my service within the first two days during the \"free trial period\". Do not use their service because if you have any issues their customer service is HORRIBLE it seems like Wes is the only employee at the company because he claims I can't talk to anyone else their is  no one on a higher level that I can talk to. At this point I am not even sure I will get my money back I feel like every time I talk to him (only via text btw because there's no number to call to speak to anyone) he always has an excuse as to why its taking so long to receive my money that they never should've taken in the first place and tried to take again...smh!"

          "Contenu": "If you live in the UK this VPN in my opinion is rubbish!! It is detected by just about every important website and thus you cannot connect unless you disconnect the VPN which defeats the whole point of having a VPN!! The following of my applications will not work with this VPN: BBC I Player, Amazon Fire Stick, BBC F1 audio, Google, National Lottery, BT, Barclays, Natwest, ITV Player and dozens of Retail Sites that will not accept payment with this VPN switched on. I assume dozens of others in the UK that I do not use but you may do, will not work when using this VPN. I have contacted IPVanish and confirmed with them they do NOT have a solution but of couse they do not want me to tell you that so no doubt they will come up with a load of rubbish in reply to this review However, you can trust me because I know what I am talking about and I am lumbered with this VPN until February and I have exhausted all the options. Originally, one idea I really liked was that I could install IPVanish via Merlin software directly on my router which gave me the VPN at source so I did not have to connect each device seperately or install the program on every device. When I did this it looked very promising until I found that it simply blocked at source (The Router)  all the websites mentioned earlier and probably many more and of course in order to fix this I would then have to log into my router to switch the whole program  off in order to get the relevant web sites so nothing worked for me here in the UK. be warned!!!"

It was suggested that the online help I received via their chat didn't have all the information required even though I was given the impression it was resolved and wouldn't renew.They are now asking for an additional payment for the new years subscription which will then activate an automatic payment back to me. Why they cannot provide a refund I don't know.

It's not in their financial bottom line interest. So I removed the payment information which was the only solution. Sure enough I got a notification to update my payment info.

Our hope is to make IPVanish work with as many websites as possible, but it is more important for us to remain transparent with you about this restriction. The BBC has taken measures to block all VPN connections from IPVanish. Though we have implored the network not to target those protecting their online privacy with our service, these pleas have fallen upon deaf ears. While our team works hard accommodating service access for streaming video, we wish to gently remind you that IPVanish is primarily a privacy product and should be used as such. We apologize for any inconvenience. \u201dWhether this is the final \u2018fob-off\u2019 line simply to close down my ticket, or the reality of the situation, I don\u2019t know, but others might like to draw their own conclusions."

The service worked great. I had no buffer or anything in my videos. I decided that i wanted the yearly subscription. But i also wanted the discount code offered by one of my favorite youtube channel. So i cancelled my subscription. Do not cancel your subscription if you have ipvanish they'll never forget. So after i got my refund i went back to try to get the yearly deal....nope, it says that my ip has been blocked from downloading the service again. So then i went to the email they sent me about cancelling my subscription and saw if i could just reactivate my old account and try to switch to the yearly plan through the account.....nope! It doesn't work. I can't sign up again.Now i don't know if this is ipvanish doing this but..i try to subscribe to other vpn services. 2 others. There is always a crash when i try to pay for it. I don't know if this is ipvanish putting a real block on my ip but they've completely lost my favor. Avoid this company y'all. Not for service but for reputation."

I was surprised to learn that I could no longer sign in with my existing password, as it contains the special character '#'. I was also informed that the character '!' cannot be used.Customers should be made aware of this condition. It would have saved me hours of frustration.Additionally, once signed in, I was unable to connect to my optimum server. I used live chat & was advised to change the protocol from 'wireguard' to 'open VPN'.Following this advice, my device is now successfully connected.Strangely enough, all my other devices are using a password with the # character & are connected via the wireguard protocol.I'm happy with IP Vanish, but the company really needs to share this information with customers, to avoid wasting time & effort."

At this point, I decided to request a refund, only to discover that the refund policy required purchasing the yearly plan, which I found quite frustrating.I continued to inquire about the possibility of a refund, knowing it might not be possible but still feeling frustrated with the situation.Since I couldn't refund, I just decided to use the Windows app on my device, and it works good without the need for manual configurations."

I told them if you want to keep customers renewals  you need to offer the discount before they cancel and then the emails started that they were trying to recharge my credit card for a renewal subscription.They actually tried to charge my card 3 times but failed. Keep demanding I give them my information so they could decide if I was the customer.   So if your a customer I can tell you if you want a better price demand one or leave.

(support.ipvanish - DOT - com/hc/en-us/articles/115002074834-Auto-renew).FYI - I changed my 1 Star rating to a 3 Star. Overall I'm pleased with the way IPVanish handle the issue, I just would have liked to have received an email regarding the pending renewal so I could have stopped the renewal before it occurred. Had I received that email they would have earned 5 Stars, as I was pleased with the service up until the renewal.ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW:Woke up yesterday to a charge that I did not authorize. Apparently when signing up they enroll you in auto renewal. They do this without letting you know. Also, they do not send out a heads up email like other companies to let you know that the auto renewal is about to happen."

Nice to have a Task Kill that immediatly isolates your dispositive from the net, but it's a big pest to wait to the reconnection every time, may while you are doing something of importance.A serious risk to privacy is due to the fact that IPVanish doesn't start immediately when the computer is switched on, but does in time to connect unprotected wi-fi, with all applications, before you start the VPN. I'm sure that isn't set up any delay for this program. I don't know why so that is always start last.Very nice graphic interface and some tools are useful, like the LAN Task Kill and prevention of IPV6 leaks or DNS leaks. The \"Scramble\" function, instead, does not prevent at all from being recognized as VPN users.Overall, it can be improved a lot, but the bases are good. Nothing to do, though with the real industrial VPNs."

If you are skeptical about trying their product and opt for a 1-month money-back trial, they capitalize on you and deny you a refund. The fine print states the money back is only for the annual plan. This is predatory because more skeptical people wanting a refund will wish to try 1 month first."

I'm in the US and I streamed in UK and Australia so far and it worked great. I didn't try it in other countries but I'm sure it would work there too. The only reason I didn't give it 5 Stars is because the speeds are not what I'm looking for. the mpbs without it reads about 324 upload and 41 download. When I put it on, it drops drastically to 81mpbs upload and 37 download. That's a massive drop. Other than that, I am delighted with the product and would of stayed if it weren't for the drop in speeds. I'll be leaving another review once I cancel. So far the customer service has been superb as well. I have no complaints other than the speed. Two Thumbs Up for me on most of the service.."

Had not received a notice from IPVanish that act was near renewal. Checked act and it was set to expire on 12/2. Wasn't any time, so I assumed it was for a year, so I explained to tech support that that seemed to be an exorbitant amt. since I was all the time seeing how they discounted subscriptions to new users.  And how I had been a customer for years and there were other VPN companies who would treat me as a \"new user\". Ginno was very professional and patient. He was able to offer me a great deal on my renewal subscription and have the amt I was charged returned to my paypal act. Great people and easy to deal with . Five stars as far as I am concerned"

Their customer service was absolutely excellent in helping me with my issue. They were able to renew my subscription for about the same price I paid last year.

Once I was up and running, the speed and reliability of the VPN were exceptional. I was able to browse the web, stream videos, and download files without any lag or buffering issues.What really stood out to me was the company's commitment to privacy and security. IPVanish utilizes top-of-the-line encryption and has a strict no-logging policy, so I feel confident that my online activity is secure and private.In addition, the customer support team was extremely helpful when I had a question about setting up the VPN on my device. They were quick to respond and provided clear instructions that made the process easy.Overall, I highly recommend IPVanish to anyone looking for a reliable and secure VPN. The company's commitment to privacy and customer service sets them apart from the competition. 5 stars!"

They provided me a VPN version to accommodate my Operating System (OS) even though they are using upgraded versions for current Operating Systems.  They always modify my annual cost to a lower amount.  But I do have to contact Customer Service around renewal time to negotiate a change in price.  If anything, I would like to suggest to your business, for the subscribers that have a long standing order with your services, when a person is coming up for annual renewal, IP Vanish should reward and advertise exclusively to those customers, beforehand, a reduced renewal rate to inspire repeat/recurring service.  Instead of having the customer contact and haggle a reduced rate.  There are so many VPN services always advertising great deals to steal business away from you.  Customers like to have attention.  It makes us feel wanted, even though we already know this.  Validation if you will.  When a customer is handed a reduced renewal service plan prior expiration, it makes the process and decision easy.  Easy is good.  Reward loyalty and excite your customers. Thank you. Dale"
