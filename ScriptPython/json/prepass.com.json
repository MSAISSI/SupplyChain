The charges come all different times, not one set time like one bill for the another bill for next month. Instead  I'm receiving one to two bills. Different times of the month after I think that I paid the bill. Another one comes None of this makes any sense."

Turned it back on, got charged more late fees because the bill wasn't paid. I canceled their services over 7 months ago and still getting emails about owing them money, every time i get one the price goes up, I think its up to over 180 dollars now. Customer service refuses to talk to me, they won't give an intelligent answer or be helpful on the phone, emails are useless. Prepass exercises very shady operating standards but what can you expect from companies that extort truck drivers."

My company hasn't left our home state in more than 2 years and the vehicle associated with the transponder isn't my plate.

The competitor system advice about a Station in 2 miles at first time and give me a Station decision about bypass on time. One more star I took off because of PrePass try to get unexpected charges. I used it during about one and half month. Advertising said about first month free but I was charge about $28. The company try to charge me for a transponder return cost too."

The lady was trying to tell me to enter in as a lost/stolen device and I was like why would I do that and then the notice said clicking that would incur a 100.00 charge on the next invoice. I told her why would I choose that option if was not either of those and she said fine go ahead and choose the damaged/defaced option but that too would incur a charge. She was starting to talk very loud trying to talk over me and was saying ma\u2019am you aren\u2019t going to be charged. I was like how you going to tell me I\u2019m not going to get charged if your system is telling me such. She said hold on and put me on hold. 5 min later she came back on and said ok you are going to click on the return to inventory button. But not once did that woman apologize for giving me the wrong info. Her name was Myra and she had no clue what she was doing. All in all she was going to send the address to have the device sent back to them but she never once said here is the info you need to send back the device, I had to ask her before she hung up.RUDE!"

If you have ANY issues with your ACH  credit card on file they immediately threaten you with cancellation.  We Received their invoice on the 2nd stating the payment was due on the 21st.  4 days later received another email stating account closure because the credit card on file had expired, not, a friendly reminder that the information needed to be updated, just we are cancelling your account. The information was updated immediately upon receiving this email and payment was made via their automated phone system. THEN 2 hours later receive a phone call stating our account had been cancelled!!!!! (The payment had already cleared our bank account). We are told that you can not update the ACH information on the automated system (even though it asks you!!). AND The payment is due on the 1st, not the 21st as THEIR statement shows. They have no explanation for the due date being the 21st on their WRITTEN Invoice other than per their \u201cverbal disclosure\u201d it is due the 1st.  This company need to get its act together and get ALL of their systems to coincide!!!!  I will take a written statement over a verbal any day. WTH?!?  And if you have a customer that has paid via ACH for 2 years and then have an issue with the payment method a polite reminder would get a lot better response than just saying the account is cancelled, especially when it had  \u201csupposedly\u201d been handled via YOUR phone in system!!  Oversights happen, give your customers the benefit of the doubt!!!!!"

For contacting us back I will add 1 starTheir billing practices are their downfall!! We get charged at the end of the month even though billing is for the first the day after they debit our bank account we get the email stating what they drafted. The day after we get the amount emailed to us we finally get an invoice for the charges. This is 100% backwards and they chose to stop invoicing prior to the draft of funds. Per their contract we can't stop auto payments therefore can't stop them from doing this! We like the service it helps our drivers but they need to fix the billing practices"

I have finally removed the little box inside the bigger box and placed both side by side on the bottom behind of my windshield/ top of my dashboard and the EZ Pass will read better, but at times it may glitch. I had a similar issue with the EZ Pass only unit I started with working in most states except Del. and NJ. I feel like the Big box design needs to be revamped for a more universal mounting option. Possibly an exterior mirror bracket mounted design option available. Thank you for your products that help us be more productive."

          "Contenu": "Love having the prepass setup in the truck, especially since this pandemic is everywhere.  I'm not happy that the tolls are going up again come Jan 2021,  as we use the toll system every week when we travel in the states. Us large cars (Trucks with 5 axles or more, should be paying less.  We've been out here doing our deliveries during this pandemic and no consideration for us.  We don't get breaks anywhere. Instead we end up paying the lions share of things.  Now, I'm just the one truck now, and it is expensive, and we have no choice but to pay.  Getting to O'Hare airport on Patton drive,  you have no choice but to use the toll system...may of our deliveries and the time needed,  we use the tolls to save time ( no lights etc)  Maybe  a different charge fee, like single truck in a company...  fees like a car?  2-4 you pay more.  Any company with 10 or more trucks,  obviously have the money to pay the tolls, and they could stay at the price now.  Us smaller companies,  should get a break.  This is just an observation.  I have noticed, this year, that the construction is being done quicklier.  Good job.  That's all I wanted to get off of my chest."
