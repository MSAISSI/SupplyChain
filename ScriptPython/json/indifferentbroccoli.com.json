In addition, support has been very fast any time I have needed it and my server's uptime has been literally 100% aside from when I have taken it down to do something.  The value IB offers for the prices they charge is unmatched anywhere else I have tried.  I have used at least three others hosts prior to IB and if the services continue as they are today, I'll never go anywhere else for my PZ hosting needs.Special shoutout to VeRgZ, who has spoken with me directly each time I have needed support, and has typically been able to respond to me within minutes of my question/ticket."

          "Contenu": "I was dubious about using a company I hadn't heard of before to host a new Valheim server. MY fears were completely unfounded. I started with the free trial and even though I forgot to add payment details once it had expired they still saved my world and gave me time to decide if I wanted to continue with the paid version. They didnt just delete it right away. I have been using them for 2 months now without a fault and yesterday there was a slight issue with the server. My card had some attempted fraud on it so they couldnt take the initial payment and so the subscription was paused. Once they took the payment The server didnt restart immediately. I posted a message on their discord asking why I couldnt access my server config on their website and within seconds they were on top of it. les than 5 minutes later my issues (which wasn't even their fault) was resolved and they even helped update my server with the new H&H patch.Their site is easy to use and the customer service team are fantastic - dont hesitate to give them a try!!!"

Every night I logged in and we went off to do something together at least once or twice during the night we faced desync issues.I have since swapped to Broccoli and had no issues at all.  I used the guide to migrate my server from the old host to this one and while it was confusing I managed to get both the world and player database working on your servers.I also enjoy that I am paying for slots and not RAM.  I know Zomboid doesn't use a crazy amount of RAM but it is a relief to not have to do any math to figure out how much RAM we might need for the server to function and for someone like me who isn't too keen on server specifics it's peace of mind to not have to worry and just buy the slots.Don't even get me started on the discord bot that comes with the server.  I looked at a guide to make a bot and no thanks.  It's nice to let people reset the server whenever they need even if I'm not aroundThank you for everything!"

I'm also quite happy with the server management options, including the file system utility. There have been a few strange behaviors I've noticed in server automation and management but nothing that didn't resolve and nothing too serious. I also feel that the pricing is very reasonable and the support is proactive, future-oriented and helpful. I kind of didn't appreciate being repeatedly asked to provide this feedback because my experience so far is still quite short-lived and I don't much like being told what to do. Generally though, a very positive experience."

A quick Google search lead me to Indifferent Broccoli. Pleased at the idea of 2 day trial without needing to enter credit card info,  I signed up. Within 3 minutes I got notification the server was up and running. Using the website, I adjusted some settings and restarted the server. Then set out to give the game a test run. I was happy to see the provided link launched the game for me and connected automatically.  Just had to put in the selected password. The game loaded up just as quick as if I was playing solo on my own computer. Ran around for a few minutes and experienced no lag. Next I tested the option to wipe the server. Worked quicker than it estimated.Everything was set for a 2 hour gaming session with a friend who had never played 7D2D before. Got them the link and everything went smoothly. Good time was had and the next day we agreed to continue and to pay the monthly fee. During the process, I received a couple emails asking how I was doing and offering any assistance. They were not forceful or pushy. Very pleasant and polite. Overall, a great experience, would definitely recommend."

Get booted in one spot only to log back in yards back surrounded by zombies!  That is what my players where willing to put up with so they wouldn't have to start over one more time, to lose any of their progress... All because I an not a good admin and I have not the skills to transfer our game data to another server.  I.B. and their HUMAN support staff took my information directly and transferred all our game data: players, progress, map and mods.  My players where back in the game within TWO HOURS!  All without ever asking for my credit card number.I.B. took care of the computer nerd stuff so I could get back to the gaming nerd stuff!  My players are happy and slaughtering zombies with delight and I still haven't even filled out any billing information! (I'll go do that now!)"
