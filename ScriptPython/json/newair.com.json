The initial warranty had expired and they only offered a discount on a new unit. So buyer beware. This company does not stand by their products. I understand the warranty is out and that possible repairs may be needed. However, for the entire unit to need to be replaced in less than two years tells me this company does not make long-lasting products and does not stand behind the products they sell. DO NOT PURCHASE NEWAIR."

They took 3 days to answer and then wanted $19.95 for the hose. The AC only cost $150.00. So I asked for a quote with shipping to Montana. That added another $20.00! The total would be about 1/3 of what the entire AC cost. I declined. Then they sent me a request to review their employee who gave me the quote. Seriously? They wanted me to evaluate their employee! So I was honest and submitted a review. I said the employee was fine but the company sucked. I told them that if I was their employee I would quit and find a company that trusted my abilities and did not ask customers to do the boss's job. So next I get an obviously automated response profusely thanking me for my employee review and requesting that I place a review on FaceBook, Google, or Trust Pilot. Facebook and Google have their own trust issues. They spy on users and sell private user data to the highest bidder. Why should anyone trust them? So I chose Trust Pilot and left an honest review. New Air sucks and I will never buy any of their products."

I called in early November and was given cleaning tips which I had been already doing but tried again.  Three days later brown substance was back.  So I called back again and as asked for pictures of the substance and a copy of the receipt, both of which I provided.  This morning I was told that a replacement was not covered in the warranty and that if I gave a positive review she would waive the shipping charge.  I didn\u2019t pay a shipping charge when I ordered the first one on Amazon Prime so this was not much of an incentive.  As it stands now, I have to clean the machine 3 times each week to try to make sure that whatever the brown substance is, that it won\u2019t poison my family.  This is awful customer service in my opinion.  All I wanted was a replacement on a machine that literally costs Newair a fraction of what I paid for it!  Why on earth would I buy another one that may do the exact same thing? That\u2019s ridiculous!"

          "Contenu": "Do your own due diligence and do not solely trust Newair reviews on Google and Trustpilot as they are, in my opinion, not a reflection of the actual products offered by company or the after sale service. The only reflection here is that majority of these consumers had an issue with their product and they were promised/given a replacement. Hence that\u2019s why you see so many shout outs to the customer service agents who advised them to leave the reviews. In my experience, the name of the game was bait & switch.I purchased a Newair 840 cigar humidor remanufactured by Newair in July 2022. Unit arrived two months later, physically and functionally damaged. I was promised a replacement in lieu of posting reviews on Google and Trustpilot which I did. The very next day, I was informed the unit was out of stock. Even though I was disappointed, I figured I could wait a little longer for a replacement as I really liked the unit.Fast forward to August 2023, skipping out some \u201care we there yet\u201d communications, I asked for a replacement to be processed and also asked how I could communicate with the senior leadership of the company regarding my disappointing experience. I was never offered a way to communicate with anyone in senior leadership but I was offered a replacement once again! This time instead of reviews, I just needed to cut the power cord to the unit to prepare to discard and take some picture to send back to Newair while I wait for my replacement unit. To my not so surprise, I was informed the next day the unit could not be replaced because it was remanufactured like they didn\u2019t know all along. I was never offered a way to communicate with someone else and received an email stating a refund was processed after filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.I\u2019m especially disappointed that Newair could not stand behind their word, twice. If you promise something, it\u2019s your responsibility to follow thorough. If it\u2019s your incompetent customer service\u2019s mistake, then you own up to that and honor what they promise as the representatives of your brand name!I loved the unique look and functions of the Newair 840. The company has some innovative and fun products that are out of norm in small appliances. I could have purchased their 1500 humidor model or a nice beverage cooler in the future but there are brands who I know will stand behind their products with confidence. Newair\u2019s incompetent customer service is enough for me to look elsewhere in the future."

          "Contenu": "Atrocious customer service a day agoI purchased a new air beverage refrigerator two years ago. The blue colored lightbulbs burnt out so Icontacted New Air to purchase new lightbulbs for the beverage refrigerator.  One of the specific reasons I purchased this particular beverage refrigerator was because it illuminated a blue color and looked really cool. For two months I have reached out six different times via emails(5) and phone calls (6) regarding this beverage refrigerator with model number, SKU number, and photographs to get new light bulbs.  Two separate times I received the incorrect lightbulbs. Each time I was told they would follow up and call me back regarding the correct lightbulb request and never received a follow up whatsoever. I\u2019m going on two months now dealing with this and have decided that I will never get anywhere with this company. All I wanted were simple lightbulbs and I can\u2019t recieve adequate customer service.  I can imagine if I had a serious issue with the beverage refrigerator. They can\u2019t even handle a simple request .Profile imageKim ShumateUpdate\u2026 I received a reply from New Air last night, requesting that I call them today and they will take care of the issue. I phoned them twice today and not surprisingly DID NOT receive a phone call back from customer service. I guess I was hoping that they would rectify my tiny request for lightbulbs for my beverage refrigerator. How disappointing. I give up I have never had such horrendous customer service ever for anything.Update regarding customer service. After receiving a letter from New Air, they proceeded to send me the same incorrect lightbulbs for the third time. They seem to have a difficult time finding the correct lightbulbs, even though I sent them photos of the correct lightbulbs that I need but receiving the incorrect lightbulbs three times. I am now sitting with six incorrect lightbulbs for my new air fridge and they can\u2019t seem to get my simple request correct. At this point it is comical, I will keep you updated because now I\u2019m curious to see if they\u2019ll ever get it right.  The definition of stupid is doing the same thing over and over without changing. Let\u2019s see what happens. I sent them a photo of the lightbulb that I need and I don\u2019t understand why it is so hard to fulfill that request. Follow up, I made two phone calls today to the customer service that they asked me to call. I thought they would rectify the problem but they never returned both of my phone calls. I guess I\u2019m not that disappointed since the original customer service was horrible.  Beware of any issues you may have with their products.  All I wanted was two little lightbulbs for the beverage refrigerator, it wasn\u2019t even a serious issue with the product itself. What does that tell you. Beware.UpdateOne month later\u2026\u2026 still waiting for A Follow up\u2026\u2026 NOTHING \ud83d\ude2cANOTHER ATROCIOUS UPDATE\u2026I received a 3rd attempted lightbulb replacement request\u2026 THIS IS MY 3rd incorrect order delivered\u2026.this is now comical."

I requested a new unit or a certified technician to repair it. What I got was an offer of 40% off a new unit!. The company knows that this unit has a faulty fuse issue and sells it anyway. They refuse to do anything else because I did not buy an extended warranty!!!"

The unit would not stay running to get to the temperature we set. I called their support line and since they could not help they shipped out a new unit. We set that unit up and it did the same as the first one. I called support again and told them I'd be shipping both back and would like a refund for the first one we purchased.Since it was purchased through Amazon, Newair has to cut a check back to me. I was told it could take up to 30 days. They received the units back on July 18th, 2022. It's been almost 10 weeks (80 days) and no refund. Everytime I contact them I get the same response \"it takes up to 30 days\", when I point out that it's been over 2 months all I get is \"please be patient\". It should not take this long to refund my money.I've since filed a claim with my credit card company. They've credited my money back and are now going after them for it.DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY!!!"

Over the past few months the banging has gotten louder and can be heard in other parts of the house. The humidification is set at 70% humidity, however, the cigars have never felt right. I purchased a hygrometer calibration kit. After placing the calibrated hygrometer in the humidor for 48 hours it read 59% not the 70% it is set at. Since the unit is still under warranty, I contacted Customer Support I was asked to send a recording of the sound which I did. I was told the \"noise is normal & is coming from the expansion valve.\" I was also told I had to \"set 3 hygrometers in the unit to accurately measure the humidity.\" I have owned other NewAir humidors and have never heard of such ridiculous statements. NewAir clearly will say anything to get out of honoring the warranty they say exists."

When that month arrives we are given another date -  so on and so forth.  Needless to say, we have a fairly new appliance that has not worked for 6 months.  The company was so \"kind\" as to offer us a small discount on purchasing a new unit from them.  Why would we buy another one of your products when we already have a fairly new one that doesn't work and apparently will never be repaired?  VERY DISAPPOINTED - we will not be purchasing your products in the future.Original review date 4/27/2022We are having some temperature issues with our Newair wine/beverage cooler.  I reached out via email to their customer support team and much to my surprise they have been very responsive.  In today's environment, good customer service (especially on a previously purchased product) is hard to find.  They have answered questions, and given troubleshooting tips and solutions.

Site said order should ship within 2 days for the item I purchased. After around a week, I still hadn't received tracking info, so I reached out to their customer service team. I spoke with 4 different CSRs over the course of a few days and phone calls, each read the same canned response off their sheet and said that tracking info is commonly delayed in populating and I'd receive info in the next 24 hrs. Nothing. After 3 more days, I finally opted to cancel my order and move on with my life. Refund received, that should have been the end of it. Then 2 weeks after receiving my refund (almost 4 weeks after date of order), my fridge was delivered even though I'd been refunded already. I kept telling myself to just sell it on craigslist, but my conscience won out...decided it wasn't worth bad karma over a fridge I no longer need. So I call customer service over in Asia again, get put on hold for a while, only to frustrate \"Liz,\" a CSR, and get hung up on. Call back again, speak with \"Bev,\" a manager, and she is now attempting to coordinate pickup of this thing. I really doubt this saga is over, this company is so terrible. If it's still in my garage come xmas, I'm donating it to someone in need."

Managers are never available and never called me back.-Finally they determined that they had the correct SKU but that the warehouse somehow keeps shipping the wrong part.  In order for the correct part of be sent, someone at New Air would need to make contact with them and sort this out.-Weeks go by, no update-Never once do they proactively update me.  I always have to follow up.   And I always have to deal with a new person every time I call who is not familiar with the case.  It seems like I am starting from scratch each time-In an act of desperation, I speak with a rep and threaten to email the CEO every day until they fix the issue-Miraculously, the rep makes contact with a manager who indicates that they have finally made contact with the factory and resolved the issue.  New part will be shipped out imminently.-I receive an order confirmation for the new part, but no tracking information.  It says it is going out fedex 2 day air-5 days later, it has not been received-Called and spoke with a rep.  Their system also does not have a tracking #.  She will need to research and will email me an upate.-The saga continues...stay tuned for the final outcome....I'll post my next update in two months when this is still an issue.In the mean time, I can't put my wine fridge against the wall because I broke the drip tray during a defrost because the wine fridge never actually worked right from the start.  Two of the shelves freeze over and the temperature never reaches the desired state.  They said the temperature gauge must be off and sent me a new one to install which requires me to remove every single shelf from the unit.   One of these days I'll get around to that.  In the mean time I am limited to a 50 degree low temp and risk two shelves getting iced to the back every so often.  Will NEVER buy another New Air product so long as I live.  They actually coerced me into writing 3 positive reviews for them by offering free shipping on the part.  So shady."

I was not comfortable sending a copy of my drivers license so I asked her if she can just verify me over the phone. She said she can, but it would be a new order. So I told her that's fine as long as the previous order is canceled and I don't get double charged. She said it is only a hold on the card and if I don't supply my drivers license, the order will get canceled in 48hours. I informed her that I am on my creditcard's website and the charges shows posted and not a hold. she assured me that it was a hold and will be released in 48hours. I checked my account on 4/18 and 2 charges shows up under Newair. I contacted Newair immediately and the customer rep, Fern, told me that both shipment has shipped and they can't refund me until the duplicate shipment gets refused and return to their warehouse. I requested that they contact the shipping company and just cancel the shipment so they can ship it back, but Fern said they contacted the shipping company and they could not do a reroute of the shipment, it had to be refused and sent back. I checked the tracking number for both shipments on 4/21 and both show that it has been at the terminal since 4/15. I called the shipping company to get an update and they said they have been trying to schedule a delivery with me for a week, The BOL had Newair number on it instead of mine and no one at Newair return their call. I explain that I am the consignee and I like to schedule the shipment. I also inquired about the duplicate shipment. The shipping company said according to their notes no one had called contacted them regarding the duplicate shipment and all it takes is a call to them and they would route it back. Because it does not make any sense for them to try and deliver it and have it refused when it is already confirmed to be a cancel shipment. So Newair charged me twice even when they assured me it was a hold, then they lied about the shipping also. Most likely to charge me a restocking fee or some other hidden fees that they are trying to hide. I also never received the free wine tumbler set that was advertised on their website as a free gift with purchase."

          "Contenu": "Purchased NewAir dual zone beverage cooler model AWB-360DB in Feb of 2018 for about $700. In April of 2019 the right side temp sensor failed. Internet research indicates this is a high fail item, has been for quite some time. In fact, such a high failure rate they were out of stock. The part was $21 plus shipping, about $25 total.  With it I lost three bottles of wine so the total cost of the failure and repair was over $100. Today, September 6, 2019, the left side failed but this time I only froze and burst a few soda cans. Part cost was again $21 and in stock this time.  Point is, for a $700 cooler I expect the parts to last longer.  With such a failure rate, why hasn't NewAir engineered something more reliable and offered it to the customers? I feel it is because the temp sensor is proprietary equipment, meaning only they make it and sell it to make money. I looked at my first bad sensor and it did not have any markings, no indication of voltage required or sensor details. NewAir has customers captive, if they want a working cooler they must buy from NewAir, so why improve it and lose out on making money?  At least I can replace it myself  and not pay a technician. If I had a choice I would return this cooler for a refund however the first failure happened just after the one year warranty expired."

After calling them and asking them about the newair cc100h humidor and getting all the info not one time days prior to ordering it did they say it was out of stock. So I ordered a lot of expensive cigars to find out the humidor was out of stock until the end of august I talked to the person in customer service 3 days in a row they told me the same thing it was out of stock until the end of august I knew I was in trouble I had cigars coming and they was delivered by ups that day right around a 100 cigars I spent the day trying to find a safe way to store them needless to say I was upset so another day and a half went by so out of the blue I decided to try to order the newair inspite of what they was telling me. And guess what my order went thru I was shocked and happy at the same time. First thing I did was emailed the person I had been talking to and told them what happened all I got was excuses to I made a mistake to I talk to a lot of people every day and I got the product mixed up, mind you I talked to this person three days in a row and I was told the same thing. So I asked to speak to the manager what good that do he made up more excuses for them telling me that I was upset but I let it go, I was worried about my cigars the humidor came 10 days later because of the weekend I had to season it and get the humidity right for my cigars which was another 9 days by this time my cuban cigars was starting to dry out by the time I got them in the humidor I couldnt save them. So I called the customer service mgr he could care less he offered a 5% discount which was $13 I thought to myself that's crazy to make a long story shorter I ask for Mr Luke Peter's which is the CEO he told me Mr Peter's couldnt take my call right now so the next day I called and asked for Mr Peter's  and the lady said she would have him return my call. But as of today I still havent heard from Mr Peter's he is to good to talk to his customers. Today customer service offered 15% discount for a total of $25 for what they put me thru and what it cost me for the incorrect info that was given to me that cost me almost $300 in cigars that went bad. So you see Newair will no longer be my first choice and I will be returning the unit as soon as they send me a return label put yourself in my shoes do you think $25 is enough for the big costly wrong info given by the customer service rep. You make your own decision if you want to buy from here, but this could have easily been you it happened to and I still havent heard from the CEO Mr Peter's. If any thing change I believe in being fair I will put out another review telling you what changed if any thing because I feel you the customer deserve to know who you are trusting with your next purchase big or small."

I've discussed that you're sure to receive good customer service when shopping under the NewAir umbrella.That being said, the longevity and build quality of their ice makers (in my case the now discontinued Luma Comfort 28) leaves a lot to be desired. I was perfectly happy with mine for about 5 months before the cubes started freezing into one big unbreakable chunk (I believe the problem is a broken sensor that handles the transition from ice creation to dispensing, as I can still do it manually). I was hoping to have it repaired but could not find an appliance shop that would have me and was only offered a replacement by NewAir after trashing mine (for $30 due to its refrigerant) and leaving a few reviews.You would think that posting nearly double the price of a comparibly sized competitors product would ensure a more resilient appliance, but instead you're paying for the year long warranty and speedy, relatively painless customer service as evidenced by the other 300+ NewAir Google reviews regarding their ice makers at the time of writing.I'd hate to create this much waste and hassle for such a minor problem, and maybe that's just the throw away world we live in, but doesn't change that it's abhorrent, especially when you expect a quality product and not just quality service."

If the order doesn\u2019t get to her correctly neither of us will be very happy. There were too many people handling a simple return. It has been like pulling teeth trying to get the right information relayed in the correct format. Everyone was polite but just not very efficient with explaining what information was needed.Update - The new heater has been received. It was in my name not my moms per our many requests. No idea why it was put in my name as I wasn\u2019t the one making the request but I was the one trying to help my mom get this taken care of. The time to fix these issues was when we were asked to send the same info and pictures over and over. Talking to Alai isn\u2019t going to change the lack of consistency in getting the info in one place. We appreciate the being sent quickly but my mom still needs to get the heater off of her wall and get the return label so she can send it back."

It took up very little space on our kitchen counter, and made good clear ice in a surprisingly short amount of time. After about a weeks time it developed a water leak from inside, so I contacted new air to have it replaced. They were very good about this, and easy to return the old faulty machine and receive a new one."

          "Contenu": "We purchased a NewAir nugget ice maker in April and have been very happy with it. The ice is the same shape as Sonic or Chick-Fil-A ice, but it isn't quite as soft and chewy as their ice. We love that the machine is easy to clean and fill with water and that it makes a good amount of ice for our family of 4. One thing we don't like so much is that the ice drawer doesn't stay up when you pull it out (and it is a little hard to pull out, especially for kids). It seems like for an expensive ice machine the drawer would have been designed a little better. We also had an issue with it in July (3 months after purchasing) where a piece of metal inside the machine broke off into the ice bin. But since it is under warranty still, the company is replacing the machine for us."

It worked beautifully the first year, but when I was ready to use it this year, the water pump was not pumping the water onto the pad.  I contacted support and spoke to Charles Trapp. He told me I was in the gray zone where the manufacturer's warranty had only a few days remaining and the additional warranty I purchased had not quite kicked in yet. After we exchanged a few emails, which I was rather late in doing as my husband was in the hospital with a broken hip, he went ahead and shipped me a new water pump along with the instructions for replacing it.I feel like he went above normal support in sending it to me even though I wasn't real fast in responding back to him.  The instructions were easy to follow and I was so happy to have the air conditioner working again.  Thank you Charlie!"
