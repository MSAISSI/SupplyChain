Twigby said they sent Port Out Pin # to my email, however, two days later they repaired their email system and I received a # that did not work. Decided to go with Verizon, and have been waiting for Port Out Pin # that works properly.  Twigby has sent three different #'s now and Verizon says Twigby has to Remove the Delay Status.  Some one has to make this right and have some intelligence.  Obsurd business practices"

In addition, they don't make it clear that autopay is the only payment option. If you sign up, you're signed up for good. You must contact support and go through a bunch of rigamarole to cancel. I threatened to charge back the payment since it wasn't made clear I was signing up for autopay and they threatened in return to charge me $30 for doing the chargeback. It's true that they have my payment information and could try it, but if they do, I will report them to the BBB and FTC. Companies should not be able to threaten their customers with random charges for doing chargebacks. On top of having scummy business practices, like I said, their service stinks. I'm outta here."

And if you cancel their service they can still continue to dip into your payment source and take money.  Try making that stop.  The phone numbers provided are only for bots! They direct you to sign in online,  but you can't if you've canceled their service.  And their chat doesn't work because they don't recognize you as a customer.  BUYER BEWARE! DON'T USE TWIGBY!"

To, again, offer expedited shipping and to NOT ship on Saturdays and Sundays is utterly ridiculous and highly uncompetitive. This EXACTLY why outsourced business are winning in this country. Shameful. I paid for expedited SIM shipping. They not only waited until Monday to ship it, but they never refunded that amount both after delaying SIM shipping and did not refund that amount after I left. 3 stars removed for that. It ended up taking a week for an expedited SIM shipment to be received, and that is entirely unacceptable. I only have to wait 1-3 days with anyone else. They use VZW, which is a very problematic network in most of the country. They cover my area well but their data network is atrocious, so I couldn't stay. Also, when I signed up, it turns out my area code was out of numbers!! I couldn't find this out until I talked to a rep, and while they were able find and figure this out, I do not understand how getting a number is this difficult, and why it did not show any sort of error on my account (in my case, the process was just halted after activating the SIM and I had no idea what I was waiting for). If I did not contact support right away, I would've been waiting for nothing and not have known why."

If you want to be on the Verizon network, Visible is better than Twigby.Twigby had a great deal: $10/month for a 2 GB plan. That promo lasted 6 months, then it turns to $20/mo. I signed up. Within a month, the same priced plan turned into a 3 GB plan, but my plan was still 2 GB. I messaged to see if I could get mine changed. The answer was No, not unless I wanted to give up my $10 promo. I was bummed, but whatever. I still felt like I was getting a good deal.A few months later, I notice Visible has a promo for unlimited data at $15/month (normally $30/mo at that time, but now $25/mo) for 12 months. Twigby is also on the Verizon network. I told Twigby. They said that they couldn't match the deal. I decided to switch to Visible.At this point, I still had a good impression of Twigby. They weren't amazing, but they were cheap. I'll deal with a fair amount of bologna to save money.I tried to cancel my service. They delayed canceling my service until after they charged me for a full month. Legit, we are talking minutes later.I brought it to their attention. They refused to reverse the charge even though I didn't use their service at all that month. I had to file a dispute with my credit card.I couldn't be happier with Visible. I pay $25/month flat (that includes all taxes and stuff). My $20/month plan with Twigby came out to almost $23/month after taxes. For an extra $2 each month, I get unlimited data instead of 2 GB.I haven't tried to cancel with Visible yet. They might pull shady stuff like Twigby, but I doubt it. When I left the country for Japan, I asked them about suspending my service. Visible was like, \"Just don't pay your bill.\" I followed their advice. When I landed in the US, I paid my bill. My service restarted and my new billing date was a month after that. It was really easy.In short, you can be on the same network, spend about the same amount, get more data, and receive much better customer service from Visible. If you want to be on the Verizon network, Visible is the way to go.I hope this review helps. I don't hate Twigby. They just annoyed me."

          "Contenu": "Reliance on USPS is a deal breaker.Refusal to refund on a non-delivered phone because your supplier, the USPS, has not returned it to you yet is NOT MY PROBLEM! [[The response from Twigby is factually correct with two exceptions. 1) I did not agree to send my 84yo mother to the post office to deal with the issue, nor did Twigby offer a telephone number. USPS tracking shows that USPS returned the package. The fact that the supplier hired by twigby, USPS, did not perform as the company expected is not my problem.2) USPS is the primary shipper for Twigby AND it is the only option. Expedited USPS is your only choice if you run into a problem, and that resulted in 6 business days or more delivery time in my case, twice, to a good address. That service is supposed to be 3 to 5 business days. Good luck with that.]]Subsequent delivery of non-functional sim, followed by still undelivered replacement (USPS again) is another example of why relying on USPS will kill your company.Customer service has been given a script that they stick to. Unfailingly polite, but offering no way to escalate other than cancel the contract. That's what we did. [[Both sides of this explanation, mine and Twigby customer service, mostly align. My conclusion is that Twigby's reliance on USPS may introduce delays to your experience, and if there are technical issues, can result in extended delays and possibly outage of your service once you do a number transfer. This made the service unacceptable in my case and I am fully responsible for the mistake in selecting the service. The company offers the service they advertised with the exception of handling of a non-deliverable package by their selected supplier. My conclusion is that this level of service involves risks that I failed to appreciate and that others may find themselves in a similar situation if they choose Twigby. ]]"

That said, it was still a little bit cheaper (at the time) than other services.Porting into the Twigby was fine, but porting out has been a nightmare. It requires a person to port your number out to another carrier, which is fine, but those people don't work weekends. It can also take up to 4 days to get it done, I am told, though it says nothing to that effect anywhere on the site. Customer service just kept repeating that they recommend 4 days, like it was all my fault that this was happening to me. Then I asked if they could at least pro-rate my final month of service since I would only be on for 1 day of the new billing cycle while the porting was taking place and they said no. I was going to be billed for an entire month and there was nothing I could do, even though I started the process 3 days before the end of the cycle. The customer service rep I had was rude and unhelpful. I am glad I am leaving this company. Good riddance. My new plan is about half of the cost of Twigby and without all the hassles (at least so far). Save yourself a future headache and go with someone else."

When I try to do the set up settings, the phone would not let me reboot to recovery settings & the keypad would not show on the screen.  The manual that comes with the phone is VERY INCOMPLETE!  Was on the chat online with several reps WHO STATED THEY R TECH SUPPORT.  None of them could resolve the issues I was having.  After wasting several hours, I ask for another phone since this one has issues, defects, problems.  Jon response was, WE CAN EXCHANGE IT,BUT U WILL BE CHARGED A $15 EXCHANGE FEE!  I informed Jon the following,  I WILL NOT PAY ANY FEES BECAUSE OF POOR PHONE SERVICE, TIME LOST, PHONE ISSUES, PHONE NOT WORKING LIKE ITS SUPPOSE TOO.  I ALSO STATED U WILL BE HEARING FROM MY BANK, FCC & THE ATTORNEY GEN ON THIS MATTER.  I should have received a manual that was complete/should not have to go to website for another incomplete manual , should have received a phone with no issues, like keypad not showing up or phone will not reboot.  Then they wonder why people get upset/mad & write negative comments!                               After writing this review, I have this happen.                     I received this email for $10 off next phone purchase.  Had problems today with your new BLU View 3 phone, with the following; won't reboot, keypad does not show up on screen.   WASTED SEVERAL HRS WITH THE FOLLOWING REPS; Annie, Jon, Harry, & Jon the manager.  NOTHING GOT RESOLVED.  Had problems on your web site to order another BLU View 3 phone since the one Twigby sent me is defective!   I also went to your web site for a more complete manual.  Since the manual with the phone I received IS INCOMPLETE, JUST AS THE WEB SITE MANUAL IS!I've also told your reps I am NOT PAYING FOR ANY FEES, EXCHANGE FEES ETC.  I ALSO REQUESTED MY $10 CODE BE APPLIED TO EITHER MY CREDIT CARD OR MY ACCOUNT, SINCE YOUR REPS WOULD NOT APPLY IT TO MY PURCHASE OF A NEW BLU VIEW 3 PHONE.  ALL I GET FROM YOUR REPS IS EXCUSES & NO RESULTS!I also inform your reps, I will be filing a complaint with the FCC, Attorney General & my bank if I'm charged with any exchanged fees & do not received the $10 off like this email states!"

In July I prepaid my bill and then received notice that it was an additional .20 more. I said okay let's see what happens next month. Sure thing I overpaid for August by an additional .20 more than last month and my phone is off because now they want an additional $1.64. They first told me it was for taxes and sent me a screenshot then when I told them $12.50 and the taxes came to $15.72 but I was being charged $17.53 I was told no I wasn't. When I stated I had already paid $15.89 and now my phone is off for an additional $1.64  which amounts to $17.53 I was told they recently included an administrative fee to defray costs from vendors/partners. I told them I was filing a complaint with the FCC and that's exactly what I did!!!"

          "Contenu": "Twigby offers service in our area so we thought we'd give it a try. We've been with them now for about two years. Neither of us uses a mobile phone to call or receive calls. Nearly all our communication is done via texting apps, email, or IM services like Signal. The few times we were out and about and wanted a map software service working via our mobile data plan, this wouldn't work for us. Twigby couldn't help us. Recently, for the first time in over a year, I tried to use my mobile phone to make a call. It \"failed.\" I remembered Twigby is my provider so I went to the website to see if there's a problem with my plan. Nope. I finally contacted a Twigby support rep who had me go through a series of settings. The problem? We use VPNs on our phones for privacy and to minimize corporate data harvesting. Apparently, this disrupts Twigby. We were asked to disable the VPN to use our mobile plan.We opted to terminate service with Twigby. Our privacy is worth far more to us than a spotty mobile plan, especially when the great bulk of our communication is already through other means. Very suspicious that a telecom company requires the ability to track users beyond what they already do--constantly monitor the IMEI/unique phone identifier. Two stars for pricing. But very disappointed Twigby won't work with our VPN.*******Reply to Twigby's Response********Since we don't use our phones other than in emergencies, we keep Airplane mode on. Whenever we've needed mapping software to guide us to an unfamiliar location, the software--including the OS-native mapping software--has failed. We recently tried to enable wifi-calling (the day I couldn't get Twigby to work). My iPhone threw a message that to enable wifi-calling, I'd have to contact Verizon. So that's not as simple as simply enabling the function in settings.Yes, Verizon has historically been rated highest on US coverage. But Verizon itself has told us that it deprioritizes network connections to its non-Verizon customers such as those using a service that has an agreement with Verizon to use its towers. The brief while we had Verizon in our neighborhood, our connections were flawless. As soon as we switched to Verizon-shared companies, our connection quality and reliability plummeted. And, respectfully, it's still unsatisfactory that to have a reasonably reliable connection to Twigby, we have to disable one of the few tech protections our family has to mitigate un-wanted data collection on our devices."

          "Contenu": "*Update: Did finally receive an email from Twigby. Sad that it took a review to get that to happen opposed to replying to the email sent directly to them days prior to the reveiw. The customer service is quite slow in getting a response via email so I am still waiting to see how it ends. I will try to update once it is completely resolved. I ordered a phone from Twigby to begin service with them. The phone I ordered was supposedly a \"certified\" phone. It was a Samsung S10e. When the phone arrived the back of the phone was not adhered as it should be. I contacted Twgiby customer service and was told to send pictures of my phone to a managerial email. It took several business days to get a response. the response accused me of having tampered with the phone and claiming that is would never have been shipped in the condition I recieved it. \"...We can tell from these pictures that someone has tried to remove the backplate from the phone.  We review all of our Certified phones and hold them to the strictest standards; so, the phone would not have left our warehouse in this condition.  \" This is wholly untrue. I received the phone in the condition I contacted them about - with the back plate being open. It has been five days from my response to them and I have yet to get a further response from Twigby after informing them that the phone was received in the condition I contacted them about. To make matters worse while I was waiting on replies from Twigby about what there were going to do about the phone, due to the loose back it got dropped and cracked, then dropped again and rendered completely useless. I had not yet purchased a case and cover as I was waiting to see what was going to be done about the phone. The situation is what it is, a little customer service would have gone a long way instead of accusing me of damaging a phone that I recieved from them in damaged condition. Their \"certified\" phones mean nothing pertainging to the quality you will receive. Extremely dissappointed and will now be looking for a new carrier to move all 3 of our phone numbers over to as we will no longer be using Twigby. Hoping others have had a better experience."

          "Contenu": "I had overall negative interactions across multiple messaging experiences with four of your CSRs, two of those occurring with the same CSR. I got so frustrated at the argumentative behavior of all your CSRs except the first, who I would give 5 stars, the rest 2 stars. I had to ask repeatedly about not having service, and suspecting problems with Verizon's network particularly that a person who has Verizon directly was at my home and did not have service and needed to use a VOIP on my laptop to call his wife as my cell (via Twigby) was down also. My cell was down more than 24 hours in all. Those interactions were so challenging because of your CSRs and I messaged in multiple times, and your CSRs, who typically are very responsive and not gaslighting, were just the opposite in the chats I copied, with zero cause coming from me though due to their behavior, I got frustrated to which your CSRs exacerbated their behavior and escalated the gaslighting, and did not de-escalate, all because Verizon's network was down. And I have received zero credit on my account for not being able to use my cell for those more than 24 hours and wasting so much time messaging with your CSRs when the cause of the problem should have been proactively communicated to me and any other Twigby customer so impacted. I am otherwise grateful to have Twigby not offshore their CSRs... thank you for that corporate decision. Mark S. Pirie, PhD6/23/2023: In response to the reply from Twigby-You would think that I would be notified if I received a credit on my account or I could see the amount of the credit if I logged into my account and looked at the billing history; I was not notified and there is no history of a credit that I could find. And this credit came weeks after the event. I had a credit on my account already, and if I subtract that from the current negative balance, I can calculate that $14 something was the amount of the credit, for about three hours of my time that I had to force your CSR to contact Verizon, that he initially refused to do which put your CSR and I on a negative tract from that point forward. Fourteen dollars credit for wasting hours of my time with contentious CSRs who do not see me, who gaslit me, who did not want to help me, who did not inquire about how long I would be without service, and who eventually hung up the chat on me--not a fair exchange, and I hope this is not how your company always treats its customers. The Verizon outage was not Twigby's fault... was it mine? Was Twigby put out by not having cell/text service or me, and did Twigby get CSR responses that were fully inappropriate to the situation or was that me, your customer who did? You have this backwards, sir/madam, I am your customer who was put out and your CSRs and you could not care one bit... typical corporate response. My loss of hours with rude CSRs in exchange for $14 and somehow Twigby is not responsible for their CSR behavior with customers and I should overlook the impact of my being without service for more than 24 hours, because weeks later, you credited me without telling me about your $14 credit. Did you even read the hours of messaging history before you so blithely apologized to me?"

I lost my old number in the process, and though blessing it turned out to be, Twigby was unable to perform its job properly. I give two stars because it could also have been the fault of Mint Mobile, my previous carrier, but I can say that 100% of my experience with Twigby has been sub-optimal. One thing that stood out to me as particularly awful was that they refused to process my refund until I mailed them back- at my expense- the SIM card they sent. Besides this, when I got a refund, they didn't refund all of my purchase.EDIT: Twigby claims they refunded the cost of my SIM card and service, which is probably true. However, when I asked if all of my purchase, including shipping, would be refunded, the representative said yes. Just in case I'm wrong, I challenge Twigby to pull the audio from the call and I will gladly type a retraction. My bank records indicate I paid Twigby $20.84 to expedite me a SIM card that failed to do me any good, that I paid $7.74 for shipping with tracking, and that Twigby refunded me $9.46. A company with integrity would have written off the negligible cost of the SIM card and issued me a full refund rather than blaming the out-transferring carrier and sticking me with the cost.EDIT: Twigby claims that Mint Mobile would not provide a correct account number to allow transfer of my number. While I cannot verify whether it's Twigby who is at fault or Mint Mobile, Mint Mobile repeatedly claimed that they provided the correct information. I challenge the two carriers to duke it out themselves; until then, I'd advise against both of them, but given Twigby's approach to a \"refund\", I'm inclined to trust their tech savvy less than Mint Mobile's, which at least provided me almost acceptable service for a couple of years."

She is on Verizon whose towers Twigby uses. I couldn't get a GPS signal. She could. Hm. That is disappointing. I still only have 2 bars and we are back to town. I'm traveling away from home where the towers may not be as strong, so...time will tell after i get back to the big city."

All text photos come in extremely low resolution and high compression, usually limiting their file size to less than 100kb. Forget trying to read text in a screenshot someone texts you, or the ability to see any level of detail in a photo you receive by text. It leads me to believe that they set this model up as a \"feature phone\" on Verizon's network instead of a smartphone. This is a flaw that will likely lead me to cancel service for myself and my family in the near future."

Cell service has been better than what I had, but with no increase in price.  The reason Twigby did not get 5 stars was because of the shipping.  I ordered on a Saturday and paid $18.50 for the fastest shipping.  My SIM card did not arrive until Thursday.  I think it would have arrived the same time if I had chosen the slowest shipping since it was just by USPS and came from TN to SC.  I'm really disappointed I paid the extra shipping fee for no real benefit.  Maybe not specifically Twigby's fault, but they could have been more forthcoming about who they used to provide their shipping.  It may have changed my mind. I was especially desperate because my phone was not working well with my previous provider and I was missing a lot of important texts.UPDATE:  Ordered a SIM card for my son the Saturday after I received mine.  I went with the free shipping and it took only one day longer to arrive than mine did when I paid for fastest shipping.  And that day could be accounted for by the federal holiday on that Monday.  So, do NOT pay for the expedited shipping.  It was a total waste of $18.50."

          "Contenu": "I just started service transition went relatively smoothly.  Detailed instructions need chat.  I have service and voicemail right now.  I gave 3 stars due to 1. A misunderstanding via chat that cost me some $ (Unlike Mint, you cannot insert a trial sim or use your Twigby sim on a trial basis without discontinuing your old service and losing your number.  Must go through full activation and port number.)  2. As a result of #1, I did not receive the full 50% discount promotion I signed up for.  Because I actually transferred my phone number, they will now give me the additional 25% discount on my plan but will not refund proportionate taxes and fees.  That brings me to #3.  Twigby's e.g., $15 plan is nearly $2.50 (in my county) more expensive than my former $15 RedPocket plan because Twigby charges administrative fees that are not specifically disclosed out front and are on top of the usual taxes and fees.  Also, they will refuse to give exact quotes including taxes and fees out front.  Their generic $3.50 quote significantly undershot my actual charges, which significantly overshot taxes and fees for my old plan.  I had to badger a rep to get a real breakdown of my actual statement charges (which is how I know about the admin fees).  I will give them a full trial of at least 6 months, barring other problems, but I am not inclined to do business with a company that is secretive about what they actually charge me.  Also, not refunding my overpaid taxes and fees is, I think, not legal.  I chatted with Scotty and Leah about the tax & fee issue.  Apart from the above, chat service was fast, reasonably polite and responsive.  As usual, you are stuck with the limitations of their training and knowledge and may need to ask the same question multiple times or ask for more detail when they give instructions.  No one offered to connect with a supervisor regarding my issues, so I don't know what would happen if, as with my last service, I am left without service or some other major issue.  We'll see.  Caveat emptor."

BUT the unlimited is $35 and gives 20gb of \"high speed data\" whether your on 4g LTE or 5G. Other than that it works well on Verizon network.

Everyone has been professional, knowledgeable, friendly, and sometimes showing a good sense of humor. I'm saving $60 bucks a month for 2 lines compared to the big 'V', and the cell phone service is better. No hidden costs or extra charges. I deducted one star because they don't have wifi calling which would be helpful in my rural, mountainous area. But I can live without it. Bottom line...Twigby service is affordable, reliable, accessable, and most importantly hassle free."

I still would recommend Twigby to everyone I know!!!!!  I only rated 4 stars only because my mobile data is so slow and laggy, but I believe it's only because of my rural location.

I did not see it until right after I signed up and when I chatted to ask if I could still receive it I was told NO.  If you offer it and it is before your first 30 days is up, you should still honor it.  The set up person I chatted with was great and very patient while I talked with Verizon.The last person I chatted with about bad LTE service told me to reboot my phone.  Not quite sure how he thought rebooting my phone was going to keep him in the chat.  Obviously when I rebooted the chat had been dumped. I am still on the fence about keeping service.  I will know in about two weeks.  The trial will be keeping service while on a 17 hour road trip.  Never had a problem on Verizon so we will see"

I have been a customer of Twigby for approx four years and have found the chat agents to be patient, helpful, and professional.

I am not alone and neighbors that have Verizon also complain of the same thing. We are in some sort of a dead zone in Los Angeles. While Verizon's weak signal is not Twigby's fault or problem, it is inconvenient when I can't get text messages to send. I also just discovered that the plans had changed. I don't know if we were informed about it in an email, which admittedly I never look at emails but that was a surprise. The other surprise was the administrative fee. I can usually deal with anything if I know about it but I didn't know why my bill had gone up a small amount and that was why. The customer service chat has always worked well and has been very helpful. I just hope that the Verizon signal improves."

The network service is great - we don't notice a difference compared to Verizon. And it costs about half as much. What really stands out though is how good the customer service is.  Each of the 3 phones I've switched have not immediately worked with the new SIM cards (i didn't know what a SIM card was when we started this). The chat feature is staffed by real people who really know what they're doing and have gotten us set up each time.  Very nice to deal with - nothing like Verizon."

And if I am thinking of some other company whose ads I reviewed and overrode for the final choice of Twigy, it will turn out that way in time as regardless Twigby itself is the best cover I could have for my new cell phone!!"

Just humans who listen and quickly solve the problem. (In my case, two plan changes.)Not to mention great prices and reception. Twigby is just so easy."

          "Contenu": "I got another replacement phone (for the replacement, that was not working properly). Evidently the original replacement is defective (somehow). It would call out and hang up, then answer and hang up, ut access to data, messages and the internet worked fine. I was originally told by Twigby tech support that the phone was 'locked' I took it to a Verizon store and verified that it was NOT 'locked'. Verizon network technical support directed me back to Twigby Support and told me to ask for Twigby network support. I got a bit salty with the Twigby rep (on chat, sorry about that), when the rep told me that the phone was 'broken' (before it was 'locked', but I could not get confirmation of the 'locked' status, until I took the phone to a Verizon store) So call me 'salty', if now the phone is 'broken' (again, sorry about that). Anyway, after transferring, everything to the 'new' phone, it is now working (yea and whew). I was told by the Verizon rep that the phone could not be 'locked', because it could send and receive data and send and receive phone calls (just not pickup and connect, phone calls). Perhaps, it would be helpful if Twigby support had some way to tell the difference between a 'locked' phone and a 'broken' phone."

One day before I requested to use Twigby as my mobile carrier and I thought I had done everything I needed to do on my end, but I never received an email confirmation with a tracking number, an additional service offered with a small fee attached.  Aubree pulled up my account and immediately offered to complete my order, which I accepted and appreciated.  She was very knowledgeable and able to quickly complete my order.  While we were still actively chatting, I received an email with a capture of my order and a second email informing me that the package with my sim card had been shipped.  I was so happy that Aubree was so good at her job and so helpful.  I researched so many mobile carriers before choosing Twigby, which is not a well known company, but I believe they will be a leader with employees like Aubree.  I look forward to a long relationship with Twigby.  I'm excited to get my sim card and start using the iphone that was gifted to me by a kind friend who was getting a new phone.  The company I had chosen before sent me the incorrect size of the sim card, so I didn't renew with them and didn't bother to bring the error to their attention.  I'm really looking forward to using the iphone and Aubree's great customer service will allow me to do so.  I asked Aubree if she could tell me where I might leave a review and she emailed this link to me.  THANK YOU AUBREE for your knowledge, your help, and your kindness.  YOU are appreciated!!!"
