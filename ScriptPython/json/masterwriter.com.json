It's not an app that runs with your favorite writing software. It's an online thesaurus and I already have access to plenty of those. The hype is exciting! I fell for it! But there's nothing there to get excited about."

Although the video that showed the tutorial, was very useful and inspiring, I thought, that was the perfect writing tools for songwriters, but straight after purchasing the monthly subscription, I was disappointed by the lack of choice I was given. I wrote a couple of songs which needed variations in terms of sentences and rhymes, but I could only find very strange suggestions or very little rhymes choice for a word. When I did the same search via Google search, I was much more lucky and could finish my songs. The algorithms are not working the way I was expecting, hence why, I wouldn't recommend this app and had to cancel my subscription after a couple of months trying to work my way round."

The only thing a song writing program is good for is organization and a rhyming dictionary. Other than that it's just a time-wasting tech tool.       The other big problem with Masterwriter is that you have to pay for it on a monthly basis. You should be able to buy the program and be done with it.         Another problem with Masterwriter is the design of version 3. In my opinion it really sucks. They would have you believe that all the changes in Masterwriter 3 are  major and important. In reality it's the same program as Version 2 with a few minor this and thats.         Don't be fooled! It's a complete waste of your time. Spend more time writing songs and less time tangled up in technology.  John Lennon, Paul McCartney and Bob Dylan did not have Masterwriter.  Study their songs not the technology of writing programs.       And finally the idea that you're going to write a novel or screenplay with Masterwriter is absurd."

These are my next comments about Songwriting Software.I do not like the new design of Masterwriter. The black design is annoying, at least it is for me.The new comments about writing songs versus building your vocabulary are a  large waste of time. I am just writing songs. I don't care about my building my vocabulary I just care about writing great songs, period!!!All songs come from life's experiences. So if you want to write better songs study your life's experiences.  Dictionaries will help you write better songs. Building your vocabulary is a nice idea but I don't use Songwriting Software to build my vocabulary I use it to aid me in writing songs.  That's all there is. Songwriting Software will not write songs but it can help you write better songs. The two things all Songwriting Programs should have, a great rhyming dictionary and a great thesaurus. These two dictionaries will help you write better songs. The mind, the imagination and the heart will help you create new songs.Songwriting Software can help you write better songs. All great songs come from the imagination, that's it. Writing dictionaries will help you write better songs. I wrote the dictionaries in Masterwrter and in the building of these dictionaries, it grew my vocabulary but it did not help me to write songs. Remember in the end, it's all about writing songs."

MasterWriter can be very funky and even annoying in how it performs basic functions - think Microsoft Word in the 1990s; it has a long way to go to be great.  An example, the search bar at the top has an \u201cx\u201d to delete current searches. You better have super accurate finger attack because it requires pinpoint accuracy to clear your current word search.  I routinely have to touch the \u201cx\u201d 4 or 5 times to erase my current search to clear it for a new search.   There are some cool functions, like organizing projects, Word Families and Speech Types.  I find myself too often going to Rhymezone for basic things like looking for synonyms by rhythm pattern (accent/unaccent) and for a broader array of rhymes.  When a viable alternative comes around I will be very open to a change."

Grammarly sits on top of whatever I write. So should Master Writer. It should offer alternatives to many overused words. It needs to check the work, not be a passive blob waiting to be used. I have used it for years and have seen it as a program fall behind as others have raced ahead in usefulness.Since Chat GPT and Bing, it makes the search for alternate words and ways of expressing a concept so much easier for me as a writer. This will make it even harder for Masterwriter. The best result for me as a writer would be for Masterwriter to be available in Grammarly. Grammarly offers alternate words, but its thesaurus is poor. I only need the thesaurus, I rarely use the other features of Masterwriter other than perhaps word definitions. AI is making research and so many parts of being a writer so much easier.

          "Contenu": "MasterWriter does have a lot of useful features for songwriters / lyricists BUT the decision to switch to a web only format \u2013\u00a0basically MasterWriter 3.0 is now just a website (not an app like MasterWriter 1.0 and 2.0 were) is a huge mistake. Most creative types need to get away from the distractions of the Internet to find their inspiration and do not want to be glued to it night and day. Bizarrely, MasterWriter 3.0 simply cannot be used without an Internet connection!  It is also hopeless trying to use MasterWriter 3.0 on a mobile phone as those screens are far too small to be able to do much with it. I am not the first person to feel this way. Many colleagues I know who loved MW have given up on it and switched to apps like Rhyme Genie etc. I hope the nice folks at MasterWriter are hearing this feedback about the website only shortcomings and will soon update MasterWriter 3.0 \u2013\u00a0or create a version v4.0 \u2013\u00a0to combine the essential usefulness of an app with that of a website. I really like the simple utilitarian design and look of MasterWriter. I just hope they bring it back as an app instead of just a website.REPLY TO MASTERWRITER'S REPLYBeing an online only website also comes with many disadvantages too. Most songwriters prefer to be 'offline' when creating and composing. The Internet is a huge distraction to the creative process. Please reconsider your stance and create a software version rather than it just being a website users have to pay to access.As for using on the phone? Phone screens are simply too small to be practical for this purpose. Even when using a laptop with MasterWriter the available screen size available is too small as it is split in half and feels very cramped compared to writing on Word documents for instance. So to be honest, it just feels gimmicky even having a phone app for this programme. Just a way of trying to justify the price of the subscription website only model that is being pushed."

Other than that, I do not get much help from it.  The help may be there but I am not one to spend hours teaching myself new software.  For example, as far as I can tell, the subcategories of Word families, Phrases, Speech types and the World serve a function but there is no help category to explain the purpose of those subcategories and how to use them.  The filter section is useful for nouns and verbs and useless for other categories like The World, but maybe I do not know how exactly to use it.  Strongly suggest you offer newcomers to your product a help/guide document that takes them through the various options of us that Master Writer offers."

I miss the old Version 2 that was an actual piece of installable computer software instead of just a website. I understand the push toward a website instead of offline software because it makes having a monthly subscription much easier, but it's just not as enjoyable to use personally.If I could buy it for life, I would do so.

Unfortunately, MasterWriter falls short. There aren't as many choices as I thought there would be.  Instead of using your program  when writing I find myself going to Urban Thesaurus, Reverse Dictionary, Relatedwords.org, the idioms page at the FreeDictionary, and the phrases page at RhymeZone. Those are all open tabs on my browser when I'm working. I did like the price that I paid for your program though. Hence, a third star. Hopefully, you'll end up incorporating the features that seem to be lacking and which would make MasterWriter a truly one-stop source for writers. Sincerely,Timothy"

I downloaded the app in hopes that it would mirror the web interface to an extent, allowing me to quickly access lyrics when I'm in a vocal session or being able to make changes on the fly. The functionality of the app is so limited, it's not really worth downloading in its current state. So much potential here though, would be amazing if there was a major update in the near future. 2) Web interface: Slow reaction times with Safari, blank menu windows. Noted several glitches when scrolling through the pages. 3) Colour customisability: Would be great to be able to customise the colour and break away from the blue.Hope this helps!"

The fact that there are so many tools available to me from within the MR application without having to scour the internet for rhymes, words and ideas is fantastic and really helps keep the momentum of writing stay constant. \r I would like to see some templates added that would allow a more professional outline and finished work in writing; spelling out main lyrics, choruses, instrumental interludes and codas. Maybe correctly adding the name of the composer, dates, copyright information, etc. Automatically adding the composer/writer name; setting up the font size and location for the title, etc. \r My biggest complaint would be that the subscription is way too high for an application that rarely, if ever, changes or is updated. I would prefer a stand alone, desktop app that is free of any subscription. Maybe has upgrade options to purchase for additional functionality, or some other value added service to make the subscription at least [seem] worthwhile. In ending, I love the Master Writer application. But after \"Years\" of use, and payments, I cannot really see the benefit of an ongoing subscription."

Another frustrating thing about this app is digging through some of the speech types, there can sometimes be 150 separate pages to sift through but no way to jump ahead or alphabetically search. Just endless page flipping. Other than these two things you guys are crushing it. Loving the app."

          "Contenu": "Disclaimer: this is a edit of a previous review.I use MasterWriter for songwriting, so I mostly search Rhymes. Ha. It's not fair to blame MasterWriter for not finding the rhyme I'm looking for. The app has a vast offering of perfect, close, wider, and widest rhymes. It runs rings round my Songwriter's Rhyming Dictionary. I haven't used MasterWriter much since it moved online. I prefer a standalone app I can open when needed without the online login process. Admittedly this is a personal bias which shouldn't color a review.The developer quickly replied to my initial review, which was short and not flattering. Honestly, I had forgotten about the app until I received a request to review it. Online apps are not my thing. My recollection was often not finding the rhymes I needed. (Please see the first paragraph.) Perhaps it was the process of searching that interrupted my writing--not a fault of the app. The developer's outreach prompted me to log in and take another look. I found a more robust version offering more content than I recalled. \"Speech Types\" is a new addition, with categories for Alliterations, Allusions, Idioms, Intensifiers, Metaphors, Onomatopoeia, Oxymorons, and Similes. That looks very useful, especially since you can filter by the number of syllables required.I'm going to give MasterWriter another try. I still don't like the online app process. But the site has many useful features. It looks like a one-stop shop for words. Users will have to determine if that is true for themselves. I'm giving it the second look it deserves.I've updated my rating to four stars. It may deserve five stars. I need to explore the new version before I can say. Will I use MasterWriter more now? Hard to say. I'm not often at my computer when I'm writing songs. Again, no fault to the online app.Bottom line -- the developer takes this seriously. Serious writers may benefit from  giving MasterWriter a look. How it fits into a writer's workflow may have a say in whether it is a useful tool or not. MasterWriter certainly has a lot of words to use. The developer's desire to help users is a big plus, as well."

          "Contenu": "I've upgraded my review from 3 Stars to 4. Matthew from MasterWriter has been very responsive. I sincerely hope they'll soon be able to bring back offline working mode for us songwriters who travel a lot and are away from Internet.  ***********I have used MasterWriter on and off since Version 1. I do have a soft spot for it and have tried to stay loyal to the company but I really do not like the fact it is now just a website and no longer dedicated software. You have to be online and tied to the Internet to use it. I think this is a big mistake and does put off quite a lot of people I have spoken to about it. In fact, no one I have spoken to prefers this new version to the older software version - which no longer runs on modern Macs. Many songwriters \u2013 myself included \u2013 crave time away from the Internet to be able to clear our heads and create away from its distractions. Another issue for me is the very cramped size of the writing area for lyrics. It is very small even on a laptop, but on a phone I find it not useable at all.  As I remember, the older software versions use to have an additional sketchpad / notes area where you could play around with your words in extra space before bringing across to the main lyrics area on the left hand side. Lastly, I really do not like the subscription model they have introduced. You are not even paying for software. You are paying a monthly or annual fee to access a website. I would rather pay for software that exists on my computer and then pay again for significant upgrades. There have been no major upgrades in Master Writer for many years -apart from the dubious one of it now being a website that you can access with your phone! I hope the folks at Master Writer take note of this feedback and bring it back as independent software. I am not meaning to be negative at all but I don\u2019t think MW has evolved enough since it was first launched many years ago. There is something I do still like about it but from a personal point of view its usability is now going backwards, not forwards with the demotion to being just a website and not freestanding software. PLEASE bring it back as software!IN RESPONSE TO MASTERWRITER'S REPLY:1. I do find it hard to believe there is overwhelming demand for a web-based program on a subscription model. I know a lot of creative people in the fields of music, photography and film and absolutely all of them resent being forced into the subscription model by the likes of ProTools, Adobe etc. as well as being unable to use their creative tools without being tied to the Internet. In regards to MasterWriter, the value of being able to work away from the distractions of the Internet (on a tour bus, airplane, train, remote cottage etc.) is far greater than the value of being able to access the website on a small phone screen. There is a growing resentment in the creative community \u2013\u00a0generally \u2013\u00a0that the subscription model is based more upon the financial needs of the software creators than the creative needs of the software users who \u2013 in effect \u2013 no longer own what they are paying for. Also, the fact that our work no longer resides on our own computers / hard drives but on someone else's hard drive (which is basically what the cloud and web-based apps are ... just someone else's hard drive). 2. Yes, I did notice that by hovering the cursor over the black separator bar I can pull the writing area on my MacBook Pro out to the right by approx. 1.5\u201d (4cm) which does help slightly. I agree with you, that the writing area on the phone is too small due to the limitations of the phone itself. My suggestion would be to revert to a software model where several full pages can be opened up at once \u2013 like Word documents \u2013\u00a0and exist fully side by side rather than the very limited real estate allowed by a webpage. 3. Agreed. The new \u2018Versions\u2019 feature is an improvement over the old sketchpad. 4. When using Versions 1 and 2 of MasterWriter I noticed there were barely any software updates over many years. Is there an area on the main website where we can see which updates and improvements are being implemented and where users can make suggestions for improvements? It would be nice to feel we are part of a community working together to improve MasterWriter. Lastly, a practical question. Does MW only send out text files in .html format? Could there be an option added in preferences where files could be sent in simple TextEdit format? As again, if one is trying to open up MW text files offline then .html format is of little use. Audio files work fine though. I wish to reiterate that I am a supporter of MasterWriter and have enjoyed using it since Version 1. I just want to help make it better and increase its appeal as there is still much I like about it. I also wish to thank you for being so responsive on this forum. Hopefully, the views of users can be taken on board for future upgrades."

Essentially, I was trying to create projects each time, rather than the dictionaries button. As I use Word for my writing, I just needed it as a search function, which is now working really well.Extremely impressed with the response and explanations, Masterwriter itself is really useful for any writers who need a wealth of words to choose from.

It's not based on AI (so-called \"Artificial Intelligence\"). Rather, it relies on making available all sorts of comprehensive, practical references and guides that, in my experience, serious songwriters use anyway. But MasterWriter brings them all together in a way that's fast, vast, and very convenient. It's not magic and it doesn't pretend to take over the lyric-writing process. The design is a bit \"old-fashioned\" in its look, but the functionality is 100% robust.I think it's best suited to songwriters who take pride in really crafting their songs in their own, unique way."

I've used it as a honing tool for my prose, poetry, songs, technical writing, and even simply to brainstorm new ideas in general. When I feel that nearly imperceptible dissatisfaction with a turn of phrase or a word that I know is close but not quite what I'm trying to convey, Masterwriter gives me many alternatives, both words and phrases, that will offer exactly the answer I needed, or just as often presents me with a whole new bank of ideas that gives the work an exciting turn I hadn't contemplated. Five stars for this unique program that does what no other resource can do."

So I decided to give MasterWriter another shot because I felt I might have a more descriptive direction to what I want to say and needed to find a creative rhyme and MasterWriter really has been an outstanding tool. So maybe the first time I was to impatient but now I am writing more and enjoying using MasterWriter."
