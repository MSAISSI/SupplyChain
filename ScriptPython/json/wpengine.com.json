          "Titre": "Handling of issues is very disappointing",
          "Contenu": "I have been a customer for about 2 years, I have some WooCommerce client sites but no complicated sites/use cases. Up until a few weeks ago I had one bad experience with multiple hours of downtime due to server issues (but that's not what this review is about).On November 8, 2023 I contacted support to talk about modifying my plan and then had a call about it. What followed was 5 stressful weeks of trying to get replies and solutions.Emails I was asked to sent apparently did not reach their recipient (it was later confirmed this was due to issues/mistakes at WP Engine). Almost no replies to the support ticket (even after almost 2 weeks of waiting), and no reply that actually solved the situation. Over the 5 weeks I opened 4 additional chats to ask what's happening and was told again and again that managers had been pinged and replies/solutions would come as soon as possible but nothing ever happened. I also called a number I was given, left a message but never got a reply.Since my plan modifications included upgrading to more sites and during the initial call it was confirmed this was going to happen asap, I made plans with clients, cancelled other contracts, etc... These 5 weeks cost me over 200$ for interim solutions, many hours of unpaid work, angry clients and one client lost.After 5 weeks I finally got an email and a call was scheduled. WP Engine apologized, admitted that they messed up with multiple things and took all the blame. I was told a few months of free hosting as a goodwill offer should be possible and so I agreed to staying with WP Engine (at this point only because of what my clients want).Unfortunately the \"goodwill\" was quickly reverted and was turned into a 100$ gift card (in this case value equivalent of a month free hosting) for some online shop in some other country, so useless for me.As of now I cannot recommend WP Engine at all. There are lots of hosting companies out there and pretty much all of them work great as long as there are no issues. The important thing is, how does the company handle the situations when issues arise and in my experience WP Engine completely failed in this case.I have also read similar stories before."

I was oversold on a hosting plan and could not get WPEngine to control their greed and charge me for a plan I belonged in. WP Engine's hosting service is overpriced compared to many companies with nearly identical service and support. My suggestion is that you do your best to avoid their sales department as they will steamroll you into services that you don't need. I have 50-60 visitors a day and they felt that I needed to be in their $ 1,050-a-month plan. There is no integrity or ethics that guide this company to do the right thing."

I am paying over $900 a month and desperately trying to downgrade and they won't let me. I opted for a custom 100-site server. They told me I needed to upgrade and get a bigger server when I had only 70 small sites because we ran out of storage! I decided to move all my sites to Kinsta which has been WAY better for performance. I now have 24 sites on my servers (yes... read that again... 24 small sites on a 100 site plan) and WPEngine is refusing to downgrade my plan saying my utilization levels require my 100 site server!I should be paying less than $250 for a 24-site plan and WPEngine is refusing to downgrade my plan that is close to $1000/month. That should be criminal."

He called right away and acknowledged that I was cancelling.  Now I'm being billed for another month at $665 minus 4 days. Thomas conveniently for WP-Engine never mentioned to me that I have to go sign in and cancel by myself or I'll get billed continuously.  Thanks a lot Thomas and the customer service crew at WP-Engine for being a rip-off for $1200 for over-sold product."

There are way better and simpler WordPress hosting options out that which with a couple of plugins give better, more robust performance and a more 'vanilla' maintenance experience. Used them on and off for years - really liked what they were about originally but they've pursued there 'unique' system down a blind alley and allowed their support to deteriorate beyond reason.

They have offered me $200 credit if I stay with them, however, I am leaving this service.Please be careful if you are looking to use this host - my advice is to avoid.

          "Contenu": "We recently decided to switch from WP Engine to Cloudways after a salesperson from WP Engine contacted us saying that we need to urgently upgrade our plan to a considerably more expensive one. The reason was that we were using too many resources on the shared server. The only proof that they were able to provide was an Excel sheet with the name of our website and the usage percentage next to it.The salesperson insisted that we needed to upgrade immediately, employing high-pressure sales tactics. Therefore, we decided to cut ties with this provider altogether.I would not recommend WP Engine since they are much more expensive than their competitors without providing any extra value. Plus, sooner or later, they will try to upgrade you to a plan that is 5x times more expensive than what you are paying now.After reading the other reviews here, I realized that many other companies went through similar experiences with WP Engine. Have I known this a few years back when we started using them, I would have definitely went with a different provider instead."

          "Contenu": "We've been hosted by WPEngine for several years with a small art website that never required the bandwidth we paid for. This year, we had an online sales event that we'd been planning since last year. We contacted WPEngine in advance several times to discuss the high level of traffic that we'd have at show opening and paid to increase our bandwidth significantly after considering their input and being told that would take care of it. Another small business owner we know had a website crash last fall under similar circumstances (with WPEngine) and we wanted to prevent that from happening. As soon as the show went live, the website crashed. While WPEngine was responsive and managed to get the site back up in about ten minutes, they immediately tried to upsell us multiple times to an account with a $2500-$3500 monthly fee. The one time we needed what we paid for, WPEngine didn't deliver and used that moment of high stress to try to upsell us to something we couldn't afford and didn't need. WPEngine promised the other company they had it covered (and then it crashed) and then we had the exact same experience.  We had a number of customers who missed out on one of a kind merchandise they wanted because of the website difficulties. It was our launch of a new concept and a number of frustrated customers contacted us and let us know they wouldn't be back. The following week, we began our research and as of today, we've moved to a different highly rated host company that is providing us more bandwidth, storage and service for half the price."

At first, everything went well, until the first month, when I started to be harassed by e-mails from a wp engine \"account manager\".They're desperate to get me on the phone to check up on my account. I refused, because I don't want to talk or need any advice. But the person persists, and sends e-mails every 2 days. Until one day they tell me that my site is consuming too many resources. (Even though I had the max plan before the personalised one) and I had contacted an agent and told him about my statistics and needs. He recommended this plan.I was told that I absolutely had to change my plan. Naturally, I asked why, and how much it would cost. (I was paying $300 a month)I was told that a personalised server would cost $3,600 a month. WHAT? At what point am I going to go from a 300 euro server to 3600 euros? I politely refuse by e-mail.They send me another e-mail saying they can give me a 50% discount. That's 1800$. (a nice margin nonetheless).So I took the liberty of leaving wp engine, and going elsewhere, for a better and much cheaper service.BUT THAT'S NOT ALL.Having several accounts with wp engine, I had an identical server, for testing, with no traffic. The hosted site was empty.Guess what? I received dozens of emails from a female account manager who insisted on talking to me on the phone. Telling me that my site exceeded the permitted resources.And unfortunately, on the internet, you can read many reviews similar to this one. It's really dishonest to do that.I don't recommend it. Unless you want to lose your money."

Their sales guys saw an opportunity to pitch a 'free' upgrade trial (beware the free lunch, of course), promised it was low touch/minimum to no changes required, we agreed, then the rath of additional changes came flying thick and fast, it was clear it was not seamless, nor straight forward, neither were they forth coming with the actual cost. Not until we got the upcoming invoice due, despite communicating with them on email back and forth, not to start the trial, they started it anyway, we get the invoice that says that package we didnt want, nor need was actually circa 10x my current package?! going from c\u00a3100/mth to nearly \u00a31,000/mth, to a package that was not required and more suitable for a high volume eCom store(s). What was more disappointing was on checking their site, there was a more and better suited package was available for c\u00a3250 (not \u00a31000!), that of course was not offered not once in any communication, even after they knew the product wasnt suitable, the customer expressed many times he didnt want or need it, and was unhappy with the proposal, and service. Who in their right mind thinks if a customer can go from a c\u00a3100/mth to \u00a31,000/mth 1) they would have done it already, 2) they could afford it, especially when 3) there is a more suitable feature, functional and price wise \u00a3250/mth package available? At no time, did the sales guys offer the more suitable alternative, and continued to insist on the upgrade. We however insisted. We advised Support, again, not to continue, and do the 'downgrade', thinking that was the end of the ordeal. Support then decide its a good idea to reply to my email and ask me a bunch of irrelevant questions, that sure enough, ticked down the clock that low and behold, guess what they debited our account for? Yes, exactly!This is snakes in the grass. They dont listen to their customers, doesnt matter if youve been with them for years. Stay clear of these snakes. We have heard good things about Kinsta, will be getting our refund and then leaving. Avoid these crooks. Take your money and business elsewhere."

Tried several times with this, backing up, uploading and so forth, with no luck what so ever. Then after like 5th try suddenly my page wasn't responding, and everything went full slide and wrong fonts and so on. This they couldn't help with, the only thing they would know how to do, was to do a \"fresh\" backup from before. I spent nearly three days back and forth with this s*** and now they want me to do a backup again. At this point, I felt my head exploding, and my inner Mike Tyson came through, wanting to punch these guys through the screen. Gave up on this horrible company and poorly educated support team, and asked for a refund.

          "Contenu": "I signed up for WPengine after speaking with a helpful sales guy (UK based). The server needed to include 2x installations of Wordpress, one for the website and another for the blog (it was actually a news site for SEO, but for the purposes of this review we will just call it a blog) www.(main)fistwpinstall.co.uk/(blog)secondWPinstall/  I was informed I could do this on the personal plan, no problem. Yey! On signing up, paying for a year on the personal plan with UK Data centre, I figure this is not possible by doing some research. I spoke to a colleague via the chat box to clarify, and they tell me I need to buy a Professional Plan unless I add an additional website (at an additional $14 a month) and add set up a forwarder on the DNS for the sub domain, not happy I use a second account (Which I purchased with the original order but was hoping to use it for another website, but this is a different story) So I install the blog and try to set this up via the DNS - Im struggling at this point so I speak to another Technical advisor via the Chatbox and he informs me, no, this can not be done! - As you can imagine, not happy at this point! I speak to the original chap on the phone again who advises I upgrade to the professional plan. A little unhappy, I ask to speak to his Boss. I don't understand why it is so difficult to add a second installation of WordPress on the server and why this is going to cost me an additional $700, so when you include UK data Centre this works out at $1500 total. I understand the benefits of using WPEngine; I get it! I just don't know how you can go from a plan that allows 1x WordPress install to a plan that accepts ten installs. I don't need ten installs; I only need 1 install and sub folder with wordpress installed for the website blog, how is this so difficult for WPengine to understand, surley most companies have this? why are you talking to me like I am the first person to ever ask this question. IN short, I have spoken with two people on the phone - employee 1x didn't have a clue what he was talking about. The other (his manager) didnt understand the point I was trying to raise, he was very abrupt and kind of told me to go away, they're not interested, \"The product is not for me, and I need to find another server, WP Engine isn't suitable for you riff-raff\" (he didn't say riff-raff, I made that up, but that was how I interpreted it. Secondly the support staff on the chat facility the first person did not have a clue, she took a long time to get back with replies, she must have been the 1st day on the job. She kept referring me back to blog posts for answers. She gave me the wrong advice and wasted a good few hours of my time. The 2nd chap I spoke to on the chat - in all fairness he was very knowledgeable, he shot from the hip, was very to the point and didn't skirt around any of the points I was raising. If any of the management at WPEngine are reading this I would ask that you, please look over this case, you very clearly have issues that need addressing. Some of your employees don't know the product they sell,  and you have a big gap in your service offering. I am now going to go back to the drawing board and try to find another server - a full 3/4 hours of my life wasted!"

          "Contenu": "We had been broadly happy with WPE after we migrated half our online presence to them at the beginning of 2020. The migration and onboarding were straightforward, their support team has always been great, and when we needed to upsize and add an extra layer of security after a few months the process was easy.However, this week we have migrated to a new provider (Cloudways) after some very opaque communications from our account manager.He contacted me a few days ago to say that our site is using up too many resources and poses a risk to sites on the shared server, including our own. I was told this was urgent. Naturally we took this seriously and wanted to address it directly. I asked our account manager three times for further information - to find out what the issue was and how long it had been going on. We're problem solvers and wanted to be able to prioritise practical time investigating (and hopefully fixing) the issue this weekend. The requested information would have enabled us to do so in a focused way. While intuitive, the WPE admin interface offers no diagnostic tools apart from a basic PHP web log, so without this information we could only guess at where to start.However, instead of providing practical information, our account manager only gave vague responses and would not put me in touch with the support team who had apparently flagged the problem in the first place. He was only interested in setting up an 'urgent account review' meeting. Although urgent, this account review meeting was scheduled for six days after the account manager's original email.The most specific thing the account manager mentioned was that we share our server with 150-200 other accounts. Having been paying \u00a3168 (approx $230) each month, I was a bit surprised that so many other websites might be competing for resources.During this email exchange, I contacted WPE's support desk and in the course of a brief text chat got some useful pointers from one of their support team, with some useful pointers for improving the health of our database (to be clear, their frontline guys are great and our decision this week has nothing to do with them). I don't think the support person who helped me could see any evidence of issues raised by the support team about our account, which seemed very strange.This gave me the impression that our account manager was not interested in helping us improve our website. The account review would not have looked at the site from a technical perspective. My guess is that he would most likely just have tried to upsell a more expensive package (a point he did not deny when I asked him). I have no problem being sold to, but only if the sales rep is being open about it. But if you're going to tell me your tech guys are concerned about our website, and that it is urgent, then please urgently put me in touch with your tech guys so they can say what they need to say. If something is urgent, help us do what we need to do to fix our site. Don't send us vague comments and defer the whole thing to a non technical meeting six days later.In the course of investigating the issues, we actually migrated a copy of the website to a Cloudways server on a three day free trial. Not only did the Cloudways facility give us (free) tools to start investigating issues, but from the outset the site ran substantially faster even on the basic setup offered by their free trial. Their facility, flexibility, price point, ease of migration, not to mention site responsiveness and the extra few points we earned on the Google Pagespeed Insights without fixing anything, are all a great challenge to WPE, so we have decided to stay. Not something I thought we'd be saying a few days ago, but there you go.The ease with which we have been able to move quite a complex website (it took only two hours yesterday morning) has been a good reminder of the importance of keeping our technical suppliers in competition - because changing them has not been an arduous process.I'm very disappointed in WP Engine. My initial experience with them was great. But the approach this week from our account manager was incredibly opaque.As a result they have lost a customer.PS - for others having doubts about WPE, Google throws up lots of WP Engine vs Cloudways comparison blogs, which are worth a look.PPS - the information above was shared with WPE when we closed our account.EDIT - I've just read the other 1 and 2 star reviews on here. It looks as though the tactics our account manager seemed to be adopting have been used on others, who have subsequently ended up paying more without explanation. Meanwhile, a huge number of 5 star reviews are tagged 'INVITED' and came in within a few days in November 2020. Call me a cynic, but maybe this says something about the work culture at WPE."

We are also constantly bothered by our \"account managers\" or \"customer relationship managers\" to upgrade our plan. Tech support used to be fast and helpful but now there is a bot followed by a chat queue so you can wait for generic copy and paste responses. You can also create a support ticket that gets a similar quality of response.Their metrics do not appear to be accurate except for use as a sales tool. They will contact you with claims of \"Exceeding Plan Limitation\" or statements like \"...this can place a heavy strain on the server and lead to performance issues, downtime, and errors.\" Every time we look at our data their number of visits is roughly 1.5-2X more than google analytics, and their bandwidth metrics make no sense.  If you ask for additional info you either get a csv in excel or a screenshot of bandwidth usage that is basically useless.Overall we would no longer recommend wpengine even for a basic website. There are many other managed Wordpress hosts with much higher limits on bandwidth and storage for the same cost or lower."

          "Contenu": "As a long-term client of WP Engine across multiple companies, it's disheartening to witness the decline in both service and performance over the years. WP Engine was once a go-to solution for reliable and high-performing WordPress hosting, but recent years have shown a noticeable degradation in these areas.Server PerformanceThe server performance, which was once robust and reliable, has taken a significant hit. Load times have increased, and the overall responsiveness has deteriorated, affecting not just the user experience but also SEO rankings. Downtime has become more frequent, causing disruptions in business operations.Customer SupportWP Engine's support, although accessible, has become increasingly ineffective. The support team often provides solutions that are either too generic or ineffective, leading to prolonged issue resolution times. What's worse is the complete lack of care in addressing customer concerns. Support tickets often lead to conversations with account executives who are more interested in upselling services than in resolving the issues at hand. This has resulted in a loss of trust and increased frustration among long-standing clients like us.Final ThoughtsThe decline in WP Engine's service quality and server performance is not just disappointing but also detrimental to businesses that rely on their hosting services. The lack of genuine customer care and the focus on upselling rather than problem-solving have further eroded trust. It's a far cry from the high standards they once set in the industry. Long-term clients have been left to reconsider their hosting options, as the current state of affairs is unsustainable for serious business operations."

          "Contenu": "I feel a lot of the reviews here are quite misleading, as WPEngine has a lot of proprietary features and has helped the Wordpress economy as a whole by moving things forward and acquiring quality companies (ex. deliciousbrains).However, I have slowly noticed the quality of things to go down slowly. I have been a WPEngine customer for over 8+ years now. First & foremost, over the past year I have noticed my installs have steadily declined in speed. While I continue using all the most up-to-date technology and little to no plugins. But this does not stop the recent degrades. Things like TTFB and the whole experience have begun slowing down.WPEngine has some stellar features others don't. Like Smart Plugin Manager. One of the best plugins that is very underappreciated. SPM is extremely helpful if you are running a large number of sites because it not only updates your plugins, but also does a visual scan on your pages to ensure they don't break. If it encounters a visual change, it auto reverts and emails you. You can then choose to take action, or wait a few days and the plugin gets another update that fixes the issue, and the SPM does its job.This is great if you have a large number of sites, or a very unsteady site with a massive number of plugins. WPE smart plugin manager is a godsend when you are taking in clients from other developers. As you don't have to ensure your whole website fails from upgrading one tiny plugin that hasn't been updated in 3 years.But outside of that one thing, their service has really begun lacking. Their extra charge for \"Global Security\" is a bit ridiculous, counting if you are already an ECOM customer. The upsells have gotten a bit out of hand pricewise and there are far to many.Everything from advanced site search, to new proprietary cache engines for ECOM sites, SPM, Global Edge security and that's just to name a few.Their new superpowered network isn't really a big upgrade either, just feels like it makes the site a little chalkier on load. The legacy network seems more stable.WPEngine has done a great job serving myself and my clients for the past 8+ yrs. Their SPM has been a lifesaver, but their cost isn't cutting it anymore. If I messaged WPEngine customer service 2-3 years ago I would have an answer from an engineer within minutes. They would go into my install and find whats wrong.The new support is very different. You very rarely get that developer anymore, often times you get the typical run around of \"disabling all plugins\" and other extremely basic stuff any professional has already tried. The support isn't what it used to be anymore.I have tried almost every Wordpress host under the sun and found WPE, while its price point was always bigger than their competitors, it was always the best. Hands-down, if setup properly it was blazing fast, secure and the best. But recently, things have taken such a turn for the worse I have migrated.Sad to see myself go as WPEngine continues to grow, I hope they just don't grow too large. Fairwell old friend."

I've had to store images on one site on Amazon S3, and they still chase me up complaining that I am over their threshold.I could understand if this was a \u00a310 a month service, but for over \u00a3100, I expect to not have restrictions as tight as this."

          "Contenu": "I have found the WPengine experience a mixture of brilliance and frustration. WPengine has been endlessly helpful in the process of migrating and improving my WordPress site with direct and knowledgeable personal support. My site also loads very, very fast. However, the pricing structure is less effective for me. My site is funded by affiliate commissions which naturally, require fairly high levels of traffic. Right now, I'm in a Catch-22 situation: if I get more traffic, I will have to upgrade my plan, which means much of the extra revenue from increased traffic will be swallowed up by a more expensive plan. I think WPengine may offer great plans for companies or individuals willing to set aside a marketing budget for a site with a different kind of revenue stream (or better conversion), but it does not work well for sites which depend on high traffic and affiliate revenue."

          "Contenu": "The host dashboard is good. It's easy to download backups, revert to backup, copy live site to staging site, add password protection to staging, and so on. The reason for mediocre rating is support. This comes in 2 forms: chat support and ticketed support.Chat support is hit-and-miss. Some people know what they are doing and want to find a solution. Others either don't know or don't seem to care. With all chat support, you're better off multi-tasking due to the long waits between responses, but that seems universal on the web. I've had some great chat support so overall, this would only bring the score down one star.The real downfall is ticketed support. Generally, issues move to ticketed support when it takes too long or is too hard for chat support. (You can't log into ticket support in the Chrome/incognito browser, by the way, or at least I can't.) Any ticket-item I've had has basically had zero support. Your site could be in flames and they probably wouldn't look at it for a week. (And that's just the initial look, not a solution.) So you end up trying again and again with chat support and hopefully you get a resolution there. In summary, it's a pity about WP Engine's support level (mainly ticketed support). The rest of the system/interface is good and much cleaner that what I've seen on the two other hosts that I've tried. For me, timely support is important so I'm actually considering a change to another host."

I cant recall any issues with websites down or server issues over that time and the technical support is the best I've had anywhere. In fact when they put their prices up last year I only stayed because of how good tech support is/In the past 4 years wp engine have been spot on delivering a great and reliable service - however, by far the best asset is technical support. I ring them or message them 24 hrs and someone is there to walk me through issues - almost immediately. Technical support is critical when dealing with large numbers of sites and the level of back up offered have definitely helped us expand.I also like the fact they specialise in wordpress - this is a great fit for comp[anies that specialise in wordpress technology.The downsides?The pricing. Last year wp engine went from 10 installs to 5 installs for the same price, essentially doubling their price.This means that although I'd recommend them on service, look carefully at pricing before you commit."

          "Contenu": "WP Engine's support is no short of outstanding: For the past two years I've been with them, I've always dealt with really competent and friendly support guys where nothing was too much trouble. That, for me, always justified the high end hosting pricing. I still have 15 other \"minor\" websites hosted on OVH, which at least do not need the garanties and security provided by WP Engine. And when you come from OVH, you know what it's worth to have someone jump in within less than 10 minutes when you're having an issue. With OVH, you can wait up to 5-7 days until someone shows up to give you a standard copy/paste answer. So I really appreciate WP Engine's support. The price hike though was not necessary I think. WP Engine already offers pricey services (in terms of bandwidth and hosting, their prices are in average 5x higher than other competitors). My website is on autopilot and isn't memory intensive. I also don't use support that much (maybe once every two months). Another negative thing: WP Engine doesn't accept PayPal payments. And for users based outside of the US, this means that we get a $20 conversion fee from our bank on top of the subscription we pay every year to WP Engine. I think it would be fair if WP Engine gave us $20 back in credit if they're not able to offer PayPal as a checkout option."

And they do it all without making me feel like an idiot noob. At first I thought their pricing was nuts, but as my client base grew and I no longer had the luxury of spending hours on hold with a budget host, the more of a deal WPE became. I now have 20 sites with them and wouldn't think for a second about moving them anywhere else."

          "Contenu": "I've been using WPEngine for several years now and can vouch for them as the best option for Wordpress hosting. I've used a few other options out there and WPEngine always comes out on top. Their prices are not overly complicated or high. They provide several features accessible from the web for those less tech-savvy folks, as well as ssh if you really need the nitty gritty. Though often times I find myself not needing to do that because the controls on the user portal side are so simple and easy. Also I rely heavily on the customer support which is a quick chat feature on the web. Sometimes it can take 15-20 minutes in line to talk to someone, other times there's no line. You do need to get through the AI chatbot which wants to help you instead, but this is easy to overcome by typing \"support\" and providing your pin. Customer support is always very friendly and attentive to whatever I may need or however dumb my questions may seem. Typically my problems lie with my servers not synchronizing from prod, staging, or dev and this is usually a simple fix on their part. I also love that SSL is built in whenever you need it, making what can be a monumentally cumbersome task become a couple minutes of setup and automated beyond that. Obviously I cannot recommend WPEngine enough and this is in no way a paid review. I am totally serious about my fondness for them and will continue to use them as long as Wordpress is still a major player in the web world. Thank you!"
