It's even much higher than that outside the bank system.For my surprise, the only amount received by Vodafone (my cell company in Egypt) was ONLY EGP 140.00!! ... What is that?!! I'm sure the huge difference was NOT the processing fee, because I paid the processing fee in addition to the US$ 8.50. So, where is the rest of the money?!!."
