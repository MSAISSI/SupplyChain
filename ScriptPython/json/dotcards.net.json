          "Contenu": "Super Disappointed. I thought this dot.thin would be a seamless and eco-friendly way to share our organization's business cards. Instead, the majority of the phones will not scan the cards. Customer support will charge you $5 \"restocking fee\" to return the item, even though it doesn't work. It will work on the new phones, so they consider it not defective, but they expect you to ask each person if their NFC is turned on and make sure they do this and that in order to read your Dot. People don't want to mess with all of that. It certainly isn't as simple as tapping and going like they claim. I can't believe we are being charged this restocking fee. It's a good idea, but this isn't working."

          "Titre": "Useless Information in Contact Card and Multiple Steps to Save a Contact",
          "Contenu": "The idea behind this card is great.  But unfortunately, dot pushes extraneous information to the recipient of your contact card. When your contact taps your card or scans your QR code and attempts to import your information, they also receive a URL to your dot profile.  This extra URL is shown above the URL for your business.  There is no way to prevent this URL from being sent so your recipients see both your business URL and your dot profile URL.  This causes confusion for those looking at your contact information.The return policy of the company is horrendous.  I wanted to return my cards because in my mind they are useless because they push the extra URL that is not needed.  But returning the generic card would have resulted in a restocking fee. And even though my custom cards were not yet printed, they would not let me cancel my order.  The useless cards and the terrible return policy is why they are getting a 1 star rating.I emailed back and forth with a customer service rep named James.  He was very pleasant and helped as much as he could.  He said he forwarded my request to provide the option to remove the dot profile URL from the contact card to their development team.  If this feature becomes available, I would switch my rating from 1 star to 4 stars.There is 1 additional issue that would limit them to 4 stars instead of 5 if they add the feature I mentioned above.  The additional issue is that when the recipient taps or scans, they are brought to the dot site where they must go through several clicks to save the contact.  They must click save contact, then click save contact again, then a file is downloaded and the user must click to open the file, at that point the contact card is opened and the user clicks Import.  That's a total of 4 clicks for the user after the card tap.  So it is not the simple tap and store that you see in the promotional material."

BTW, Android users need to have their NFC (near-field communication) option switched on, so imagine you\u2019re with a customer/client and you have to first start fishing for the sweet spot and then query them about whether their NFC option is on or off. Lol\u2026 not going to happen. I asked for the return/refund info and was told that because it was taken out of its packaging, that would deduct $5 from the purchase price. Then, because I didn\u2019t immediately try everything described above to get this thing to work within 40 days, I was told that the refund was no longer available. Hilarious.

          "Contenu": "1 is likely too high for this operation.  It seems like a great idea - And, the idea of getting away from business cards seems to have some merit.  However, with this company, the plot thickens.  You place an order - For, something (I imagine something specific that you actually wish to purchase) - They hammer you with crazy high fees to get your items any quicker than what took me two weeks for regular postal delivery.  Fair enough so far.  They can't control postal deliver times, to an extent - But, when it takes well over a week to package items, something is off.  The items that they send don't come close to what you ordered.  If you ordered 5 orange cards - There is a high probability that you're going to receive 2 Blue Index Cards or some other random office supplies that they picked up from around the office.  In my case, I received fully HALF of the items that I actually ordered.  I reached out to \"customer service\" and I received a response back, via email that said - And, I quote - \"We are human.  We make mistakes.\"  That's it!  A statement that identifies the company as being human and a reminder that humans make mistakes.  How is this helpful?  Clearly, I now wish to return what I didn't order and I'm looking for a FULL refund.  I send two more emails with nothing but canned, auto-response.  This once very human company all of a sudden cannot find a human anywhere to reply to your refund request.  Finally, it comes in - No, wait ... There's more.  Now, you have to pay for return shipping.  YOU - the customer that received less than half of what they charged you for - And, didn't receive your order - YOU have to fund the cost of sending it back and then they'll process the refund - Less their processing.  This company, far as I can tell, is simply a scam/rouse operation to charge people processing fees.  Terrible.  Terrible.  Terrible.  STAY AWAY - There is something suspiciously criminal being done here.  I've never worked with a company, or had business dealings with a company, that cared less for their customers."

          "Contenu": "I regret to express my profound disappointment with the services provided by dot.card. My experience has been marked by a series of issues that have left me utterly dissatisfied. Several aspects of their service have been particularly concerning and have significantly impacted my confidence in their offering.First and foremost, the absence of reliable customer support has been a glaring issue. Despite their claim of providing email support, I have submitted five separate inquiries that have gone unanswered. This lack of responsiveness has been frustrating and has left me feeling unheard and unsupported.Furthermore, my attempt to cancel my subscription was met with an unexpected obstacle. The response I received indicated that a refund was not guaranteed, even if I were to bear the cost of returning the card. In addition, the imposition of a $5.00 charge for returning the card is not only unexpected but also exacerbates the overall unsatisfactory experience.Attempting to voice my concerns through a negative review only led to further frustration. An email I received in response seemed automated and did not align with the issues I had outlined. The instructions provided in the email were inconsistent with the information available on the website, creating confusion and a lack of clarity.To compound these problems, using the card itself has been an exasperating experience. Instead of connecting to my intended company, the card inexplicably linked to an entirely different entity. This discrepancy raises serious questions about the reliability and accuracy of the service dot.card claims to provide.In light of these issues, I feel compelled to warn others about the shortcomings of dot.card. The lack of effective customer support, discrepancies between communication channels, and the card's failure to function as intended are all significant red flags that potential customers should be aware of.In conclusion, my interactions with dot.card have been far from satisfactory. The numerous problems I have encountered, combined with the lack of responsiveness and clarity, have led me to question the integrity and reliability of their service. I strongly advise individuals to exercise caution and consider alternative options when evaluating their card services."

          "Contenu": "Shoddy product with GARBAGE customer service.I ordered both the standard Dot Card, and the Dot Thin (designed to go under your phone case). The Dot Thin successfully connected to my Dot Profile, but none of my friend's phones could successfully scan it. Additionally, the banner image I uploaded to my Dot Profile always appeared blurry/pixelated on mobile devices. Since the main purpose of the product is to bring up your profile on people's mobile devices, this is a significant issue.I emailed Dot Support about both issues.First off, I've never seen a US-based company that takes as long to reply to support requests as they do. Their average response time with me over the course of these exchanges was 4-7 days. Shameful.When it came to the pixelated banner image, their first response was in reference to the dimensions I should use. The dimensions they provided were incorrect. Using the dimensions they suggest, the top and bottom of your image will get cropped off. The profile doesn't allow for repositioning of your banner image either, so you can't even control *where* your image would be cropped off. I used my browser's inspector to find the actual dimensions of the image, and no matter what resolution I created my image at, it still appeared pixelated, but only on mobile devices (the main platform where people will view it).In response to my issue with the Dot Thin, they suggested that I was probably trying to tap it incorrectly, and referred me to the introduction video, which I'd already seen and referenced back to when I experienced the issue. They also suggested that I use the Dot Profile's QR code as a backup. I knew that was an option, and I explained that that wasn't my issue; rather my issue was with the product I'd paid money for not working.When I replied with all this information, they didn't answer back with anything about the banner image. They asked me to send them a video of how I was tapping using the Dot Thin. I did so, showing that no matter which way or position I tapped it, it would not work. I also showed that I was following their instructions (phone screen on, tapping in the \"sweet spot,\" etc.).They insisted that, since it was successfully registered to my profile, the product must be fine, and that it was user error, but that I was welcome to return it, or I could exchange it for the bigger Dot Classic. I replied that I wasn't interested in the Dot Classic, but that I'd accept a replacement Dot Thin if they thought that would work properly. They also repeated the same instructions in regard to the pixelated banner image, suggesting the same incorrect image dimensions. I told them that I didn't feel I was being heard in reference to that issue.They basically just sent me the link to return my Dot Thin with the note, \"Sorry to see you go.\"The last time I tried to use the standard Dot Card with someone, THAT didn't work either.Shoddy product (that THEY won't even stand behind), with completely awful customer service and support. I really had high hopes for this product, and now I just have regret for not looking into some of the other options out there first."

The ease with which links can be edited and adjusted is a game-changer for someone like me who relies on quick and efficient networking. It's a basic design, but that simplicity makes it incredibly user-friendly. (My biggest wish would be the ability to upload a graphic for \"websites\" to help ID by graphic not just title.)Setting up the card was a breeze. The straightforward process ensured a hassle-free experience. The DOT band fits comfortably, and the snap is secure without being cumbersome. If I had to express a personal preference, a slightly thinner design would be ideal, although the current thickness is by no means a significant concern.What truly sets DOT cards apart is their affordability and practicality. I find myself recommending them to colleagues and contacts regularly. The price point is excellent for the functionality you receive, making it a valuable tool for professionals."

Not only that, but she later helped me set it up and guided me through things quickly to get it up and running for me that day.  Not a big techie and with her help, it couldn't have went smoother.  Easier than I thought. Just wish everywhere treated their customers like she did!  So far, I love the service and the product!!"
