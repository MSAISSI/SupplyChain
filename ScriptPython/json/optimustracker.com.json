The employee for the company called me to troubleshoot and was nothing short of a smartass on the phone. Rude, and short. Also told me it hadn\u2019t tracked in 23 days and why am I just now calling. This hit a nerve with me! My father has been in the hospital critically ill and this tracker was the last thing on my mind. Now that I have the time to follow up on it, I\u2019m going to get a smart mouth attitude who wanted to argue me on the phone. I am really tempted to cut off service find another company but I will attempt to talk to someone else from the company before I do this but I suggest that this company starts recording these phone calls and maybe they will see how their employees handle calls. I told him I would call back tomorrow to talk to someone else other than him, His name was Joseph and I talked to him today, May 30th around 12:30pm and the call came from a Texas. I highly suggest that he never call me again. Thanks! J Plaster"

I think it defaults to use AT&T which does not work well near my house.  Customer service personnel were nice and sent us a new one with Verizon programmed in.  It is better now but still drops connection on occasion and may take a day or two to reestablish.  I live in the city limits but bordering the country so that may effect the connection."

I think it's good for the price but if you want something on point and spectacular you'll have to put some money into it."

The Optimus device has the advantage of other uses similar to the Spot Tracker where you could take it on a hike or bike and friends and family could track you. Depends on what you want but the Optimus is a very good product."

As for the application, it could use a couple of enhancements on the reporting features, particularly, in the History inquiry, where a clock is displayed for you to input your inquiry. I find that a bit clunky, but not a big deal given that in the end, the tracker does what is supposed to do. And for those instances when I think there could be an issue, I contact their support team or my vendor and the matter is clear within minutes."

I do recommend Optimus Tracker because even though some problems may occur, their staff will be there to fix it.(Updated)Aug 25, 2021At first they were quick to help. Responds from emails were coming within minutes. Now I am receiving about 1 email per 24 hours. I'm am having issues for the past 5 days and is still going on. The tracking service I paid for an entire year keeps canceling on it's own everyday. I had to send emails to Optimus Tracker to fix it. It was fixed for the first 3 days but now the tracker has been inactive for the past 2 days and still on-going. Its quite disappointing. Due to poor services, I would not recommend this tracker to anyone.Aug 19, 2021Optimus Tracker support is great. They are very quick to responding to emails and helping customers. And the tracker works well and battery is true to the description. Recommened. Works well enough that I just had to buy 2 annual subscriptions. :)"

I was surprised to find a person to speak with, instead of a recording directing me to a website. The service was excellent.The accuracy of the tracker is outstanding. It drops breadcrumbs, or whatever they call them. The cellphone app is easy to use.The GV75MG is designed to be connected to power; however, it has a backup battery that's main purpose is short term backup. I needed to use the unit for a short trip without a power connection. I called Optimus to see if there was a way I could extend the battery life. The company successfully sent a command to my unit which allowed the tracker to completely sleep while not in motion. The tracker accurately detailed my location for 180 miles to the destination. The vehicle was moved a few times during the next three days. Those moves were recorded. The tracker lasted approximately 60 miles on the return trip. I believe that's excellent for a unit that has a backup battery that I was using for an unintended purpose. After the trip, I called the company and they remove the battery saving command. They have GPS trackers that are designed to be used without being connected to a battery."
