It is an irreplaceable vintage Shure cartridge that there are no original replacement needles available. It is shameful to treat valuable irreplaceable items like that. That needle can only be replaced with questionable aftermarket products and will never have the same sound"

But was offered no such thing. Worst customer service. Not apologetic about the mix up."

The customer service agent said that as long as I had my husband ID and that my ID had the same last name and address as my husband then I could pick up the pawned item. I went to the Robbinsdale mn location and attempted to do just that and was being helped by a nice man.  All of a sudden this woman came over and said \"what's up \" I explained that I was paying to retrieve the pawned item and she rudely said that I couldn't unless I had a marriage certificate.  I explained that I had called ahead and was told that I could show my ID and if it was the same last name and address a wife could retrieve the item.  With out looking at the matching address she said they were wrong.  Very rudely I might add. She said to tell my husband to pick up his own stuff.  I left very frustrated. Also I had come there a week earlier to pay $50 on the pawn and they would only let me pay the interest no anything extra.  Horrible service and will never go there again."

          "Contenu": "Yesterday, I visited a store to sell two nearly unused guitar amplifiers with excellent condition. However, I was taken aback by the online quote they provided, valuing each amplifier at a disappointingly low price of $80. As I needed to contribute to an emergency fund, my options were limited, and I reluctantly proceeded with the transaction. Additionally, I also brought along a snowblower for evaluation.Upon arriving at the store, the staff member informed me that they would only offer $70 for both amplifiers combined, which was a letdown considering the already underestimated online quote. To make matters worse, the staff member displayed unprofessional behavior by rudely shoving the amplifiers back at me when I declined their offer. Although frustrated, I informed them about the snowblower I intended to sell.The staff member then inspected the snowblower and proceeded to search for the serial number. To my dismay, they intentionally wiped off the serial number sticker with their thumb, rendering it illegible. Despite having recognizable traces of ink and mud on their thumb, they asserted that they could not accept the snowblower without a serial number. This deliberate act of tampering with my personal property can be considered vandalism, preventing its sale anywhere else. Importantly, these incidents were witnessed by two individuals accompanying me.As a customer of various establishments for over three decades, I have never encountered such mistreatment and disregard for professionalism as I experienced at this store."

Why would one person tell you something and another tell you something completely different? So I was under the impression by what the 1st person told me that my item would be fine. Well guess not and now most likely will loose my item because they would not except the one month interest payment.

I had to have this P.C. for work so returning the item wasn\u2019t an option. They did offer for me to return the device, but I would have to pay for return shipping. They would not reimburse for any value of the device despite their miscommunication about the product. They only offered a return that I would have to pay shipping for, probably another $50.

The mgr wasnt even willing to give me 70.00 and have me fax over the receipt the next day on the strength of I was a former customer of the prior owner.  I ended up selling this phone on craigslist for 100.00 so it was their loss. But I wouldn't do business with liars."

They is not at all how any jewelry should arrive. I\u2019ve made management aware but it still keeps happening. I\u2019m only writing this in hopes that something will change as I do not like spending my hard earned money to receive a tangled mess. When purchasing a necklace I\u2019d advise to send an email requesting it be packaged so that it arrives usable. Lastly, I do want to say I\u2019m very happy with the other jewelry I purchase and this rating does not reflect all stores et cetera. Kindest regards, James"

They lie on the phone too. Update: 12-30-18 Liars and cheaters. They do not send metals in to be melted down. That's a lie. They resell everything as evidenced by the ugly jewelry they have in their jewelry cabinet.  (0riginal post) They do not purchase items at fair market value and they do not sell merchandise for fair market value. What really got to me was the deception, the lying.

He wanted me to send it back and then get a refund and then re-purchase it at a store over 125 miles away from me. At that point I don\u2019t trust them to do so.. when I called to complain about it they hung up the phone and were told not to talk to me anymore. Seems weird that it didn\u2019t exist for two years even though they included a pre-printed out card that look brand-new to me.. but at first I was told they don\u2019t do it for eBay orders. I wish I could describe how I was treated it was just awful.."

I recieved my ps3 and it was broken the remote was dead and it didn't play any games or DVDs. I felt they knew they gave me a pos from the start. But that was just the beginning I went to my local pawn america to return it cause a pawn america is a pawn america right even though I bought it online. So I walk in and they tell me since it didnt come from their store that they can't refund me my money. But if I want I can buy a ps3 from them, so your telling me I can't  get my money and you want me to purchase another one?? Jeez what a company. Eventually I did get my money back but I will not be back just saying. I hope this review helps someone out there, and if you are offended by said review move along."

Either way I was pretty depressed when I opened the box and found this out.  I looked back at the photos and saw the bolt so my fault for trusting it was in decent shape.  Had the tripod head been in decent shape then that would have been an excellent price."

I know you need to make a profit to stay in business but your buyers need to purchase the merchandise at a lower cost.

I looked closely at the pictures and saw nothing alarming (apparently they had used stock photos). So I purchased it. When I went to pick it up, I was stunned. There was electrical tape wrapped around the flex joint. The stuffing was falling out of the shoulder straps and back support. There were still leaves hanging off it. Took it outside to see how it ran. After 6 pulls it finally started but the starter rope recoil failed to wind the rope back up. I refused the product. When I asked about my refund I was told (very politely) that was done through a different store. \"They might not answer the phone though because they are moving\" I did however find the credit had been applied to my card inside of 5 days so that was the bright spot of this transaction."

I also called the store to double check about the product asking if there was any cosmetic or internal issue, I was told it looks pretty much brand new and nothing is wrong with it. So I bought it and I will admit there shipping was great, I got it the next day. After using it and setting it up I went to download an app for taking notes for school. That\u2019s when I realized there was no windows App Store on the computer. And even when going to the online website I could t download anything. So I went to the Microsoft website and a tech person took over the computer and messed around for over an hour before telling me they don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong. They said if I factory reset it, it may work. I did that and it still didn\u2019t work. So it wasn\u2019t a great experience. The only reason I\u2019m not giving it 0-1 stars is because the employees were very respectful and helpful, and the shipping was fast, and because I understand they aren\u2019t really able to test everything when accepting a used laptop. But I was still very disappointed with it having the wrong product listed and things not working great."

Are the stores so lazy or stupid that they cannot even clean a ring before they send it out, there was so much tag goop on the ring and crude build up in the ring I am amazed it looked so good in the photos.  Sure I could just went to the store down the road and ask darling Susan if she would clean it up for me , but isn't that what the sending store (Rochester) should have done before even thinking about putting in the box, do they need the sales or the commission that bad they cannot take a few minutes to clean a small piece of jewelry up.  The condition of the ring was fair, although one of the bagette sapphires had been replaced with a stone that did not match, shabby work. I know it is used but the inside edges were pretty pitted out, so lots of wear , not just gently worn.  Good thing I did not use that big $20 coupon on this purchase or I would really be out\ud83d\ude43 So now the question, there another ring online I like , do I drive 50 miles across the city to save myself a headache or take a chance.......I hate headaches.  Don't be in such a hurry to get that sale out the door, look at the product, it that what you want to get in the for your hard earned money\ud83e\udd75\ud83d\ude08\ud83d\ude13\ud83d\udca9"

About 17 days after I received it I went into my settings to see how much memory I had left after downloading all the games I wanted in uploading my accounts to it only to find out that I in fact did not buy a 256 GB hard drive I actually bought a 128 GB hard drive and of course it was after my 15-day return time unfortunately so a long story short I bought a used Oculus Quest 228 GB which retails for about $250 to $300 for $250 not the Oculus quest to with a 256 GB hard drive that retails for $350 to $400 for $250. I unfortunately feel like I was ripped off and Powerless to do anything about an item I purchased that was falsely advertised prior to buying the Oculus I did not know how to check the amount of memory that the unit had and honestly I didn't think that I needed to because after reading reviews for Pawn America I was confident that I would receive the item that was advertised and unfortunately when I did discover that I had not received the item that was advertised it was passed my 15-day return time period so if anyone else purchases an Oculus or any other item that has a advertised amount of memory you can check to make sure by going in to the settings and going to the storage and there it will tell you how much memory you have used out of the amount of memory you have. Hopefully this will help someone else from the disappointment I experienced. I don't think that I will be doing any more business with Pawn America at least through the website if I do it will be in one of their locations that I can physically go to so I can see and inspect the item that I will purchase to eliminate having to hope that I receive the item that I have thought to have purchased. But on a positive note I did receive the item in a decent amount of time it was packaged great and the item worked great as well unfortunately I only have half the amount of memory I was supposed to have on it and there is no way to add memory to the unit nor can I buy an external hard drive to help with that problem."

BUT, the product I bought... not so much. I did know buying a \u201cUsed MacBook\u201d from a pawn shop was kind of iffy to begin with, but I said hey let me give it a shot cause I\u2019ve seen some decent reviews and I only needed the computer for basic functions. To start the computer was the same exact one in the pictures and the description read it was in \u201cGood Working Condition\u201d , not so much.  When I turned on the computer it came on fine but when I started to use it , it kept shutting and restarting when I would click on different apps. I looked up troubleshooting and decided to just bring it to a Apple store because they\u2019d know more than me. Well.... to begin Apple store technician let me know the battery on it would need replacing and that it also needs another new part that would cost about $500 and that was \u201cIf they could even send it because the style MacBook was on the older side to where it may be obsolete\u201d. The technician plugged in my computer and ran some diagnostics and found out that the computer was actually obsolete and the product numbers didn\u2019t match. So long story short the previous owner replaced the bottom of the MacBook with a newer cover in order to sell it that shows a different product number (than what the actual computer was saying because the original bottom showed the obsolete product number and it won\u2019t sell). I\u2019m not sure if the store was aware of this before listing it but hopefully no one runs into this problem. I will now be buying a newer MacBook from the Apple Store."

          "Contenu": "I saw a power washer on the website.  I tried to use the phone link to ask a couple of questions,  but after listening to their Covid response messages (five minutes) I pressed 1 and got \"I didn't understand \" and the message started over.  After three times listening to this I went to the store myself.  No place on the website  does it say the retail sides are closed, nor on the message i got to listen to thee times.   Ok.. I fully understand that these are strange times and unusual situations, nobody had plans for this.  The man at the pawn counter did his best to answer my questions but  informed me I could not pay at the store, it had to be online.  Seemed strange to me but new laws mean new issues.  He gave me a more direct number to the online sales person.  This rep also thought that the store could take payment. He called the manager and the purchase had to be made on the website.   Fine.  I pulled up the site on my phone and made the purchase while standing in the store.  At this point a person I assume is the manager comes out of the back to rather rudely inform me that the purchase must be made online.  I said, \"I understand.  I have just made the purchase. The sales rep said that if you called him he could confirm the payment so I won't have to wait an hour for the normal conformation to come through.  Would you be willing to do that?\"  She said, \"Well who did you talk to?!\"   I replied, \"Sorry, I didn't catch their name.  It is the person you just spoke to about this. \"   She came back with, \"well I spoke with two people!\"  I gave a shrug as I couldn't really help with that.  She walked back into the back area, and after 10 minutes or so returned. \"This is the only time I will do this! From now on you will have to wait the hour to get the item!\"  She gets the pressure washer on a hand truck,  wheels it out to the public area sets it down and says \"here you go.\" So I get to handle the dolly with my bare hands, she had gloves.  That virus message I got to listen to really came back.  I thought she would at least get it to the parking lot.  Ok then... so I load up and head home.  Now for a list of why I wrote this. 1. No information on the retail side being closed.  Online only so no way to check the items before purchasing.  (With all the Corona virus stuff, I give this a soft pass.)2. Phone system messed up.  Come on this can be checked.3. To make a purchase you have to create an account with no way to opt out of receiving offers. What happened to I give money you give thing.4. I give you money and then I have to wait an hour to receive my purchase?  What is the point of a conformation code?5. Attitude of the boss.  Look, I know that this is a messy situation.  I did my best to be understanding, you have to follow the rules.  But I did what was asked and didn't deserve this kind of service.  I have never had this much lip while trying go give someone money.6. The web ad lies.  In the description it was listed as coming with a power broom and soap blaster. It didn't.   This is what I had questions about.  In all the confusion I didn't check.  This is why I wanted to see it before purchase.  Oh well. Lesson learned.  Dont trust the pawn america website. Two stars for the counter person and the phone rep.  They did ther best, and I am grateful for their customer service skills."

I found the exact model of what he wanted at Pawn America and it came with the extra component that would have cost an extra $60 to buy.  The whole bundle was very affordable and we were so excited to be able to buy it for his birthday. When it came out was in wonderful condition but it did not include the power cable to actual be able to plug it in to power it on. So my son couldn't play with the birthday present he had been excited for months about.  I was very upset and I called the actual pawn shop it came from and the young lady that answered and addressed my issue was so sweet, there was no way I could of took my frustrations out on her. She explained that they did not have the size power cord needed for my sons gift but that she would explain the entire situation to the district manager and have him call me the next day to discuss what could be done. While I waited for the manager to call, we found a power cord from a printer that worked temporarily and my sister ordered the needed replacement cord from Amazon. So all in all everything turned out OK. I could have showed my butt about the issue with the district manager but I didn't want the young lady from the pawn shop to even remotely get in trouble because of how very kind she was. I would order from Pawn America in the future I'll just be more careful and call to make sure everything needed will be shipped."

I did receive an email from a customer service agent and a phone call from someone who I am assuming to be of some kind of importance in the company, I did not ask him specifically his title.  He apologized for my experience and they made things right by offering me the original item free of charge, which quite honestly is very surprising.  The only reason why I can't give more stars was because my original experience was so poorly handled that it really kind of upset me."

I was refunded and given a discount on the next purchase, for the inconvenience.  #2. I purchased ANOTHER watch and was told again that the item was not there... It was \"lost\". Again, I was refunded.#3 I found yet another watch.. I made the purchase and to my surprise it was a success! Praise the lord they ACTUALLY had the item in their possession.  It was delivered Saturday and it looks ok. There is a scratch on the screen that wasn't in the description. Dont get me wrong the customer service was very good. Now having the item you're looking for in stock?? I dont know..you may want to call or email to make sure before you purchase.  Hope this review helped!"

Those are all the reasons people shop at PA, kiss your sales bye bye.  Then I spoke with Brad weeks ago about phoney pricing, so I go to Burnsville to buy a 18k horsebit bracelet that was $1799, but the website said $22something with 20 percent off making it $1619, wrong, 20 percent off of $1799 is $1419, but to make things worse I was told it was sent out to scrap!! So then I was told they thought they could get it back but I would have to pay $1619 because they paid $1400 for it and they have to make money, HEY not my problem the pawn broker paid to much, bottom line 20 percent off of $1799 is $1419, RIGHT BRAD\ud83d\ude00 you said let you know if this pricing thing became an issue, so now it is an issue!"

          "Contenu": "So I have a mixed review, we have done business with them for years. We ordered a ring online from Duluth and it was damaged and the return process was great. The people ( online department and Duluth stores)were friendly and wonderful, Most of the stores are great.Yet your fridley store however is a mixed bag. One of the managers put that anything I buy from them is final sale. I have had returns in the past due to items not working out or not being what I thought. That's the problem with buying used you never know what your gonna get. I have a ring on layaway. That I won't be able to finish paying off and according to them I can't get my money back. I can't even get store credit.I get done telling me I could purchase it and then pawn it/ return. (Mind the fact that I needed to cancel because we don't have money to purchase) then Pawn America will make more money off of me.So they're making over $400 OFF ME either way.. I haven't even technically purchased the item. I understand small restock fee but $400 plus dollars is theft! I can't finish the layaway because I had to buy a new car so I can get to work so all the money had to go to that instead. I feel like this manager has a personal vendetta against me. They make me feel like dirt. They left me on hold for over 11 min.Considering all the money we have spent at pawn America over the years , this is made to feel like a cheap shot at us. You may save money compared to a jewelry store or best buy but save your sanity and do business with people who have some  integrity! They make money off of other people's misfortunes. If you are doing business with them go to any store but Fridley! Horrible horrible experience! If I do need anything it won't be from fridley.Update: They did return my money today, I appreciate that. So this issue was resolved. I do not however appreciate getting a lecture about return policies etc. While I will continue to do business with Pawn America I plan to avoid this store. Thank you for finding a resolution to this matter."

Clarifying that would help avoid time looking for additional items to get over threshold. Also, item (as advertised) had some gooey residue on it. It would have taken limited time for you to use some goo be gone on it and made the item more attractive. I can understand the desire not to mar the item but even just using a damp cloth could have probably done it rather than leaving it for the consumer to do themselves. Again it was as advertised so no complain there, just a suggestion.Item was received timely and was packaged appropriately. Would definitely look for similar such items in the future. Great price was definitely a factor in making this purchase!"

The online system says they only take orders from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday, which seems weird for an online system.On a whim, I tried it again the following Monday and was able to order the same item with no problems. Glad I was persistent. This was a very unusual item and considered as new in the box (Tactacam video camera for gun or bow). They did a nice job of packaging it and didn't charge excess postage (only about $8)."

I really appreciate her helping me today in cleaning my necklace.Thank you. Another reason I dig it is because of variety. They have some very unique merchandise which makes it cool to just walk around and not to mention they have helped me out with a loan a couple of times. The only knock is sometimes some things are overpriced in my opinion, but then again you will also find some real steals in things being insanely underpriced. So it washes out. Lasty, thanks a lot to everyone who makes coming there as cool of an experience as it is."

          "Contenu": "After searching online for an Xbox Series S, I came across one from Pawn America that was a good deal. I then called to make sure the details about the item were correct. The call rep I spoke with was pleasant and answered all my questions. He even ensured me that if I had any problems upon receiving the item, to give them a call back and they would take care of it. After making the purchase online, I received a confirmation email that included a tracking number. The item was shipped same day and arrived to me in the exact time frame it was scheduled to be delivered. It came packaged very well with the Xbox in it's original box, packed inside of a larger brown shipping box. The item was just as described and I am very happy with my purchase. I will definitely be doing business with Pawn America in the future after they showed that they do things decently and in order."
