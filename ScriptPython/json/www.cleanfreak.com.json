Last order was a defective floor machine.  Ask them to send me a new one and I will send defective back to them.  They said no.  They want me to ship back to them and would contact me for shipping instructions.  Still have not heard back from them.  Frustrating process.  I will probably spend my dollars elsewhere and look for a company that wants to solve problems for their customers.  Not create new ones."

Wait days to ship the product back as the people who were supposed to send me the BOL and shipping info were out \"sick\", wait another almost 2 weeks for a replacement to arrive at Clean Freak, and now I am going to have to coordinate another dro[p off with the shipping company. All for something that wasn't even our issue.  So, overall, it has taken nearly 2 months since the day I ordered my product and as of today, I still do not have it.  They gave me a 15% discount that wasn't even offered to me, I had to ask for it, wait, while approval from a manager took place. Meanwhile, the job we needed this for has already happened, I had to rent a machine, and I still don't have the one I ordered. And there were so many questions, so many steps, so many approvals, so many things I had to do myself. Like truly?  It was broken when you delivered it, give me a new one asap, and you deal with all the minute details....bottom line, period."

          "Contenu": "I ordered a $3600 floor scrubber online which was a big risk and my fault for making that decision.  I assumed, since this product was being ordered online, that there had to be some sort of reasonable return policy as I could not see it in person or try it out.  Unfortunately, the instant I opened the box I realized I needed the battery powered version instead of the plug version.  I contacted Cleanfreaks.com and they were helpful but informed me that not only would I have to pay to ship it back, I would be charged a 20% restocking fee.  This information is on their website so I admit that they didn't really do anything shady.  That being said,  I also discovered it would cost me $500-600 to ship it back.  Just to be clear, I never used the product or took it out of the box.  I found myself standing over the box, staring at this floor scrubber that I knew was not what I wanted.  Nevertheless I had just paid $1300 to discover this.I guess I would just say the only person who should be ordering a floor scrubber or any other cleaning machine through cleanfreaks.com is someone who has already used the product and knows exactly what they want.  But make sure you don't screw up the order or you'll be out about $1300 before you even open the box and discover the mistake you've made.  Why wouldn't you go to a local cleaning supply store and ask them to order it for you?  They might still charge you a restocking fee if you end up not liking it.   But they might have a rental you could try out at home before you take the dive on such an expensive product.  They also might have a used version you could try (presumably someone who sold them back the product they didn't want at the cost of a restocking fee).   At the very least you'll save yourself $500 in shipping even if you have to pay a restocking fee.  By the way, I have since checked with a few local stores and the price they are quoting me is about what Cleanfreaks.com sold it to me for minus the $500 shipping fee.  Don't expect to get a better deal online for this.  It just doesn't make sense to buy a product like this from Cleanfreaks.com or or any other online vendor for that matter."

I found one on Amazon and ordered it and received it the next day, so I cancelled the back order. Every time I called and spoke with Matt on the issues with my order he was very rude and not friendly. Matt did not know much about the products we purchased. It would have been nice to get an update on my back order item, I had to call each time to get an update and was spoke to very rudely each time."

The sprayer tip had to be removed on day1 and readjusted...still not quite right but better than how the factory sent it out. The latch to secure the tanks together is just a poor pitiful design. The stainless tool is very bulky & uncomfortable to use compared to my previous Mytee Lite extractor. The suction/cleaning power just isn't adequate for me. So, in the past week I have called, left messages & sent an email attempting to return this item. NO RESPONSES BACK.....i cant fathom why a company of this size is operated so poorly. Customer service goes a long way & unfortunately this has been bad on both ends...Product&Service. The ONLY good thing about this whole experience, is the sweet young lady who helped me place my order via phone...she was very polite & accommodating. Order#: 500049498"

Speaking with customer service rep Matt (who was very polite), I found that our order would not ship until around 10/7/2018 (more than a month after order/payment) - because the manufacturer, Viper, was building the extractor AFTER order/payment and was waiting on parts. Our order will drop directly from Viper in Michigan once our unit has been built. I kindly let Matt know that better customer service would involve communicating with us (rather than me having to call him) to let us know that the promised terms of delivery weren't even remotely accurate. He apologized. But ... I've been in management ... and I know the problem is not Matt's but CleanFreak's. This ain't customer service folks. Sitting on our money for over a month with no communications and no order delivery. Very disappointed."

I inquired and then was told it would ship the week of 10/11, but rest assured I would get tracking numbers for my my item, which shipped in three separate boxes due to its size and weight. Out of the blue, I received a box. It was one of the three, but only one. I never received any emails or contact letting me know my order had shipped. I asked again, could they provide the tracking numbers for me? And they sent me the tracking number of the items I had already gotten. I can\u2019t imagine this is difficult, (because it\u2019s not) just to send along information once you know something is on a way to a customer who had just spent almost $1,000 in your site.. but it was. I sent a strongly worded email and suddenly I was provided with the other two tracking numbers. I\u2019m still waiting for my items. I will never order from Clean Freak again.

I was reassured that they come together and not to worry. When I received my package it was just the pad driver as the shipping details showed. I called customer service a second time and spoke to a different rep who looked into it. I was told I would be called back once they figure it out and that in the future I should call before placing an order to make sure nothing is back ordered. An hour after speaking to the rep I receive an email with shipping details for the auto scrubber with no estimated shipping date. I had to wait for the shipping company to call and schedule the delivery to figure out when I would receive my order. Also, orders can be shipped between 5-12 business days. Meaning it can take 3 weeks to ship and then another week to receive your package. Moral of the story? Call before you place an order every time!"

The one I found said what to do but what good was that when I didn't know the terms of each part. I just did a quick youtube video on one that was similar, and it was easy after that.I will say it's a little hard to kick up the front squeegee part but it's no big deal. It was very easy to empty.

          "Contenu": "I ordered 3 times from CleanFreak.com for my carpet cleaning business.My first order was placed with items missing when I checked out which would've resulted in me paying extra shipping. Jessica was very helpful and was able to quickly process my refund so I could submit the correct order.My second order was placed correctly, however the vendor was VERY delayed on the manufacture of their machines. This lead to communication issues between the manufacturer and CleanFreak which made it difficult to communicate to me the ETA of the delivery. I ended up having to cancel my order 8 weeks later so I could place an order for an in stock machine.This lead to issues in processing the refund for the items that were not shipped. The refund was processed quickly but incorrectly. Despite this, a quick email to explain I was missing part of the refund, and the remainder was refunded to me.The third order was for a buffer only to hopefully accomplish what the previous two orders should have. I can not say enough how awesome this order went. I ordered the buffer for a good price, paid a little higher on shipping than I wanted, however the shipping was VERY fast and the machine was delivered best freight the next week (roughly 4 business days). Despite the intial trouble, I am so pleased with the final order as I heard this is how its supposed to go from other CleanFreak customers. I am very happy with the service and assistance throughout the entire process, and will order from CleanFreak again when I need to restock my supplies.Big thanks to Jessica and Kathryn for their patience, responsiveness, and excellent assistance through the process."

When you fill the external tank full of cleaning solution. Changing the buffer pad out is a 2 person job. There is no lid on the tank, therefore, when you lay it down to change the buffer pad. YOU will make a mess. Other than that issue, it's a 5-star product."

          "Contenu": "I was recommended an item from CleanFreak for our commercial bathrooms and ended up purchasing a few different items. The items seem to be working and smell great but there seems to be an issue internally. I originally never received a confirmation order and placed an order on July 29th. I called on August 18th to check on my order since nothing had been shipped or confirmed. I called to check in and they had my order in process and realized half of the order was shipping direct from the manufacturer and some things were out of stock. I finally received half my order about a week after speaking to someone in customer service on the 18th and then finally received the rest of the order on September 2nd. I know this is sort of out of the company's control but I was in limbo for a while without any information. At this time I will continue to purchase products from CleanFreak because they seem like they are working well for what we need."
