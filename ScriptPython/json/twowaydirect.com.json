New OEM batteries are on their way from Small World.   Still no response at all from Two Way Direct !!! Be warned."

The customer service was poor and would never buy from two way direct especially with the lack of follow up and/or trying to help resolve my issue. Even a simple apology with a discounted mic thats compatible wouldve made me happy."

I called again the following tuesday, and spoke to another CSR who told me he would look into the matter, contact Beau, and they would get back to me either than day, or the next morning. It is now friday, and still no response from the company. I called and spoke to a very nice CSR who tried to be helpful, but was unable to connect with Beau or the other CSR i spoke with. I ended up canceling the order and ordering the radios from another customer. Very unhappy with the customer service and the lack of communication. We will not be using this company for any further business."

They can\u2019t keep doing their customers like this.  Worst place ever.  They don\u2019t train the sales reps before they let them tell customers incorrect information which causes the customers to try and fix the issues.   The managers don\u2019t respond to emails, their customers service is terrible (non existent).  Save yourself the headache and run \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2640\ufe0f from this place. I wish I could, but in 28 months when my contract is over I\u2019M GONE.  We changed banks and I asked Liam the sales rep how do I update my method of payments. He sent me a form and told me to return it.  I competed it and returned it, then my bank had to replace my card so I resent the form letting them know the card number was the same just a different expiration date and 3 digit code.   When I started getting emails saying we were behind and our service was going to turned off, I contacted Liam to find out the form he sent me was for the initial payment for the radios.  That we had to contact Motorola to change our payment method.   I asked him why he sent me the form when I told him I needed to change the payment information, he sent me an email that said sorry I was new.  So that\u2019s the customer problem that he was new and didn\u2019t know what he is doing.  Well it has turned into my problem because I\u2019m still trying to get Motorola to update my account (no luck yet).  We had to replace 1 battery within 2  weeks of having the radio, oh they would have possibly replaced it but I would had to ship the radio back for them to look at it then (at our expense) than pay for return shipping again at our expense for them to tell us if it\u2019s the radio or battery. Well we just replaced the battery with a Motorola battery.  We had to end up shipping the radio back after a month of receiving it for warranty work (at our expense) since the radio would come on but wasn\u2019t able to use it. They received it May 3rd per my tracking number, but having heard a word that they have even received it. So we are paying for a radio that we can\u2019t use and who knows when we will get it back, our sales rep Liam doesn\u2019t communicate very well. I\u2019m sure I will know it\u2019s been fixed or replaced once I\u2019m hit with shipping cost.  It\u2019s like let\u2019s get that sale then the heck with the customers. This whole experience has been a nightmare.  Again, run from this company."

          "Contenu": "I ordered an earpiece for a specific radio and I went with Two Way Direct because they were about half the price as other websites and their website indicated it was in stock - no indication the item I had purchased was back ordered. Shortly after I placed the order, an account manager reached out to me to see if she could learn more about my business and communication needs. A couple of days (2) later, I went on the Two Way website to check the status of my order. It's kind of a pet peeve of mine if you take my money and don't ship the item I ordered...I guess I'm weird like that. Fortunately, I referred back to the email sent by the account manager asking when it would ship.  In an early morning email, the manager advised they would check on it and get back with me \"shortly.\"  Granted the word \"shortly\" could hold different meanings for different people, but I was thinking shortly was SAME DAY.  Shortly was apparently two days.  Long story short, the product I ordered on 09/03 will (allegedly) be shipped on 09/20.  I think most people would appreciate knowing if an item - no matter how expensive or not - is in stock or on back order and then the BUYER makes the decision if they want to continue with the purchase.  I think a fair gesture to make things right would be to ship the item I purchased via expedited shipping - but I'm not going to hold my breath on that."

I called to get a status and was told I would get a callback as soon as possible. That was Friday. I still have not heard back from them. They have been good about getting back. I just bought the earpiece and it works pretty good. Somehow the earbud fell out and I cannot just stick the tube in my ear. I have a backup which I am using but I would like to use the one I bought. Don't know what the hang up is. I realized last Monday was a holiday but 5 days and it still has not been shipped! Not good customer service."

At this point we decided to go with an easier option and got everything returned, except for this $45 cable. They actually refuse to take it back because it isn't defective. As another small business I can't help but feel this is the wrong move to make, daily we make decisions in the customers favor just to make sure we're meeting every need. In this case our needs weren't even attempted to be met, a simple \"Nope, sorry\" was all we got. Funnily enough, we spent $50 on the new device that came with all the cables and disks it needed. I'd recommend using another service, the only reason they aren't getting one star is because they called soon after the order was placed to make sure we were in touch. Great communication, abysmal customer service."

          "Contenu": "I recently made an on-line purchase from this company and was impressed with the quick follow-up both via email and phone by one of the sales agents eager to assist with this or future purchases. When the product arrived I realized immediately that I had ordered the wrong item and it would not work with my device. I called the sales rep who, while willing to pursue it, informed me that web purchases were not returnable. The rep did help identify the correct product and indicated he would ask the manager to allow a return of the unopened product I received. Unfortunately the manager held fast to the no-return policy. In today\u2019s on-line shopping environment providing an outstanding customer experience is critical. Winning new and retaining existing customers can make the difference between growing or perishing. I\u2019m disappointed that this company seems to miss that point. While one can call a helpful sales rep at this company to place an order, in my mind that kind of negates the convenience of online shopping."

          "Titre": "Impressive customer follow-up, but undisclosed out of stock caused delays",
          "Contenu": "UPDATED REVIEW: Initially having given the company 5 starts, I now have to rate them as 3. I waited 9 days for my order before calling them to find out that they don't have the item in stock and may be another week before they receive their shipment, then they can ship to me. There was no notice on their site when ordering that these were not in stock, which is unfortunate, given I have a particular date I needed to use these at  camp. If you want to place an order with Two Way Direct, I would suggest you call and ask about stock before placing the order online. TrustPilot reviews can be helpful, but Two Way Direct offered me a discount for posting a review, which is fine, but readers should know that the reviews of Two Way Direct on TrustPilot may largely reflect customers that have just ordered and not yet actually received their product. Service experience was certainly 5 starts at the time of purchase, it just didn't hold up through the fulfillment process.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I didn't finish my order and left items in the cart. They sent me an email and asked if I had any questions or needed assistance. Normally I would find that creepy tracking, but in this case I took it as a sign of good customer service \u2014 as they offered an 800 number to call for help as well. Seems like a well run business with the best price online for the product I ordered. Looking forward to seeing how fast their fulfillment is, now that they have the completed order."

However I had no idea my item had shipped until I called customer support, spoke to the very helpful Bo and was sent the invoice. This information was nowhere else to be found. Instead I found this site and saw all the reviews about items not being in stock and ended up spending more money to get the items from a different vendor in hopes I had them in time for the event. I understand that a good chunk of your business comes from large orders who are used to the invoice process. However your process is not friendly to individual consumers who are expecting to get their shipping information without having to call."

A week or so later I get an email saying the replacement charger has been mailed and they gave me the tracking number. I have read some of the reviews for this company and I'm a little shocked on some of the comments concerning back orders, shipping, no contact with sales and so on. I'd just like to say that this transaction went as smooth as it could only because I stayed in touch with them and reported any faults that involved my purchases. I have nothing but the best comments for the people I dealt with and will continue to buy. Thank you all for your hard work and a special thank you to Vanessa."

Her product knowledge is vast, her communication skills are top-notch, and her customer service is truly unparalleled.

They're reliable, robust, and have significantly improved our team's communication. Vanessa made sure we chose the right models for our specific needs, and she took the time to walk us through the features and functionality of each device.What struck me most about Two Way Direct was their commitment to their customers. Vanessa and her team made us feel valued and appreciated, and they worked tirelessly to ensure we were satisfied with our purchase. Their after-sales service has been equally impressive, with Vanessa always ready to assist with any queries or concerns we may have.In a world where good service is hard to come by, Vanessa and the team at Two Way Direct stand as a shining example of what a customer-centric business should look like.
