Chapter 2 - The replacement part (cue sinister sounding organ music)I ordered a replacement Ice Maker (PS1993870) for my GE fridge.  The part was one of those 'compatible' replacement kits which always inspires fear and trepidation to those who have experience replacing things.  Unfortunately this was another one of those cases.  The kit included a plethora of parts to help match a number of different models of existing ice makers and you have to decide what combination works on your fridge.  Depending on the model you're replacing I suspect this will be fairly trivial task. Mine however, was a little more complex due to the design change which required me to research how ice makers actually work (youtube as always is invaluable for this).  With this newfound wisdom, I'm happy to report the replacement part does indeed work for my fridge and now beautifully formed ice is magically appearing again within the confines of my freezer.  Equally important, the maker now knows when the ice bin is full and to call it a day."

I replaced the old part with the new one and it didn\u2019t seem to work. I read the return policy and I decided to bite the bullet and take my losses. I submitted a review based on what I thought was unfair with the return policy. A few days later I got a reply from the Director of sales and he informed me that everything would be taken care of if I wish to continue with the return. I took him up on it and I can\u2019t say enough about the support I received from the people that worked there. I am very grateful and pleased with the outcome. First class operation."

Today, August 5th, 2013, I finally had time to replace the part. I opened the box and found the coils were broken and in pieces in the box. I understand this is most likely the shipping provider but the part wasn\u2019t wrapped in bubble wrap and just laying in the box. Now I have to pay for another part. Idk if I would order from here again unless they send me another part at no cost, wrapped how it should be.8/22/23I would like to add on to my review. My original review was a 1star and I was mad in the moment. I did not expect for this company to do what they did and send me a new one. Stand up company. I apologize for the original review."
