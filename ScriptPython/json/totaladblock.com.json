Web site, support, horror.The website is a maze with no exit, and customer service is an echo chamber. Prepare for zero assistance and an onslaught of spam. The product shines, but the neglect is simply shameful.And to Daniel who is behind \"noreply\" at totaladblock.com, who's so keen on filling my inbox with futile reminders to renew\u2014congratulations, you've been promoted to my mail-rule \"Adblock\": straight to the bin. Keep the offers coming; they make excellent digital confetti."

Subscription never showed up on my Apple Card so I could not cancel it following all  directions on their site on how to do so. Somehow Total Adblock was able to charge the account (debit card/checking) with which I pay my Apple Card. Clicked on chat box on their site and it kicked me back to overall menu for the site. Basically they make it impossible to cancel the account (I saw that this happened to another reviewer). I had to have my bank stop and block further charges. On top of it all the app was ineffective in blocking ads - they still popped up - it only blocked me from getting to the advertiser if I clicked on the pop-up."

I tried those options many times and they conveniently don't work, strange that. Don't try to suggest it's easy to cancel when you have deliberately made sure it isn't.

And just to rub it in I get another billing mail telling me my account is suspended due to non payment \ud83e\udd2c yes, correct, & it will never be paid because I used PayPal & cancelled the authorisation with them. So TotalBrainblock take the hint yeah!UPDATE 3: Now, as expected they ignore all mails despite receiving them. As myself & many others have pointed out these thieves will not cancel your subscription but lie to try to get your payment set up again. Have reported them to the authorities for attempted theft & fraud"

This is a complete racket, and it should be illegal. I notice that all of the positive reviews are invited ones. That's suspicious.UPDATE: Total Adblock has refunded our money. I used the billing address on my original confirming email. However, I still would not recommend this company due to their shady billing practices and dead contact links."

Then I was unable to download and install Total Ad Block. I contacted customer service (chat was the only option) and the agent confirmed I had not installed any of the 3 programs. I asked to cancel and be refunded. In fact I asked at least a dozen times. The agent would only send me a link for downloading help. By this point I no longer wanted the software because my experience on their website totally killed any confidence I might have had, at every step, they tried to upsell me without taking me directly to what I had requested, and clicking on Install or Download never worked, the help button just took me back to the same useless \"dashboard.\" CS agent ended the chat when I kept asking for cancellation and a refund. This was less than 24 hours after the original purchase. I had given up on it last night and started over tonight when I got an email saying I hadn't finished setting up my account (which hadn't worked properly last night). Totally buggy website, why would I trust their software now?"

Not a lot of use if you didn't set it up.Logged onto the web site and it was trying to sell the product to me. Why if I already have an account!?So back to customer services whose next helpful response was they had sent a link to my account that would allow me to log in - but you had to log in to view it\u00a1!!!I finally got the account cancelled and one month payment refunded because that is what I had agreed to - and that is the whole point I didn't sign upGetting nowhere fast so picked up the phone and rang customer services and got a young lady who seemed totally unconcerned about my complaint. through out the call she talked at ten to the dozen not taking time to listen to me and when I tried to talk shouted me downSo I have stopped the payments and got last month's refunded but no right of appeal for the four previous months.

These emails were ignored and I forgot about the whole thing, until I was charged again the following month. After days of trying to find the option to cancel, I discovered that there is no option to cancel on the website and when you stop auto-renewal, they inundate you with discounts and more offers to rejoin. Offers that are so pathetic and low, it just proves how worthless the service is.Eventually I managed to find their primitive live chat service, which puts you in touch with a person with a fake name that speaks broken English and spends half the time trying to offer you more ad-ons and discounts instead of acknowledging that all you want is a cancellation and a refund. In the end, the person stated I was ineligible for a refund on the first month because I didn\u2019t cancel in time. So, they ignored my cancellation email on the day I bought the service and claimed that I didn\u2019t cancel in time, despite me providing evidence for everything I said? What a joke.This is the only review you need to read. I need to find a way to report this company and shut them down because this is plainly criminal."

I spent another hour trying to get  help with a refund and cancellation -- still to no avail.   I am beyond frustrated because they have stolen $353 and I cannot find a remedy.  SECOND UPDATE:  I filed a second dispute on PayPal.  (There were two separate transactions.  PayPal reviewed my first case and decided it was an authorized transaction.)  In the second dispute I was able to include Total AdBlock's  response to the review I placed on TrustPilot.  Total AdBlock's response stated that they send an e-mail to customers 30 days in advance of the renewal date.  I advised PayPal that I did not receive advance notice for either transaction.  This time PayPal deemed both transactions as \"unauthorized\" and Total AdBlock notified me that they were refunding my money.  I was also able to get a real person to cancel my subscription by replying to SUPPORT (at sign) TOTALADBLOCK.COM.   I have since subscribed to PROTON.COM for VPN and adblocking services.  Their price is about $60 per year.  I'm hoping for a better experience from them."

Their sign up page does't make this at all clear as it is buried in tiny grey print. Fortunately I spotted it before I signed up.  Will look for alternatives from other companies who are more honest about their costs.  I fully expect them to challenge this review and/or just keep adding the fake 5 star reviews on top."

In chat I am asked full name, address, phone number..things I was not asked when I purchased this adblock. I provided the customer number and if it is not enough, this is it. I had good intentions and tried to inform you that my card is closed and therefore you will not be able to charge it anymore. You should have in place an easy system to cancel the renewal.The program works well but obviously now I am suspicious and will not use it anymore even it is paid for one year. I think you should better organize the billing process.BrElenaThank you for quick reply here, I could not find the account closure but I wrote an email to the address mentioned in your webpage for cancellation.I added one star, the program is efficient to block adds. Hopefully the billing issues will be fixed.Best regards,Elena"

However, the service was incredibly limited IMO unless I used it on my desktop computer.My main concern is the hard sale techniques they used when I tried to cancel the auto-renewal. There was no option to manage my subscription. It took four emails to their replies that encouraged me to continue using the service before finally being sent a link to cancel. Additionally, I had agreed to pay \u00a335 for the year. However, the following text was buried in the notification stating renewal is \u00a3119 for the year.\u201cAs a reminder, your Total Adblock annual service is set to renew on 19th of January for \u00a3119.00 unless cancelled. If you would like to keep your service active, no further action is required.\u201dTotal Adblock has since confirmed this information is readily available on their website.Of course the final email from them began to offer a reduced rate of \u00a335 to keep my business. I felt that accepting this offer would lead to the whole auto renewal saga next year, so I declined by cancelling. Personally, I would never subscribe to this service again! I\u2019d rather die in the sand!"

When I reestablished my ID it would not accept my pasted name and address. What a pain! Had to type the whole thing by hand. More wasted time.4. When  I tried to paste my 16 digit credit card number it would not accept pasting. Another waste of my time.Most web sites allow pasting of the card no but require only manually entered expiration dates and the CVV. What a waste of time to copy the 16 numbers manually to your web site from a file on my machine or to try to read them from the new type of card with the nearly illegible numbers! Made me so mad I almost cancelled the renewalEach one of those 4 time-wasting impediments to a quick renewal should have cost you one star each, but I was generous and gave you two stars.My renewal of Adblocker was such a wretched experience that I would not have tolerated if Adblocker were not so good and reliable."

In addition, it is alarming that only after purchasing the product and during the install process did I realise how insecure it is. It made me feel very uncomfortable proceeding, but I already purchased the product. If you cannot help me get rid of all the ads mentioned above, I would like to uninstall the app, including a refund and guidance and support on how to undo the unsecured process I went through."

So on the whole it does block out adverts. My three star rating is because it does not block out adverts 100% and for their staff reading from a script for customer queries, which tells me they know nothing about their product."

I just bought a new computer added Adblocker and realized I still had the Unlimited and never did get a refund. Contacted customer service. No help at all. Only offered to remove what I don't use no refund, no offer of a different service that I might use like VPN nope nothing. On me as life happened and I did not notice I was not refunded, yep but contacting customer service and no help. That's on them.Edit to add:They refunded my $39 back, so I upgraded to 3 stars. It still should not have to be the only way you get help from them is to leave a bad review. Again the product is amazing and I have never had a problem with it but you really need to look at how much power you give to your customer service agents to help your customers."

I installed TOTALAdblock during a session where I had the browser window with the video I wanted to share (that had an inappropriate ad at the top of the ad column) and before sharing I installed it, when I clicked back over to the browser window with where the ad had been, it was gone!  It worked immediately without even having to reload or restart my computer.  It was amazing to me to have something that actually worked within seconds!  It has proven to be reliable, something that is paramount as a remote tutor/teacher!"
