          "Contenu": "I ordered a Coilcraft's M302 kit of \"unicoil\" 7/10 mm tunable RF inductors for the purpose of being able to determine the best valued inductor while prototyping for a medium volume application. The kit contains a large number of inductors and the inductors work well, but the kit arrived with the inductors scattered in the case, and the case could be better arranged to allow easily finding the inductor you want to test. Coilcraft competes with Wurth in this space, and although I prefer Coilcraft's inductors, Wurth's packaging is more user friendly.After hearing about this, Coilcraft contacted me and quickly resolved the issue."
