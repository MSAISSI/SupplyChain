Unfortunately, my website recently fell victim to an unjustified suspension by HostPapa.To make matters worse, this isn't the first time my site has been suspended by Simon Bernave from HostPapa. Strangely enough, these suspensions seem to coincide with my inquiries about upgrading my website.My advice? Save your money and steer clear of HostPapa. Their initial attractive pricing may lure you in, but be warned\u2014they'll pull the rug out from under you. After investing time and money in developing your website, they'll start suspending it and demand additional payments.Learn from my experience, and stay away from the headache. There are better options out there. Share your thoughts and experiences, and let's help each other make informed decisions!#HostPapaExperience #WebsiteHosting #CustomerBeware #ShareYourExperience"

In 2023, I decided to host my web application with HostPapa again, but this time I had a bad experience with HostPapa. Here are the reasons for this bad experience. 1. some of your senior technicians update the tickets without reading/understanding the customer's request 2. Response time is more than 5 hours 3.   A simple request takes more than 10 days without a solution being provided.4. Some senior Hostpapa technicians are not honest, they cannot tell a customer whether his request can be processed or not. For more information, you can check the ticket #7178776. 5. Provide updates that are not related to the customer's request.Thank you for your attention."

The practice of selling a service that they guarantee a list of their products can be used on then down the road insisting you must be pay to actually get them to work properly is illegal in Canada under the Competition Act.

The thing is to upgrade it's like 5x more and they'll harass you until you do (I assume so, I didn't upgrade).You'll also discover this ridiculously low \"inode limit\" which isn't stated anywhere! It's crazy how they still have customers.After that, they'll start taking over your websites with a message advertising themselves and until you reply, it'll be down. After a while of them realising that I won't be paying, they shut down your website completely and go to sleep. You won't be able to get it back.On top of that, the staff are extremely rude! In fact, one time, I randomly received an invoice for a domain I didn't even purchase!So that's where I'm at right now. I went to Trustpilot which I regret not doing beforehand and found that a lot of people agree.Whatever you do, DON'T USE HOSTPAPA!!!Edit: Just as you see below, HostPapa\u2019s excuse. I was never told any of this. There\u2019s nothing that big on my hosting anyways. Never use HostPapa!!!"

The cost of the package was pretty similar to another provider I had used before as was the size of the hosting program.  I put up an under construction sign, but then got busy with my other responsibilities and that was the first time that the emails started, threatening that my site was using too much resources.  Now mind you, this was for the starter wordpress theme and an under construction sign.  The emails were made in a way to make you worry and freak out.  I contacted them and told them I had no idea how I was using so much resources, they said if I upgraded the package this wouldn't be an issue.  So I upgraded.  For a website that was one page.  A few months later I started trying to build the site and the threats started again.  They would have to suspend my website.  Mind you, this website was tiny, like five pages, no video, less than 50 small pictures.  But I had to upgrade, again or they would suspend it.  So I moved providers.  When I went to cancel they hijacked my site and I had to basically take an old backup and rebuild my site.  They have cost me time, money and caused so much stress.  I am now paying less at the other provider to host my site and they say I don't need to upgrade because it's a really small site without much content.  Host papa can kick rocks.  I literally would receive daily emails from them telling me I had to spend more money.  They had a guy who would just send me pages long emails several times a day to tell me this.  What a waste of my time, money and stress.  Please avoid these shysters."

          "Titre": "Inadequate response to a complaint related to the hosting fee \u2013 website and account termination with no notice",
          "Contenu": "Simply shocking behaviour after my complaint asking for a refund (reasons summarized below) \u2013 Hostpapa terminated the website as well as my account with them with no notice whatsoever, giving me no time to make new webhosting arrangements! Unbelievable!Utterly appalling and inadequate customer care received from Hostpapa (ticket #8199900), which did not even try to understand my points, ignored my questions and always provided a lengthy and meaningless replies. As the situation was going nowhere, I requested information about Hostpapa regulatory authority to escalate my complaint and mentioned that this issue might be taken to court if they are not willing to make it right. As a result, the website hosting and the account with Hostpapa were terminated with no notice.THE ISSUE: at the end of the first billing cycle there were two emails: first one stated that \u201cHostPapa service is due for renewal just 30 days from now\u201d, the second one said: \u201cTotal due: \u00a3 0.00\u201d, therefore it was my understanding that nothing to be paid at that point. Only 1.5 month later when the bank statements came through there was a transaction with unexpectedly inflated hosting fee, that increased by 3.3 times compared to its original value. I complained to Hostpapa stating that (i) I was not informed about the x3.3 times price increase for their services, (ii) was not informed that it is going to be taken for 3 years in one go (iii) I did not authorize that payment and, very importantly, (iv) received a misleading email with \u201cTotal due: \u00a3 0.00\u201d not even prompting to check the attachment very deep below that actually had a number of \u00a3561.17 to pay.Therefore, I asked Hospapa either (i) to price match their fee to the original payment of \u00a3170.64 or (ii) to terminate the agreement with the refund of unused hosting duration\u2026. Considering the situation (points above), it could have been a fair resolution I believe.In response to that I was offered: (i) website hosting termination with no refund or (ii) 30% discount after x3.3 times price increase. As I was not happy with either option, I asked for the details on their regulating authority and, as a result, my account and the website were deleted\u2026. Shocking, isn\u2019t it? Zero reply, no notice of termination\u2026.. nothing.Definitely not the web hosting provider you want to deal with. It feels like it is their system to deceive you with zeros in \u201ctotal due\u201d and not inform you about the actual amount to be taken (inflated enormously), and when you realize that they response would be \u201cNo refunds\u201d.On top of that they would disrupt your business with the website termination with no advanced notices as a penalty that you dared to complain perhaps.AN UPDATE: Not sure why Hostpapa claims that this feedback is \u201cdeceptive and quite defamatory\u201d if I only describe the received experience.A partial refund came through after the website was terminated, yet \u00a3140 was withheld from \u00a3561.17, and there was no communication, no final statements explaining the calculation, nothing (to me the penalty is unreasonably high). Yes, I asked for the refund and termination of the agreement, but I expected that Hostpapa would tell me the date from which it will take effect and will sent a final bill to support this, allowing me some time to make my arrangements. Instead everything was shut with no notice, so I was not even able to copy our correspondence through their ticketing system.The statement in their response below is simply untrue - \u201caccount was canceled, access was denied, and a refund was sent for the remaining time on your web hosting service. This was fully detailed in our last communication with you via ticket 8199900\u201d  - neither of this has been discussed in \u201cticket 8199900\u201d and I was not informed about it by any other means. No calculations or final bill supplied.Moreover, after all this treatment I received, they consider this review as \u201charmful or illegal\u201d twisting the situation inside out as if I am the one trying to cause them some damage, when it is completely the opposite. I am only trying to warn other potential customers not to fall into the same trap with the hosting fees.They say: \u201cciting the fact that the increase in our service renewal costs was 328% and that this was also a concealed fact, both via ticket and especially publicly, here on our Trustpilot page, is rather deceptive and quite defamatory\u201d, yet how would you call a price increase from \u00a3170.64 to \u00a3561.17? It is 3.28 times price increase. And as I was not informed about it I consider it as hidden."

          "Contenu": "HostPapa bought out my small, local ISP within the last year and since then it has been extremely unpleasant to deal with them - broken PHP / SQL issues, terrible tech support, etc.Recently, the sale rep pestered me almost every day about my SSL certificate expiring, trying to sell me a \"basic\" level one at $50 (or a more expensive one).  Turns out I can actually get one from HostPapa for free.  Annoying.Right now I'm looking at renewing some of my domains - HostPapa is aggressively emailing me to do so.  I strongly suspect it will cost more to do it through HostPapa than via my actual domain registrar.  I look forward to finding out.(This most recent help with an IT issue, solved over the website chat, was fine.  But it was an issue because the UI/UX design of the HostPapa website is consistently terrible, and I couldn't find the information I needed.)Response to HostPapa's reply:You are not web development specialists, but your PHP set-up was different than the ISP you took over and that broke my websites, which was the problem.  One of your staff took it upon themselves to rewrite my code (which didn't help), without saving a back-up of the original file (good thing I had one).The emails regarding my SSL were aggressive.  And when I mentioned that the price was high the response was \"well, that's the price\" - a much better response would have been, \"well, we have basic ones for free.\"  See, that would have been good customer service.Re: my domain - I have a domain coming up for renewal in less than 30 days, so that tells me how good your research skills are.  (The domain was registered via my ISP, that you bought out.)Just terrible, all the way down.Further response:I find it interesting that while I added to my review, you erased and edited yours - in particular the part where you said you researched and were certain that I had no domains coming up for renewal, when that statement on your part was 100% wrong.  So much for transparency and accountability.Also, no comment from you on your tech who altered my code without fixing the problem, and didn't keep a backup of the file so it could be put back.And also no comment from you on your SSL salesperson who, upon reading that I felt your price for SSL certificates was high, failed to mention there was a free option - that would have been good customer service.Yes, updated PHP is better - sadly, I was given no heads up that this was going to happen.  Good customer service would have been noting that my original ISP had an older version in place and apprising me that HostPapa used an updated version and that switching might cause problems, rather than switching me to the updated system without any lead time on my part, so that all my PHP-based websites broke at the same time.  Sure, Patrick tried to help, but I eventually solved the problem myself (his code was wrong) - something I could have had in place -before- my websites all broke simultaneously.Let me ask, which feels more sincere: \"Everything we did was completely justified, and we're going to try and do better!\" or \"Yes, we made some mistakes and we're going to try and do better.\"I know which one I'd choose.I started this review with a 2/5, as a nod to some of the support I received that was helpful.  Your refusal to acknowledge your poor choices (breaking my code and not saving it, not offering me the free SSL off the start, erasing your clearly incorrect statement, and most significantly switching me to a new version of PHP without any warning) have led me to edit it down to 1/5."

          "Contenu": "I'm not happy with this service.I feel betrayed from them.To find your issues you have to look at the reviews not just to justify your behavior to your clients. Eliminate the resources of the issue if you can see it.Ex: If one of your client said i got unlimited hosting and i was expecting unlimited. You can't justify it by saying but we mentioned unlimited as per our policies, go read the policy before you buy it, then in the policy its limited!! Thats false advertisement whivh is agenst consumers right here in Canada. Its only example. So if you have so many similar reviews so you have issue in your ads you have to fix it. Customers trust what they see, trust companies if you want to use our trust agenst us yes you will take from me few 100s from me but you will lose me and all the people that I know and they know because we purposely talk about our case then your will hardly try to fix or reposition your self. So today I requested to replace my account manager.1. One of his emails is ( sorry I did not read your last 2 emails) and i have requested a full refund.2. Other email . Sorry I could not find a question in your email.3. In my previous review HostPapa agreed with me thats more should and most be done  when I mentioned thats no one updated me about my inspection.4. My account manager did not respect me when he blocked all of my websites.5. Insulted me by saying 8n one of his Emails  get a webmaster if you can't find the faults. And I have already informed him that I have a full team of website developers. I'm really glad that we dont need to have face to face meeting because I feel he is unprofessional with me or ungry and im afraid because he has all my information that he can use.Lastly.My previous review about the faults that is never ending case.I had 5 website in the hosting and after I felt hostpapa dont want me and they are pushing me I got a new hosting from DreamHost.I received email from my account manager saying I still have faults in my hosting. So I told him, I have already transferred my websites how I have faults in my account. So obviously HostPapa is using this faults against thier clients to push them out. And sorry I still don't recommend this hosting. My resources usage isCpu, processing,  in/out process and memory is not 60% when I had 5 website and now I have 1 website only with not more than 25 visitors a month, and my account manager is telling me I still have faults. Now is the faults are real? Whos can say its not real nor real?From where the faults are coming?I'm sure Hostpapa can answer and lead us who did this faults after I transferred my big website to different hosting which they did not complain about any fault and I cant see any fault in dreamhost platform. For the sane website I have. I believe full refund will be fair after this behavior with me."

As I didn't want to purchase hosting upgrade, Hostpapa just suspended my Account and took down my website! \u2028\u2028I never understood the \"High Resource Usage\" and what caused it, especially my website had only very few views per month, and my Hostpapa Hosting Business Pro plan included: Unlimited SSD storage for databases and website information, unlimited \"Visits Monthly\", unlimited GB Bandwidth, and unlimited Databases with 2,000 MB per database.\u2028\u2028Hostpapa asked me to find out the root cause of the \"High Resource Usage\", and tried to push me to upgrade my hosting plan! You expect from a Hosting company that they investigate what causes \"High Resource Usage\" and fix it.\u2028\u2028I can't trust Hostpapa, I can't accept that a Hosting company just took down my website although all fees are paid! Hostpapa is not reliable, I can't trust them. No website owner or the audience like to see that their website is suddenly inaccessible, practically doesn't exist anymore.\u2028\u2028I just removed my Wordpress website from Hostpapa and migrated it to another Hosting company, to get peace of mind.\u2028I do not recommend using HostPapa!P.S. Not interested in any contact with Hostpapa, I already moved my website to another Hosting provider!"

I won't post ID's in the text here.The worst mail hoster one can chose for one simple reason... you can't trust them that you receive all important emails.They have an email spam filter that is filtering out mails. At first, two years ago, when I realized that I miss emails that should have reached, I was told that they disabled the filter. A year ago again. Then, a month ago, I found that I missed mails again. Again I spent a lot of time to speak with support. It was the third time overall that I had to do that.They wanted to know details about the email that I miss. When it was sent and from which email address. I could not know it, since it was sent by a service. I gave up on that mail.They told me they can't disable the spam filter, only downgrade it. Sorry, that's not sufficient. I can let thunderbird deal with spam mails, no problem. I need to be sure that I receive all mails. You can't just arbitrarily decide on what a spam mail is because often enough you killed mails that were fine and important.It was so infuriating and time consuming. That's the single most important task of an email hoster. To deliver mails reliable. And they built a undeactivateable function that makes this impossible. Unbelievable.I'm now with Ionos for the same price. They have a spam filter but you can disable it yourself. And I see real spam mails incoming. So I can be sure that I won't miss important mails anymore as well."

Then what should be the flip of a switch becomes a week of back and forth. Also, every email from them has a paragraph about how great they are, even when they are doing an obviously poor job. This makes me think it's a training issue where they are given form letters and rote ways of handling service inquiries. Customers can do much better for the same money at other host companies."

The cost to our business has been huge so far and I see no signs of it improving any time soon.  Even my account manager who promised to personally monitor the process has been silent.  I am so frustrated with them, I am definitely moving to another hosting company, I'm done with them."

I have now dealt with two managers and the \u2018Head of Sales\u2019 and someone from billing and numerous support people. I am within the terms of Host papa in requesting a full refund, as it is within 30 days. This lack of response is what resulted in me disputing the charge on my card in the first place. Please Host Papa if you wish to be seen as a professional company, honour your own terms and respond quickly to customers. Customers are presumably what keeps Host Papa in business, it is a shame that customer retention does not appear to be high on Host Papa\u2019s agenda."

          "Contenu": "I purchased in April 2021 a Hostpapa Hosting Business Pro plan for 3 years for a Wordpress website (is not a Hostpapa website). Although I paid for 3 years and my Hosting plan is still active for almost 2 additional years, I cancelled recently my hosting plans and migrated my websites to another Hosting company, just to get rid of this unserious Hosting company a it's harassment.I have been bombarded with emails and notifications from Hostpapa regarding \"High Resource Usage\", just ~1 year after I started my 3-yers hosting plan, and Hostpapa tried to push me to upgrade my hosting plan for an additional ~$700 yearly! As I didn't want to purchase hosting upgrade, Hostpapa just suspended my Account and took down my website! I never understood the \"High Resource Usage\" and what caused it, especially my website had only very few views per month, and my Hostpapa Hosting Business Pro plan included: Unlimited SSD storage for databases and website information, unlimited \"Visits Monthly\", unlimited GB Bandwidth, and unlimited Databases with 2,000 MB per database.Hostpapa asked me to find out the root cause of the \"High Resource Usage\", and tried to push me to upgrade my hosting plan! You expect from a Hosting company that they investigate what causes \"High Resource Usage\" and fix it.I can't trust Hostpapa, I can't accept that a Hosting company just took down my website although all fees are paid! Hostpapa is not reliable, I can't trust them. No website owner or the audience like to see that their website is suddenly inaccessible, practically doesn't exist anymore.I just removed my Wordpress website from Hostpapa and migrated it to another Hosting company, to get peace of mind.I do not recommend using HostPapa!"

They made some suggestions to optimize my website but never helped me figure out what was actually causing the sudden \"excessive\" usage. I thought that was what support was for? When I wasn't able to remedy the problem, they threatened to suspend my account. The only \"solution\" they provided was upgrading to a higher web hosting plan (which was twice as expensive) which I repeatedly told them I was not willing to do, unless they could explain what was causing the use of the resources and help me solve it. This went back and forth for more than a year with them letting off for a little while and then pestering again without helping me actually pinpoint the problem. They kept sending me \"tutorials to optimize my website\" but I implemented everything as best as I could and they still couldn't tell me why that didn't solve the problem.  I eventually decided to leave when the renewal of my current plan (which was apparently not sufficient) went up almost 100%."

I relaxed, thinking the episode was over.But a few months later, I was handed over to another one whose approach was very different (even though there had been no change to my actual usage since the earlier one).That 'manager' immediately began to bully me with more 'resource usage\u2019 accusations.  I hired a very experienced web developer to review our setup, and he determined that there was nothing at all out of the ordinary going on.  But when I reported that, the new 'account manager' simply ramped up his rhetoric, and began to actually threaten closing my account if I didn\u2019t 'upgrade'.    When I politely and factually disputed his assertions, he simply failed to respond at all.So, to avoid more harassment, I moved my account to another Canadian hosting company - which has worked out very well.Hostpapa did handle all aspects of that transfer very well.In fact, my only complaint is that it seems that someone in the company has mistakenly decided that aggressively trying to 'upsell' existing clients into more lucrative plans is a sensible way to grow the business.  Worse, they appear to have outsourced this 'upselling' to an international network of free-lancers, who have no real stake in the company at all.  In my case, the first one I encountered was polite and helpful - but the next one drove me away from Hostpapa, after 15 positive years."

With this information, I feel the review provided has a good base of reference.My biggest two issues with HostPapa were availability and billing.  When I was Lunarpages, I was consistently at 100% uptime (independently monitored).  With HostPapa, I consistently met their \"guarantee\" of 99.9% uptime.  For those who don't know, 99.9% uptime is 8.77 hrs of downtime each year.  The outages were brief and hardly noticed, but we aren't a customer that needed 99.999% availability.My biggest reason for 2 stars is the billing.  After taking over for Lunarpages, I received a bill for my free domain.  Once I asked about it, a glitch in the system was identified and a credit was issued.  6 months later, HostPapa billed me for domains that they weren't even the registrar for.  I'm not even sure how that works, but again they issued a credit due to a glitch.  I had a domain set to not autorenew as we didn't need it, and guess what, we received a bill for that too.  Once again, a credit was issued.Like other reviews you've read here, the price on renewal went up $300.  The increase was in an email sent sometime after the takeover and prior to renewal.  They offered me a 20% credit, but still made the price crazy-expensive to host starter sites with very little traffic.Did I mention they charged me a month early?  They also renewed my domain at this time without my approval.  I didn't have a chance to cancel my order, or tell them not to renew and they refused to credit back the renewal fee I did not ask for or authorize.  Luckily, my credit card company helped out, but that was the straw that broke the back.  My current provider responds back to tech support questions/issues in hours with helpful answers, and we haven't had any billing issues in the two years since leaving HostPapa."

He told me one of my plugins was causing a conflict, so I disabled it. Simple as that. Six months ago when these problems first started, I specifically asked Hostpapa to tell me if the problem was being caused by a plugin. They wouldn't tell me, and instead tried to get me to pay them more money. I'm still amazed that they invested so much of their own time, and wasted so much of mine, when this issue was so easy to diagnose and fix. Two weeks on, and everything is working fine now, and their constant flow of annoying emails have stopped. So I've added one star to my review.  **Edit: I gave Hostpapa my contact details as requested below. They promptly used them to shut my website down. They haven\u2019t issued a pro rata refund as requested, and they haven\u2019t reached out in any way to deal with my complaint. Genuinely abysmal company.**I left a negative review about Hostpapa six months ago. They did reply, and I hoped that would be the end of the matter. But the thing I complained about is still happening. They contact me constantly to tell me my minuscule Wordpress website, which gets around ten hits per day, is using excessive resources. There are no faults being reported at my end. I have paid someone to health check my site, and they found no problems. Yet Hostpapa insist there is a problem, and that the best way to fix it is to pay them more money. My previous hosts never reported any problems, nor the one before that. And I only use standard plugins. I\u2019ve asked them to stop badgering me, and I\u2019ve invited them to cancel my contract and refund me pro rata if my website is causing them so many issues. But they haven\u2019t done that, and instead just keep driving me mad with their unwelcome emails.(533529)"

In 2018 I decided to use them for hosting my company's website as well. For the first three years I paid just over \u00a3105 (including a year domain registration). Like many others have remarked, the renewal prices are exorbitant! I never checked my renewal bill until it was too late (my bad) but it was more than five times than when I signed up.But what I have encountered this year is way worse and shows the poor service to existing customers. When my renewal came up three weeks ago I checked that my billing info was up-to-date and found the credit card details needed updating (5th October). I raised a ticket and was told that the payment gateway was at fault. For ten days I was told hardly anything and the problem wasn't resolved. Several times the support tried to push me towards the PayPal option (which strangely enough was operational). Then, Hostpapa took it upon them to renew my domain four days before the registration would have expired. I had not granted them the rights to do so, they hadn't asked me and hadn't mentioned the possibility before at any point.I realised that the only way would be to move away from Hostpapa. I cancelled everything by the 18th October and even had the domain transferred by that date (one day before renewal was officially due!). Of course now I have to pay twice for the domain registration. The new registrar has taken my money, quite rightly, and Hostpapa insists to be paid for something I didn't ask them to do."

I looked at the control panel to see if I could adjust backup frequency but it was grayed out so I couldn't change it. It took many many rounds of chats with tech support to figure out what was happening (there was an additional backup system, Acronis, they were using), and that was set to do backups daily. I told them to set backups to every two weeks, and only keep one backup. Fast forward to November and we're still getting \"close to quota, buy more storage\" emails. After MORE chats with support, I come to find out they did NOT make the change I requested, they kept doing the daily backups, and now are keeping backups for two weeks. So they heard the \"two weeks\" but applied that to how long to keep the backups. I can see the login to the Acronis backup area from the control panel, but I'm not able to log in. I ask support to give me the log in, and was told, \"customers aren't allowed to log in to Acronis.\" And they still haven't made the change, which should take just a few seconds to click some buttons. So I don't know if they're just incompetent, or they're intentionally not making the change, hoping that customers will just give up and pay more money for more storage. I'm giving them two stars because I can usually catch someone on tech support chat. But still, if they can't solve my problem in a reasonable time period, it's not much comfort."

The increase is justified by billing specialists as a need due to recent major investment by the company.  Upper-management is of the essence.  Sales likely on commission.  Impossible for it to be a normal way of conducting business.  However, it is. Now, alternating this posting due to final review. I am not removing this review.  No clue why HostPapa flagged my review/comment.  I am a client.  Thank you.HostPapa reply in part:Reviewing your account I am showing that you opted to move away from your legacy \"One Simple Plan\" web hosting service in 2018 under ticket #3649830 due to pricing concerns, at that time we confirmed your account could be switched to our \"Starter\" plan at the promotional rate for that renewal. We also confirmed that the promotional rate for the \"Starter\" plan would only apply on that renewal, that the next renewal would be at our standard rates, this was confirmed as read and accepted by yourself:I the client did not opt out of the:  One Simple Plan Option.  It was no longer offered and the other cheapest option was/is my present plan Starter.Jeneel of HostPapa in 2018 does write that my current hosting is no longer(2018) offered.  I then in 2018 opted for Starter.  Period 2018 to 2021.  Fine. Yes.ticket #3649830Jenell of HostPapa wrote in 2018:2018-11-13 12:41:28\tJenell Underwood\tHello,Thank you for contacting us in regards to our current rates.All clients receive a promotional rate at the time of sign up but the service is then set to renew at the standard rate as outlined in our terms of service. These terms must be accepted when placing a new order with HostPapa.That being said, we are happy to extend the promotional pricing to you once moreas a one time courtesy.Unfortunately we are unable to offer a discounted rate for your current hostingservice as this service is no longer offered. HostPapa recently introduced 3 newlevels of hosting service: Starter, Business and Business Pro.I opted for Starter.Pd. Nov. 2018:  $264.22 credit of 114.91 for a fee of $149.31  3 years plan paid.Pd. Nov. 2021:  $415.42 credit of 83.09 for a fee of $332.73  3 years plan paid.  It is due for renewal in 2024.My payments of 2018 and 2021.Yes, thus resulting in a fee increase of more than 200%.  222% +. What is much of a surprise is that I am the only client surprised by such an increase."

Their support works once you get past their low level \"support\" gang and escalate to their real tech people. They did resolve my immediate issue, but I suspect the basic problem - over-aggressive email abuse control - may still be there.Moving domain servers is a real pain, so choose well from the start. Unfortunately from reviews I'm finding lots of worse, not better, domain hosts at a reasonable price."

I was just told that as the previous invoice was the same, it was correct. What kind of argument is that!?Finally they found the problem, they were charging me for a year, the price of three years. A technical fault I want to believe.Still no one called me and they didn't provide me with a number to communicate with the billing team.Would you contract a company that you cannot talk with the billing department? Even if it is to clarify an invoice? I wouldn't."

I would not recommend, look into other providers for both cost / convenience.One positive is they have refunded the cost of a cancelled service which some providers don't, how ever that is proving drawn out and troublesome as well and i was cancelling because i could resolve some technical issues.Update:  After some discussions I've had a better outcome on the refund. Again i am grateful they do refund contracts where technical issues can't be resolved.Would not recommend go else for more piece of mind should their be issues.I have increased my review to two stars for now.

Their servers aren't too bad either, reasonable load times and very little site downtime.\r But be advised, after the initial sale, you're pretty much on your own, if you have any problems configuring anything, you're likely to struggle for an answer here, so make sure you've got a friendly independent internet consultant on hand.\r Also if you want to add or remove services or just alter your package in any way, this seems near impossible as Host Papa in my experience have been very inflexible when it comes to sorting this kind of stuff out. I think to be fair this often tends to happen with fast growing companies, service and support tend to become secondary to the initial sale.\r One final point, I found the customer service representatives to be quite apathetic and pretty abrupt when it came to dealing with problems, and certainly urgency is never at the top of their list.\r So all in all not a great experience, if they could sort out their customer service issues, I'd have no problem in rating them a 4, but right now it's only just scraping 3 and that's being incredibly fair."

          "Contenu": "We've been with Hostpapa for quite a few years now. We moved there after SmartyHost was taken over by NetRegistry (who are terrible!). Hostpapa is great. Sometimes they irk me, but that is only because of the odd misunderstanding, but they ALWAYS fix it very very quickly. When you chat to them online, it can be a bit annoying that they have to escalate it sometimes, but a) the fact that you can so easily chat so quickly to a HUMAN without having to go through a set of questions first is THE BEST! and b) when they escalate the issue, it is ALWAYS attended to almost immediately...at least, in the same day, but normally within the hour.I only give them a 4 star because I always worry that when you constantly give 5 stars, companies might get lazy and not work as hard to keep their customers happy. Honestly though, at this point, Hostpapa deserve the 5 stars and I hope nothing changes."

          "Contenu": "I requested the migration of two websites and domains from another well-known hosting service based in Austin, Texas. My Hostpapa account was quickly set up, and the migration of my sites and domains went very smoothly. The customer service on HostPapa is top tier. They communicate clearly and thoroughly, they pay close attention to the details of your concerns, and they provide clearly written learning resources so you can implement the various tools and apps associated with your websites. It really does make a difference to deal with a hosting service whose customer service people seem to be based in Canada rather than offshore. It makes communication easier and much more straightforward. Based on my rather mixed experiences with the hosting service I previously used, I'd say HostPapa deserves a 5-star rating. However, having said all of the above, I do have a slight concern about the hosting package and the various add-ons that I signed up for. The sales person who spoke to me did seem to glide over certain details a little too quickly and glibly."

Plus, if you're more hands on, there are a tonne of powerful tools to use, and the support to back you up if you get turned around. The staff are knowledgeable and if they don't know an answer, they go find it."

The other (atkinsongs.co.uk renews later this year)  1. Customer Support from Hostpapa has always been first class in my experience, with account queries dealt with promptly and good technical support when that has been needed. 2. The user interface takes a bit of getting used to (especially MycPanel) but generally I have found it intuitive and responsive to use.3. The pricing is fair from my view point as a customer, so far. My one doubt is that the pricing of the basic Starter site appears to be limited to first time customers which would not include me when it comes to renewal. Depending on the price I am offered, I may be tempted to look for a similar new customer deal elsewhere which I would prefer not to do beause I have been happy with Hostpapa. 4. A suggestion, and perhaps it is there already, but it would be helpful to have some pointers as to how to generate traffic on a website."

Since they finally replied to my inquiry about my site being down (with others experiencing the same problem as it turns out), I am changing my rating to 4/5. Hopefully they can work on providing more efficient customer service and replying to inquiries like they did when I first signed up with them, and not leave me wondering if anyone works there. And when there are future issues, they will address them in a timely fashion.The edited review is below.========I couldn\u2019t see how to change my first review so I\u2019m leaving a new one (NOTE: I have edited the content of this review).My website was down twice - the first time for 2 hours, the second for 13 minutes. I was never notified of any such down time, nor did I ever experience this with my previous hosting provider (I switched from them because they didn\u2019t provide me the customer service I required).When I first signed up (Dec 2019), I was amazed at the excellent customer service I received - I lauded this in my initial review here. In the weeks since however, replies to my inquiries have been much less than prompt, days even.I had opened a ticket, as well as inquiring on HostPapa\u2019s Twitter account... so far, nothing. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get a reply eventually, starting something like \u201cSorry for the delay...\u201d. It also appears that others are having issues as well. What\u2019s going on?"

HostPapa have always responded the fastest, friendliest and with all the necessary information. According to some comparisons, the price was also very good.Even after our purchase, we were never left alone. Every time we had a question or didn't know what to do, HostPapa helped us quickly and competently. A special compliment and thank you goes to Gabriel N. (Customer Happiness Engineer). There may probably be cheaper providers, but for us (especially as beginners) good service is more important than the cheapest price. For us, it was the right decision, a clear recommendation, and we see no reason to change providers in the future."

As an example, I started a live chat on the Sunday of a long weekend. When I explained my question to the support rep, I fully expected that he'd direct me to go open a service ticket. Instead, he opened the ticket for me, sent me the ticket number, and a senior tech had emailed within 15 minutes to let me know that he'd already taken care of my request. It's those details that make HostPapa's customer support stand out."
