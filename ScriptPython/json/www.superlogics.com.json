SuperLogics is by far the worst vendor to deal with when it comes to resolving questions, inquiring existing or past due orders.  SuperLogics is eager to confirm orders and then drop the ball on delivery.  I do not recommend using SuperLogics."

Our software guy, an ex Bell Labs guy, called vendor's service department and Microsoft and neither had a solution.  We discovered this ourselves by accident.  Then, in order to load our software, we were forced to connect to the internet and download 147 updates and install them.  All this made a 6 hour, 2 man job out of a 30 minute job.

I had never built a server before and the staff member I spoke with online was very friendly and helpful.There are 2 disappointing things about the server however, which is why I couldn\u2019t give them 5 stars.1. The machine came with a 3D printed back plate that contains the network ports and standard connections. It\u2019s not even a thick 3D printed plate and I\u2019m slightly concerned about it heating up and warping over time as the server sits in the rack. I was assuming that for $2500 I wouldn\u2019t end up with 3D printed parts.2.  The rack ears are about 1/8\u201d wider than standard rack ears. This means the server won\u2019t fit in my off-the-shelf rack case that I need to use it in. Right now it\u2019s just sitting in there, but I\u2019ll eventually need to take a grinder to the ears to get them to fit.So to recap, very happy with the core of the server and the service I received from SuperLogics, but a bit disappointed by the build itself."

The markups aren't awful or unreasonable, just a little bit more than what I can get elsewhere, so on *some* items like RAM (though the ECC RAM is as well-priced as anyone else's, somewhat to my surprise) and expansion/extra NIC's, PCI risers, etc., I wind up having to order them separately from other suppliers.Otherwise, working with SuperLogics has been great, and we will definitely be continuing to order from them as a happy customer!"
