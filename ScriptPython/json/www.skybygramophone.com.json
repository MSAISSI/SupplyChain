          "Contenu": "Had a 4 package order, one of the packages was not received. Told me to contact USPS which I did but they told me they couldn\u2019t do anything about it and sent me home with a delivery report saying they didn\u2019t have the package and for me to contact the shipper (skybygramophone). I contacted support and they were useless. They told me they couldn\u2019t help because the tracking info says delivered even though USPS literally provided a delivery report saying they don\u2019t have the item. They refused an official document (nor did they even ask for it), and once I brought up the notion of filing a suit for small claims court and asked who to address it to, they completely stopped responding. HORRIBLE service. Take your business elsewhere."

No explanation whatsoever. Ended up calling the (what I was told was) the store and they couldn't help. Poor service. Have to wonder if this is a scam to collect private info from people.Did finally get a call. The caller ID said (wireless caller) and the person said to call back but left no name or number. Called back the number I had and they didn't know anything about the call.Wireless Call on the caller ID? This is more and more sounding like a scam company."

I contacted ups on line to order a pickup and was informed the shipping labels they provided would require me to pay a fee. I called Gramophone and asked to speak with a supervisor and got Will. No apologies, no thanking me for being honest and saving them about $2000, just an attitude that I shouldn't be upset. He said it was normal for them to require the customer to take returns back to UPS and not be picked up and that he would make an exception in my case. His attitude was that he was doing me a favor by ordering a pick up. I gave him an earful ( no cursing just facts) They would have never known they sent out $2000 worth of equipment instead of my $500 order unless I called to let them know as it was dropped shipped from a distributor. Will is not appreciate of his customers and thinks they don't have a right to express their anger after 6 days of runaround when the customer is trying to do the right thing for them."

There is no web portal for me to review the current status of my order and phonecalls do not get theough.  I've called a half a dozen times.  I often speak to people on the sales floor of their local store, but they can't help with online orders.  They name the person \"upstairs\" who takes care of the online stuff.  They even say he can attach the order to my account for me.   But when they transfer me, it either goes to an answering machine or I am on hold for a few minutes before their system hard disconnects me.Am I getting the TV any time soon?  Am I on the list of first pre-orders? Do I have to wait longer? Am I being ghosted?  No idea unfortunately.   It's like a black hole after order.  The only follow up email I've got since order confirmation is asking for a review.  Two weeks without any other communication  :("

Somehow I came across SKY and the website said they had some in stock. I was lury and decided to call. I mistakenly called a store and the only two they had in stock was already sold and a demo. After mentioning I was an online buyer he looked at a different inventory and confirmed there were a few available. I went back online and placed my order. Said I would receive in 4 or 5 days. By days 5 I hadn't heard anything from them and decided to write and they very quickly responded and told me it would be shipped the next day. It was shipped out as they stated and I received it a day later. The only negative I could say about them is they really should double box their items to offer better protection than the original box the merchandise came in. I was really nervous opening the box but luckily everything was in tact with the exception of a couple broken Styrofoam pieces. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. The price was good,  being ex-military I received a discount and even better I wasn't taxed since I'm not a resident of MD or DC. I would definitely buy from them again!"

SKY pulled through for me before, during and after my purchase. Am very grateful, can't recommend this company enough!"

          "Contenu": "Long ago, I came to understand how easy it can be to fall short of others' expectations, both personally and professionally.  For that reason, I think being able to give a second chance to companies that admit an error and look to correct it, is in order.  The professional and timely response of Sky by Gramophone to the experience detailed below, has required me to take a second look at the company.  I've been contacted by the CEO of the company and called with follow up inquiries, all in an effort to ensure my issues were addressed.  Sky has worked hard to earn my future business and, for that reason, I will consider them for my future audio needs.I ordered the $449 Sumiko Wellfleet cartridge. Normally, my choice in audio stores is Crutchfield. In this case, Sky Gramophone was the only merchant with the Wellfleet in stock. When it arrived, I mounted it on the tone arm of my Pro-ject X-2 while wearing silk gloves and exercising extreme caution. Once on, the initial sound was less than ideal...not horrible,but nearly as good as my Moonstones or Amethyst.    I have a great deal of experience installing cartridges. I use an electronic balance, an azimuth tool, I keep the stylus protector on and I maintain a dust free environment. I examined the stylus with 1000x powered microscope.  When I informed Sky Gramophone of the defective product, they informed that it would need to be returned at my expense, with a 20% charge, a restocking fee, and that I would need to insure the return package. All of this added up to my losing $150 because Sky Gramophone sent a defective cartridge. But wait, it gets worse!  Days after receiving the Wellfleet, Sky Gramophone calls to tell me that I am responsible for the damaged cartridge. At this point, I am beginning my campaign to alert consumers about this company and its treatment of customers. I am also investigating what legal remedies I have."

          "Titre": "How can something be verified, in stock and ready to ship but the next day be on back order?",
          "Contenu": "When I purchased the receiver online, it stated that it was in stock. I called and they said that it was in stock and ready to ship. The next day, I received an email stating that the receiver was on backorder, so I immediately called again. The customer service representative told me that it was in stock but it was being shipped to another customer. I was shocked to hear of this. The representative told me that they are expecting another shipment to arrive 30 days later and it's company policy to charge for the item that is not in stock. My credit card was charged for the entire amount but I am waiting until the item returns in stock. I have never heard of that before. I have a sick feeling that the receiver will be discontinued, as it's a limited edition. Currently, it's sold out everywhere or being sold for double the MSRP. I feel like I was cheating out of my receiver for financial gain or it was being held for an employee. Either way I'm unhappy with this company and how they do business. If my receiver actually arrives to me, I will update my comments here with the status. Bottom line is everyone makes mistakes and I'm patient but don't tell me that I'm going to receive something and charge my credit card and I took an extra step to call and verify it, only to send me an email the next day saying that it's not in stock and I'm now waiting on backorder. Not good business practices and horrible customer service. Almost $6000 I have already paid for an item that I may not even receive. No updates have been received since I placed the order.Update! Sky Gramophone made it right between us and I am very proud of their customer support! Thank you for your kindness and understanding! I'm a customer for life! Great job!"
