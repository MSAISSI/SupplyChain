There was no delivery address to fill in, only the billing address. Delivery to the billing address should have been on the 10th October, two working days after ordering. It did not arrive and we left to fly to the USA on the 11th October. Communication has been poor - they promised a refund but I have chased this and have received no reply. To top it all, our baggage went missing and so I did not have phone SIM I could use to chase this up. Very disappointed. There is more to the story, all in all an exceedingly frustrating experience."

Then I bought a new SIM and plan with a different company, activated in person trouble-free.I reported my troubles to SIMS4USA three separate times and each time the only response was an invitation to provide a GOOD review. I asked for a full refund including delivery costs several times but no mention of a refund was made in response until AFTER I posted the original version of this review. I will revise again if the refund is made.My original review:You have ignored my complaints about non-delivery of service. This us my third time informing you. Without a response to the SUBSTANCE I have already submitted, I will be reporting you as fraud."

Very unhappy with this product.  After a few days, they offered to switch me to another package.  I agreed but then never heard any more about it.  Eventually had to go to another provider"

It wasn't as bad in Grand Forks, ND. The strength and consistency of the signal should also be noted before purchase. Canadian data signals are definitely more consistent however I understand that it will depend on how the agreements T-Mobile has and where t b E coverage is. We didn't expect coverage through the mountains but we did expect coverage in urban areas and highways with flatter terrain."

It made my arrival to the USA so smooth and easy since I absolutely needed Google Maps to get around as soon as I left the airport! I'd suggest the company to broaden maybe the offers since it's available only the monthly one, however it's quite expensive if you are staying for a shorter period of time. I stayed only for 2 weeks and I had to pay the monthly charge :/ that's the only \"downside\", but the connection works fast and it's reliable, so it's highly recommended regardless. I'd definitely use this service again."
