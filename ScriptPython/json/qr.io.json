There was nowhere in their site a reference about their pricing list nor did they mention anything about trial mode. I would not recommend using their service unless you are willing to pay annually 350 $."

Ok fair enough they never mention FREE on their site but there pricing structure remains elusive until you hunt for it and it lets you generate the QR codes without prompt or mention.They also come up as a top hit upon googling \"FREE QR generator\". They know exactly what they are doing. Shame on you all."

It came top of the advertising list when Googling \u201cFree to use QR codes\u201d, but having embedded one of their QR codes into a leaflet, which I had printed thousands of, I discovered upon scanning it to test (which I had done many times at the proofing stage) that the code had expired and I now need to pay $35 per month to subscribe to their plan and re-activate it. Nowhere was this made clear on their website. I've used many QR code generators over the years and have never been scammed in this way before.It seems from reading many other reviews that I\u2019m by no means their only victim, and makes me wonder how many other businesses/charities/individuals have been conned in this way, and wasted thousands in printing costs. Is a single one of their positive reviews genuine?Avoid this site at all costs."

Fortunately, I only mailed out a few items, so I made a new code on a free site and stickers to go over these expensive codes. Horrible business.UPDATE: after posting this review and contacting customer support, they offered me a plan to keep my code for $9 a month. So now that I have a premium plan at a more reasonable price, I see there is STILL no way to create a static code. Even though they advertise you can do both dynamic (needs subscription) and static (no subscription needed), they actually only allow you to create dynamic QR codes for which they can charge you.

Why so much when I can get the same service elsewhere for about $5 a month? So, I've printed some stickers to go over the QR.io versions and will never again touch the services of this unscrupulous company."

They also report difficulty stopping the subscription.I reached out to the company. Waiting to hear back. I'll be throwing out all my print advertising and starting with another company. I feel extorted by this company.11/16 Response: They replied to my email. They offered me a lower amount per month.   I don't need to know how many people click through the code.  I don't need to make multiple new codes a month. I need to keep my costs under control. The promotional items I bought will last me 3 to 5 years.  The interface to make the QR codes is fantastic.  They have managed to be the top of all search engines. I wasn't impressed with their response to me as a consumer. The website still has not cleared up the poor communication. It is not yet managing expectations to a degree most people will be able to use the service without problems. I would recommend people use another site.  I was not impressed with their follow up with me.11/17/23 Another response: Yesterday morning, after my TrustPilot complaint, another person from the company reached out to me.  Said they would activate my account for life.   I didn't check it yesterday but I checked it this morning.   It's not on."

I am absolutely devastated by this as we have a very tight wedding budget and have tried to do everything ourselves. There is so little transparency with QR.io.

Initially, the service seemed promising, offering the creation of QR codes, which appeared to be free. However, this turned out to be misleading. Major Issues:1. Deceptive Pricing: The QR code I created was deactivated after 7 days, revealing a hidden catch - a subscription fee of $35 per month to keep it active. This pricing is exorbitant, especially considering the basic nature of the service provided.2. Poor Customer Service: My attempts to address this issue with their team were met with indifference. Instead of acknowledging their deceptive practices, they offered a slightly reduced price of $12/month or a one-time purchase of $50, which still didn't justify the value.In conclusion, Qr.io's service was not only disappointing but also seemed to employ questionable business practices. The hidden costs, lack of proper customer support, and overall approach to business are concerning. I advise potential customers to be wary of these issues and consider other more transparent and cost-effective options available in the market. Rating: 1/5 - Highly Disappointing"

Clearly, this setup is designed to place users in a bind where they need to sign up, or risk their project being ruined (QR codes are usually used for print). I would have considered a subscription had the communications around this been more clear, but the experience has entirely put me off."

At $35 a month, the \"premium\" features of 1) Having the ability to HAVE a QR codeand2) Adding a little picture in the middleis extortionate, leading me to believe that this company runs off the ransom model I mentioned earlier.Avoid.Disclaimer to avoid a \"The notice was there\" message: When you RETURN to your dashboard, but not when you first enter it, a banner does appear telling you you are on a 7-day free trial. But a free account with no features is just an email address on somebody else's list."

When you set up a QR code, the option to choose a static code is hidden at the bottom of all of the options in greyed out text which I only found when I went back in looking for this option. It doesn't even look like an active link.Definitely a company that are out to trick people and not clear in their options up front. Have rated 2 as the QR code itself does work well. I've very reluctantly paid for a month to keep using the QR code which I need for a short while but will then be cancelling and never using again."

          "Contenu": "The custom QR code configurator is easy to use and has lots of options. The customer service department of this company is outstanding, and the primary reason I am giving four stars. BE WARNED that if you make a \"free\" QR code using the customization tool on the home page, it will stop working in a week when your free trial expires, as qr.io by default forces free QR codes to go through a forwarding URL so that they can discontinue service if you do not buy a subscription. Don't be like me and buy a bunch of prints with the free code on them, they will be useless in 7 days. That being said, even though I did not even pay for a subscription, I had multiple customer service representatives reach out to me to try to rectify my situation, and they were consistently professional, courteous, and generous. I would recommend using this service if you regularly need QR codes or if you run a business that would benefit from these services and the reliable support offered by qr.io.Second edit: This problem of not telling people their free code will expire has existed for quite some time. There are dozens if not hundreds of reviews over the past 18 months of people using a supposedly free code and having access cut off without warning. One person even used these codes for wedding invitations only to be forced into a $35/month subscription fee when the code stopped working. I have taken an additional star off due to the apparent lack of concern this company has for people getting duped by their trap."

I am upgrading the review to three stars because of the response from customer support, however two stars deducted for the experience overall. DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE - QR.io have conveniently forgotten to inform customers in anyway prior to using their service that it is only free for 7 days, after which the dynamic qr code will not work unless you pay \u00a328 a month or ten times that for a year. Total disgrace. They are also making a habit or not cancelling subscriptions in a timely manner. They also automatically set the qr codes to dynamic when you are creating them. Only the static we codes are free and you only learn this after reading through a lot of small print.In my opinion this is predatory and QR.io need to add this information in a clear and understandable format so people are given the info whilst they are creating their codes\u2026 before they are trapped by their service."

This is ridiculous and once I no longer need access to my QR code I am never using this site again. I would caution anyone else to steer clear of making QR codes with this website because it is a scam. They make false promises and then use your need to extract money from you.I wrote the above review after having a poor experience with the QR.io, but after my review was posted the level of customer service I received was wonderful. I have since used the site more and am happy with its capabilities. I would say that it definitely meets my needs, and for anyone looking to use the service in the future I wouldn't advise against as long as they were aware of whether or not they would be charged."

Thankfully, they were understanding and allowed me to keep the QR code active. Beyond that misfortune, I must admit that their platform is well-made and easy to use. If your business requires making QR codes on a regular basis, it is definitely a service worth considering. Original review: Unless you plan on using their paid services, do not use QR.io. I recently made a QR code using their platform on the free trial. Their advertising put me under the impression that the codes made during the trial would stay active. So I had business cards made and printed using their service. When I received my business cards printed, I was disappointed to realize that the QR code did not work, essentially rendering them worthless. Then, I contacted them about it. They offered me to pay 50 USD to keep the QR code active. I felt cornered into either having to waste money to keep a QR code alive or waste money to get new business cards printed with a functional QR code. From other reviews online, I see I'm not the only one. There are other truly free services to get QR codes done with similar functionalities, and I recommend anyone looking to make a QR code and doesn't need any fancy features to NOT use QR.io. It might not legally be a scam, but their behaviour of cornering people into paying them to avoid wasting money they put into printing QR codes after being misled by their advertising is certainly akin to that of scammers."

I then put these qr codes on 250 of my business cards so now I'm going to be forced to pay a monthly bill just so my business cards work. I am not very happy at all with how things presented themselves. They give you the \"Option\" to choose a static or dynamic qr code, but their \"static\" option is a tiny fine print option at the bottom of the page which you will never find or see unless you're looking for it. Moral of the story, make sure you know everything before setting something in stone. I was a fool and now I'm literally paying for it. Other than that however the program works great and does what it says it does"

The company comes up if you search for \"free qr code generator.\" But the product is not free (except for the 7 day trial). That being said, it is a good product and we did go on with a paid plan for the tracking purposes - and because we had already printed products with the qr codes before we had the notice that our \"free trial\" had expired and now the qr codes we generated were not active. As most should know however, anything that sounds too good to be true, probably is. So, I blame myself for not searching out the site further. Were there a \"pricing\" tab in the header with clear information before getting hooked, I'd give the product 5 stars."

It had never occurred to me that they would disable my QR code and hold it hostage until I paid them money to keep it alive.  That resulted in my first, very negative, review here.  However, upon seeing that review, qr.io quickly contacted me and offered a very satisfactory resolution, which I happily accepted.  They didn't ask me to change the review, but I am changing it to reflect my appreciation for their having rectified the situation through excellent customer service.  I can't quite get to five stars because of the substantial miscommunication of their initial offer, but I can go with four stars happily.  The service still looks useful, albeit a bit pricey.  Just beware that the free trial period is not just for creating QR codes but also for having them continue to function, which I've recommended to qr.io that they disclose when you sign up for the free trial."

However, I decided to not sit down and accept my defeat, I contacted them through email (which I suggest is better than filling in the contact form!). Within an hour, I got a response from Carolina. Carolina was very kind to offer me two options; either a discount per month or a one-time payment. We ended up with the one-time payment, and it was easily done. We received a one-time payment link and the qr-code worked again the second we paid. Thank you for the quick service, Carolina! I didn't give five stars because of the seven days trial, which could have been communicated better, or a better view of the differences between a static and a dynamic code. Nonetheless, I am very happy that our qr code is working again, as it was printed on growing paper, and there was no way of changing that!"
