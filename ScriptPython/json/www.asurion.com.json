At this location or any location? She dunno. I try calling different locations but whatever option I chose on the voicemail the call was immediately disconnected.

My phone was an 11 X pro, which is a little bit older and it was more because of that.I ended up going into AT&T where they were running a promotion which was MUCH cheaper than using the insurance that I\u2019ve been paying for..And even more frustrating, it took hours on the phone before and after, only for them to tell me that basically they don\u2019t care. And unless you\u2019re willing to have a customer rep repeat to you over and over again why they are unwilling to help you, just skip getting customer service at all..You will not be able to get a supervisor on the phone."

Then on a separate occasion, we had Asurion as the protection plan through our mobile carrier. Of course something happened to a phone and I went to the site to file a claim. At first, they tried to tell me I wasn't covered. Then finally when I got then to fix my account, I went through the claim process, and still got the same message, \"Unfortunately, we are unable to complete your claim on the web at this time.\" Come to find out, even the sales rep says he always has to call the phone number because their website never works. Now I discover that there is a deductible, and that it's almost as much as I paid for the device.I've spent MONTHS trying to get this resolved. The *only* thing even worth ONE star is that the actual repair techs are pretty helpful -- but that's because they are Asurion employees, they work for companies that Asurion contracts through -- Asurion doesn't actually do anything themselves. I hope the company goes bankrupt."

My replacement phone is not working properly at all, not even two weeks old and I need it for work. Long story short, Hours and hours of trying to get someone to take responsibility for this new phone is a nightmare. Asurion sends me to Virgin to get a tech ID# before they will start a claim. Virgin sends me to a store an hour away. The store doesn't have a tech team so Asurion sends me back to Virgin. Virgin then tells me that the drive wasn't necessary and that the tech team can troubleshoot remotely and then give me a tech ID#. If I had known that getting a replacement phone was going to be this painful I would have just bought a new phone as my original was paid off."

Next step is they ask for a photo to identify the item. Take a picture of all identifying serial and model numbers. In my case there were three non-functioning security cameras. I newly acquired VZ modem made connecting them to the WiFi impossible. Two were submitted. A while latee the third one was submitted. Meanwhile denials and requests for more proofs were stated to be required. The third claim went out. The redone claims with new pics went out. Denials came in requiring a third redo of the claim filing. Then the third claim got denied. More requests bombarded me. Now totally confused. I refused to go forward. I began to feel that I was being drawn into double claiming and being guilty of fraud. There was no going back nor forward. Text messages kept coming. Confusion mounted. Frustration mounted. I was willing to just send all three non-functioning cams in to Asurion. Pics were not serving anyone well. All claims were being continually denied. The process was a broken merry-go-round. Be aware that the pictures submitted were wonderfully close-up and clear. The back of each cam had its name and a bold black numeral and letter sequence. That is all that there was.Do not pay Verizon or any company for any Asurion insurance product plan.11/07/23 The company's response was to whitewash the negative review. There has been no caring contact nor action taken by non-caring tech device insurance company, Asurion."

I spoke with Dex on 7/24 who told me no need to send the broken phone back since it was already paid in full.

Every time I call ATT I\u2019m on hold 30 minutes.  I am very irritated with this experience. Spoke with Daphanie today which took an hour. No resolve, she said she was sending another return label.

She needs the laptop everyday for school work and it would've been a lot easier if Asurion could work with us to minimize the down-time.It appears impossible to get a live person at Asurion and the chat agent told me the only way to use the coverage was to send it to them.  At least they're not flat out denying the coverage, which is why this is a 2-starrer."

At the end, I had to wait with a cracked screen, which affected by business greatly. They get two stars because the one tabled did arrive on time."

I called Verizon customer support,  which turned out to be Asurion, for help.  I had to start with a low-level technician who had me go through many steps that I had already tried based on information I found on the internet.  After about 45 minutes, he transferred me to a high-level technician who spent more than an hour troubleshooting the problem.   It was late,  and I told him I would call back the next day.  When I did, I got another low-level technician.  I explained what happened the night before and asked to be transferred to a high-level technician.  He insisted that I allow him to troubleshoot the problem.  I reluctantly complied.  After an hour,  he transferred me to a high-level technician.   Keep in mind every time you call or are transferred, you have to wait a considerable amount of time.   I spent five or six days with technicians and did not get my problem solved.  I totaled my time on the phone, and it came to 48 hours.  I called Verizon customer support and explained what had happened.  The Verizon rep was shocked.  He helped me fix the phone and wrote a report about my experience with Asurion. He told me Asurion should have had me go to a Verizon store and arrange to send the phone to Asurion and/or replace the phone.   For my troubles,  Verizon gave me a handsome credit to my account. ,"

She called the Verizon help line (we have AT&T), then after bungling a couple more attempts, she provided me no less than 3 phone numbers to call. By the time we figured out the correct number to call, the call center was closed (by 15 mins). So she left and told me I have to call in the morning. I called the number she gave me, was incorrect. Finally figured out the number to call, was then transferred to the business account department. Then I had to complete another claim on the phone that was defective. The phone was sent Fed Ex, not early morning priority. Got the phone late afternoon, set it up and the SIM card wasn't working. Called in, went through the BS and find out SIM was fine, but someone had de-activated the number, so that was fun. Not impressed."

Also since i am a senior I am not clear exactly how it will work to get my data transferred over,  I tried to go in and chat with the service people but website kept wanting me to enter code they sent by text on my cell phone - I can't open my cell phone it is broken which is why I filed a claim.  I don't know exactly what will happen when I get my replacement phone.  I went by ATT store and they said they can't transfer the data when I get my new phone, they weren't allowed to so I don't know how this will work,  maybe I will be updating this review by then. I can't say I am happy with this insurance, I paid out 1200. over 6 years and had a deductible for 112. and they are replacing mine with a phone that came out in 2020 that can be bought for 250.00 so I am out of pocket 1000. which would buy me a current phone so somehow I way overpaid for this replaement phone.  I will see how much trouble it is to set it up when I receive it in the mail and if I can find a way for someone to walk me through it, I may have lost all my contacts and texts on my broken phone.  You have to be tech savvy to get a phone in the mail and do it yourself which is not me."

While I'm glad I did, I'm not totally satisfied but it's better than getting nothing on a phone loss.  Here's the fine print you don't realize until you go thru a claim:1) you have to pay a $49 deductible2) I bought my phone and insurance on Amazon so the refund is in the form of an Amazon e-gift card3) that means you have to get a new phone on your own dime first to transfer from the old phone (if it's still working) or to even have a new phone (some of us can't live long without one).4) that e-gift is not sent to you until you send back the old phone and they verify that it's really broken, i.e., time delay.Bottom line, factor in the cost of the insurance plus the deductible plus the cost of the phone."

It was in my pocket the whole time. So when I go to make my claim no questions asked about details. The guy says the screen is broke and we can fix it for free but it'll take a long time or we can replace it for $99.00. I told him that I didn't do anything for it to have broken, he didn't care.Something had to be wrong with the phone for it to have cracked the way it did. I also forgot to mention that it was in a case and had a screen protector."

Still things are going along well enough.  I did have to call tech support for help with some issues; the tech was patient and helpful, she managed to solve most of the issues quickly.  The one issue is still about downloading my photos and apps - it just takes time.  I'm willing to wait a day or so and see how things go but right now I'm satisfied with how things are progressing.

However, that's on my side of this story.  On the flip side, my total experience with Asurion and my device claim was very minimal with regards to time spent filing all the way to turning on my new replacement device. Less than 24 hours!  There were not a bunch of forms or hoops to jump through and that is the way it should be.  More companies in any  field or industry could learn from Asurions claim processes,etc.  THANK you all very much."
