There was no warning selecting this option would make my app a private app, and so I had hundreds of unhappy users unable to access it since it caps at 50 private users on $99/month (that pricing, jeez...) - I now have a quote on Upwork to build the app (which I'll be able to host on a tiny $10/month server) for $280, meanwhile, even the $249/month plan doesn't have enough private users (only 100!) to support my userbase which is around 500 users... so it would cost probably $4-5k+ per year to run my usecase with Glide or you can get it for $280 one-time on Upwork + $10/m for a cheap server - it's laughable these guys are acting like they're making app building accessible... make sure you get a quote on Upwork first if you're only building something simple, Glide pricing is predatory."

          "Contenu": "I would really like to give Glideapps 5 stars. It takes a little while to get the gist of it but once you do the tech is amazing. The singular problem is support!!1) I originally bought a template that I had to move between domains due to the Google verification process. No probs pretty straightforward. Done it hundreds of times across other platforms.In the Glide post payment process the template got well lost. And instead of helping resolve the issue their response was to blame the vendor. Despite the fact the purchase was undertaken on their platform. Once I cleared that up and they agreed that they were responsible they were in fact useless as they did nothing. Choosing instead to stick their heads in the sand and ignore me. Leaving it to the vendor of the template to be kind enough to resolve their problem by sending me the template. 2) Roll on a week+. Following direct support advice I migrated my template to a new account and followed their directions to the letter. Ensuring I removing all external permissions within the Glide environment.  So when the old domain expired and my google sheet with ALL my hard work was was deleted I was pissed. And supports reaction?\"Glide's back end can not delete a Google Sheet, and never has been able to delete a sheet.  You can replace the link to a Google sheet in an existing app by going to Settings>>Data Data Sources and select the 3 dot menu.  You have to make sure that the sheet that you select has the exact same sheets and columns that the original one had.  Google does retain deleted sheets for a period of time so you should be able to recover the Google Sheet.  I suggest you work with Seth as he is the one who set you up with the app outside of the Template store process.\"What I've come to expect from  Glide Support1) In response I sent them a link to Google sheets message stating the sheet had been deleted. Wrong! Support response - nothing!2) You would expect a quick workaround would be to export data from the CMS and just reattach file to template, right? I tried, the naming conventions on tabs have been changed and who knows what else. So I asked support to confirm.Support response - nothing.3) Finally the Glide support playbook 101 -  blame the vendor again \"I suggest you work with Seth as he is the one who set you up with the app outside of the Template store process\" date 17th JulyReally, that's not exactly true is it? From Glide support:\"Sorry we haven't replied sooner. There's an issue with some templates, and our engineering team is working on it.\" 5th July. As a result of the crap I went through to get my template. Showing 100% Glide's responsibility\"Sorry about my previous message, based on the PDF attached I assumed it was a purchase in XXXXX vs ours. I see that you've purchased the template in Glide.\" 2nd July - showing 100% Glide's responsibilityFinally, lets not forget that the only reason the vendor sent me the template in the first place is because your platform failings which you have clearly confirmed. Your support is beyond clueless and so to blame him now for your failings is to my mind beyond outrageous!!!!Great platform - support are clearly on VERY powerful medication.EDITI would like to add lazy as F*** to the list of reviews for Glide app.Found the problem. Asked community support for a fix, who pointed me back to support with a resolution. Asked support if they could follow the resolution as outlined by the certified community support staff.Response? dead airWell FU2!"

That's pretty much unusable in my case. Also, what if you need to keep some of those messages longer? Or just save the last 100 messages from each user? Maybe I don't understand how the chat component works - but the fact remains that there is no easy way to automatically purge old data."

Sometimes it takes minutes or more to change numbers calculated by formulas, especially when you have complex formulas. This prevents me from creating more demanding apps. It is not always like this. Sometimes it works. That is why it is unreliable for me. You never know what you will get."

Not sure how to word this, but Glide's \"features\" or mechanics just work. Upon building an app, never ran to any hiccups which was amazing. What I dislike about Glide and I might be in the minority with this, but I feel like as a new costumer who has never done anything like this before, the function/mechanics of Glide got to be a bit confusing and borderline frustrating sometimes. It might be my lack of knowledge on the subject, but at the same time it becomes challenging when a person want the app to do something and they're unsure how to either make that happen or what do each function do so that they can make it happen themselves, without relying so heavily on the aids from others in the forums. I feel like the company is doing well with having experts under their belt and utilizing them to help out the next generation of Glide users. How the company can improve is that I wish Glide had a better \"store\" system in place. My original vision for Glide is for it to have an Apple-like app store with tones of Glide user designed apps for the picking. I also feel or at least at the time, Glide defiantly needs to make sure that they keep up with their tutorials so that it mirrors as close to the latest updated features as possible. Nothing like a deflated moment of checking out a tutorial, but it's like night and day."

          "Contenu": "Glide brings app building to many people for who it previously would not have been possible.I have been able to make high quality, responsive web and mobile apps (not native) for my company without knowing how to code.The team appears to focus on making components that are clean, easy to use, and of a high quality. I love that the product is so visually pleasing both for the app developer and app user, whilst also being very functional.One thing I particularly enjoy is not having to deal with responsiveness as is the case with competing products. All the components are 100% responsive on all devices and you simply have to set up how they work with the data. There is a small customisation trade-off to note as a result.I also love that you can connect multiple data sources to your app. E.g. a table from Google Sheets, a table from Glide Tables, a table from Airtable. Data can also be used across multiple apps.At this stage, Glide is still young and so there are some features to be desired. That being said, the community is super helpful and there is often a workaround for the occasional thing I can\u2019t do natively. The Glide team has their heads down and are rolling out new features every week.Overall, after trying many different no-code app builders, Glide is the one I have landed on because of its mix of quality and ease-of-use, not to mention speed of development.If you are creating a tool for a business (and not trying to build the next Twitter or something totally unique), then Glide is probably for you!"

          "Contenu": "I collected the company's internal information scattered in the Google spreadsheet, and I'm creating an internal information system that allows all members of the company to easily access information, and that allows to maintain a single database.I've tried several no-code tools, but Glide is the most intuitive and has the lowest running curve. Data linkage with Google spreadsheets and Airtables is excellent, design quality is higher than other services, and also I can create the desired service through various functions such as filters, groups, and actions. It's also very attractive to offer features that enable CUSTOM CSS, and also price is reasonable compared to other services. Most other services only support web browsers, but Glide provides features that can be used on mobile in a form similar to native apps. In addition, when Apple made an update to provide Push Notification in browser, Glide team updated their service to support that feature in just a few days. I highly appreciate and commend you for continuing to upgrade features with quick updates.Of course, there are some weaknesses. As of now, some features provided by the Glide app, such as dark themes or login screen background images, are not yet fully available on the Glide page. Glide team is working on it, so I expect it to be available if I wait a few more weeks. Also, I want to make the uploaded PDF file downloaded directly as a file, but it appears in the form of a preview in the browser and I can't change it. I've spent a lot of time trying to solve this problem, but I still couldn't make it. I'm using Google Drive as an alternative, but then I can't upload files directly from Glide, and I have to enter the URL of the Google Drive or should use Glide's Google Drive webform, which make inconvenience to the user experience.Although there are these issues, I still think Glide is the most attractive no-code tool. Thank you for the Glide team."

Not a manager, not a developer but a  proper business analyst. Glide is the perfect tool of the analyst. For \"safety\" reasons it would be long to develop here, you can mainly develop Information System for small business. But i'm pretty sure to be able to develop for large organizations pretty soon; Glide team is moving fast in the good direction. After Airtable, Glide will be soon for sure one of the few great tech companies."

With that first experience I'm now working on 2 new ideas. Another advantage of Glideapp, I don't make wireframes ... I make the life app immediately usable ... and build from there ... in direct connection with the future users."

Especially when dealing with special Airtable field types such as Multiple select or Linked fields. The integration is a lot better since the arrival of linked records update through choice components, but it's sometimes difficult to update or add values into a linked record field that relates multiple linked records (1-n relationships).Also, it would be good to have access to the same components in Glide pages that we have in Glide apps (e.g. e-sign component).Even with these little limitations, Glide is today my N\u00b01 choice when there is a need to design interfaces."

As a non-technical person, I was able to create a complex and feature-rich app for my small business in just a few hours, without writing any code. The drag-and-drop interface and pre-built templates made it incredibly simple to build the app I wanted. I love how complex the backend can be with computed columns and even javascript columns!The app itself is fantastic - it looks professional and has all the features I need to connect with my customers and grow my business. I've been amazed at how quickly I've been able to get it up and running, and how easy it is to make updates and changes as needed.Overall, I highly recommend GlideApps to anyone looking to create an app for their business. Whether you're a technical person or not, it's an incredible tool that will help you build a beautiful, functional app in no time. Five stars!"

So, my only ask would be: For Glide to have a plan I could purchase that will allow unlimited row data usage (without hitting some sort of cap). This would allow me to grow my app and possibly hold an unlimited amount of users. Other than this I love Glide. Your team has brought my idea to life. Shoutout to your Glide Expert Robert Petitto.

          "Contenu": "Honestly, I can't believe Glide is free. It's true that the free accounts are limited, but for making hobby apps and learning how to use the software, it was very practical and was not limiting at all. I made several apps that were personally useful to me. And it's not until I was confident enough to start making apps for work (I work in education) and play (I volunteer for a non-profit tennis league) that I hit the limitations of the free account because of the number of users and edits using the app every month. I have a rudimentary knowledge of programming and am proficient at spreadsheets, but glide allows me to do things that I would never be able to program on my own and it is very intuitive. Coded spreadsheets that were cumbersome to use and had low capabilities due to my limited programming knowledge, are now apps that are streamlined, used from my phone, and blow people's minds. It's like what Dreamweaver was for websites, but better. I only wish the apps would work offline... and that toggle switches/boolean column edits wouldn't count toward the monthly edit count. The customer service is excellent with very short response times and I find the basic plan is good value, but the next higher plan is a big jump, especially if you are doing non-profit work. As a Canadian, I also wish the invoice would state that the price paid is in American currency. It would make my life much easier if they would put USD $25 instead of just $25."

I love the fact that the apps don't need to be downloaded and it's 2 clicks for my users to install the app on their home screen.I can build small, medium or even enterprise apps with massive capacity as my projects grow.I started building Glide Apps at the start of covid lockdown in 2020 (coming from the construction industry) and i turned this into my new career path within 2 days, zero cash down and no prior experience.I'm loving the laptop lifestyle that Glide offers me and i'd recommend Glide to anyone."
