There are plenty better surveys sites out there. I would mention then but dont know if im allowed to or not on this.

          "Contenu": "Like most survey sites, at first the surveys are relatively easy to qualify for, have a reasonable payoff, and you can accumulate enough points for a reward in a short period of time, sometimes the first day or two.  But the longer you are a member, the number of surveys dwindle, they become more difficult to qualify for, and the amount of points per minute ratio decreases rapidly.  It becomes hard to reconcile taking a survey that requires 30 minutes of your time and only get 30 points...which is .01 per minute, or a \"pay rate\" of 60 cents per hour.  All too frequently the time required is greatly underestimated so a survey advertised at 10 minutes you are only halfway through 15 minutes later.  So my advice to those who rate these surveys, or who read them, make sure you read the ones from people who have been the service for a month or so, not just the ones who have had it for a week."

          "Contenu": "Prime Opinion initially presented itself as a promising platform for earning rewards through online surveys. The platform boasted a diverse range of surveys, a straightforward payout system, and a user-friendly interface. However, recent experiences have revealed a decline in the quality and productivity of the surveys offered.Screening Out and DisqualificationsOne of the most frustrating aspects of Prime Opinion is the high frequency of screening out and disqualifications. Users often invest time in completing surveys, only to be disqualified at the end, receiving no compensation for their efforts. This occurs even after completing qualifying questions and providing accurate information.Painful and Time-Consuming SurveysThe quality of surveys has also deteriorated significantly. Many surveys are poorly designed, repetitive, and unnecessarily lengthy. They often ask redundant questions and provide confusing instructions, leading to frustration and wasted time. The excessive length of some surveys makes them feel like a chore rather than a rewarding experience.Declining RewardsThe rewards offered for completing surveys have also become measly. The compensation no longer reflects the time and effort invested in these surveys. The payout thresholds have increased, making it more difficult to redeem rewards.ConclusionPrime Opinion has unfortunately fallen short of its initial promise. The frequent screening out, poorly designed surveys, and meager rewards have turned a once-productive platform into a frustrating and disappointing experience. Users are advised to seek alternative survey platforms that offer better compensation and a more worthwhile experience."

          "Titre": "Unethical researchers abound and Prime Opinion sets no limits to protect both researcher AND participant",
          "Contenu": "This company does NOT hold their researchers to any standards.  Studies say they'll take 15-minutes, they take 30-minutes or longer and then the study can screen you out up until the last question.  This has happened to me multiple times, it is not a rarity like the company would have you believe and at least twice, I thought the screen was changing because the study was finished and I was getting paid, but instead, they screened me out after the study was finished and paid me 3-cents for 29-minutes of my time.  I'm all for companies setting a certain criteria to be met for their research, but it should be in a reasonable amount of time ie 5-minutes to find out if you're what they're looking for.  Not after you answer all their screening questions, complete their studies and then screen you out right at the end.  And EVERY study will take at least 2-3X what the study says.  And a lot of studies will screen you out, which is fair enough, but they take way too long for it and most pay nothing when they screen you out, not even 3 or 4 cents.  You never know until you're paid that you're actually going to get paid for the time you put in.  I've only been on Prime Opinion 9-days and this is my experience.  The rate per hour on Prime Opinion is dismal and you have to be desperate for every penny to make this worth your time.Until Prime Opinion sets some ethical standards for their researchers, this will be an exercise in frustration for all.  Other survey sites have standards for the researchers to follow, so they can't just set out to take advantage of you, it's clear Prime Opinion has not done that and does not seem to want to do that in the future.  It's just commonsense that they should try to protect both sides, but they don't seem to care about the participants getting screwed by unethical researchers and to my knowledge even when you're screened out the researcher can still use your data.If you're going to get paid, they pay promptly, but you never know until the end if that's the case.Update:  Response to Prime OpinionI have done a lot of surveys on Prime Opinion, screening you out is not unusual and I don't have a problem with that if I don't fit the demographic, HOWEVER, the researchers are asking you the demographic questions, then letting you start or complete a survey for anywhere up to in my case 29-minutes was the longest and then screen you out after the last question and Prime Opinion allows this, because I did complain and on this occasion was told that the researchers can screen you out at anytime.  They should not be allowed to just waste your time.  They should ask any questions that may eliminate you upfront and not have you complete most of a study before screening you out.  Just tonight I spent 20-minutes or more on a study that was only suppose to take 10-minutes (all studies are 2-3X the estimate) and in that 20-minutes I had completed 70% of a study and was screened out.The fact that Prime Opinion replied the way you did trying to give the impression that screening out is a reasonable part of the business and doesn't happen that often, shows you will never do anything or set standards to improve the situation of abuse by the researchers.  I have acknowledged multiple times that screening out is reasonable as long as it's ALSO done in a REASONABLE amount of time, allowing you to complete 70-100% of a study before screening you out is NOT reasonable.  Even screening you out 10% into a survey is not reasonable.  Screening questions should be asked prior to starting the study.  I even got screened out of a study yesterday that said I qualified after the so-called demographic questions etc and then it said that \"there are no correct answers, we just want your opinion\" and I was still screened out after completing a decent amount of the study, clearly there were correct answers.  Screening questions should not include the survey itself, screening questions should be asked prior to the survey.It is clear that Prime Opinion does not intend to set standards making researchers ask all \"elimination questions\" upfront and in a reasonable amount of time, taking 20-30 minutes to screen you out is NOT reasonable, it's abusive."

Some extra benefits include the weekly run (IF you are lucky enough to get answerable surveys) and the increasing level bonuses."

However, one must be quick in their selection and relatively quick in their answering. The surveys tend to fill up fast. I also wish the screen-out process was a bit more thorough, and the compensation reward cap higher than 4 points. I've been screened out of surveys after answering for 15 minutes sometimes. On the whole, though, Prime Opinion does have good surveys and pays well."

The amount of times you'll enter a survey, give them valuable information for sometimes up to 6 or 7 mins only for them to get to the part where they actually decide if you're a match and kick you out.The criteria to decide whether you're a match should be given in the first minute or two or it's grossly unfair and frustrating.All in all it's a good way of making a few extra pounds if you can deal with a lot of frustration."

Very good customer support that is chat based and is real people, not AI like most others (Swagbucks).  They have very good rewards as well and is simple to survey with.  The biggest positive for me is when you don't qualify for a survey it is at the beginning, quick disqual if you aren't their demographic, and you don't spend 10 mins before being screened out (other than some non-credits).  The redemptions are immediate and has a large variety of gift cards or payments to choose from.I have been a member for a short time, but give it a A+ to start."

Additionally, the platform offers the option to donate if you're feeling generous, adding a charitable dimension to your participation.One notable feature is the daily availability of a diverse selection of surveys that you can qualify for, enhancing your earning potential. While it's true that the pay may be slightly lower compared to some claims, in my opinion, Prime Opinion remains one of the best-paid survey platforms. It's important to note that, like any survey platform, some surveys may take longer than estimated, which is a common aspect of this type of opportunity."
