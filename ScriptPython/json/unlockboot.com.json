I'm back and forth with them.You tell them you follow the instructions but they keep telling you to repeat the same process.Sent me a link to track something I already received, that didn't work.About refunds, I think you have to do too much to get a refund like record videos.Tried another unlocking company prior to this one.They were unsuccessful but had no issues refunding my money.Sorry but I won't be ordering anything from you guys again."

The last email I received from them was Nov 13 and I just emailed them again today (Nov 19) for an update on my refund. They seem very unprofessional and do not keep promises. My receipt says \"The chip should work 100% \u2013 if for any reason it\u2019s not working we will issue you a full refund.\" But they have been trying to avoid delivering on this promise.

Immediate bait and switch regarding the advertised \"simple process\" to unlock phone using a code. The very next day I received an update note to my order that instead of receiving a code to enter to unlock phone I had to now go through a remote unlocking procedure by their tech who would be accessing my personal computer. I was hesitant at first about allowing someone access to my computer but went ahead with the process anyways. MY MISTAKE! I spent 1-2 HOURS dealing with Stephan or Stefan, who tried to get my phone unlocked. I consider myself fairly competent with electronics but Stephan was EXTREMELY RUDE and UNPROFESSIONAL. After all that time he was NOT ABLE TO UNLOCK MY PHONE! I told him I wanted a full refund and he said that he could only give a partial refund back. Wow, crappy to say the least. Paid $26.10 and received a refund of $19.11 back. I WILL NEVER USE THEIR SERVICE AGAIN AND WILL RECOMMEND OTHERS TO AVOID THEM AS WELL.**IN RESPONSE TO UNLOCKBOOT'S RESPONSE**MY PHONE WAS CONNECTED TO MY COMPUTER THROUGH THE USB PORT AS DIRECTED THE WHOLE TIME YOUR TECH WAS TRYING TO WORK ON IT. DON'T LIE TO THE READERS OF THIS REVIEW."

Once again they want a video, pictures, your name in blood which I sent(no blood,) and he blocks me on Facebook Messenger. This company is crooked so buy at your own risk. If it works for you great but if not your money is gone as their money back guarantee is no guarante. Two adapters both failing EXACTLY the same way on my Spectrum iPhone, but they claims it works. They lied as it doesn't work. Their support is a complete joke!"

          "Contenu": "I carefully reviewed the website's refund policy before purchasing an unlock service, which explicitly claimed a 100% money-back guarantee for all services. However, upon making the purchase, I discovered that certain pages indicated the purchase was nonrefundable. The only alternative was to purchase a card-attached sticker or opt for a store credit refund, which seemed rather impractical.Despite my attempts to contact the company three times to cancel my order immediately after purchase, the unlocking process remained unresolved. Regrettably, my requests for a refund were rejected on all three occasions, with the company insisting that a refund was impossible.Eventually, out of frustration, I reluctantly agreed to receive store credit as a refund, thinking it was better than receiving nothing at all, especially when the company was unwilling to return the money. However, this decision became a point of contention, with the company trying to persuade me to withdraw my negative review.It's crucial to remember that a review reflects the result of one's experience. I would advise anyone considering a purchase on this website to exercise caution and scrutinize every word in their refund policy, as it's clear that their claims of a money-back guarantee can't be trusted."

They let me know they have been blocked by their payment processor and told to me to wait a week on the refund and to remove my review. If I don\u2019t get the refund in a week \u201cI can rewrite my review\u201d I told them no I have waited 64 days and to refund me now and I will remove the review. They emailed back in all caps telling me to REMOVE IT NOW! I again said no and that I would edit my review to reflect the emails. They then told me in a week when they are able to refund me they will just reply to the review stating they refunded. By all means I truly hope that is true but I am NOT holding my breath. If their payment processor blocked them that speaks volumes. Do yourself a favor and stay away. I wish I could post pictures to show proof of my claims! Don\u2019t do it! I have been waiting since 4-30-2023 for my unlock. Finally just yesterday 7-2-2023 they claim my phone can not be unlocked. They say it is blacklisted I knew my phone wasn\u2019t blacklisted but I still paid $28 for a detailed report to prove my phone is not blacklisted. I have been asking for 2 days for a refund and still no response. If it let me upload pictures I would without a doubt. I have been waiting roughly 64 days and they have now left me on read with no response. I paid for 2 devices to be unlocked and now I guess I need to go through my bank to get a refund. Worst part they never reached out to me. I guess they were hoping I would forget and the time would lapse for a refund. The people that are getting their phones unlocked immediately could literally get it done for free from the carrier. Do not fall victim to this! I have been so patient through the whole process until I had to find out from their site my order was \u201con hold\u201d then after messaging them upon seeing it I waited 5 days for a response that told me to email them. I emailed and they do not respond. I will update if they decide to actually assist me."

BUT one of the first emails they sent threatens you not to leave a bad review OR they will blacklist your IMEI. They mocked me on chat stating that NASA could not even do what I asked. Never even used their service (paid for nothing) and they refused to refund (ok i made a mistake but why be rude, mocking, and threatening). RED FLAG???? They threaten on the first email!!! I followed their instructions and contacted them because I felt their website was misleading at best. Instead of them ending it where \"everyone is happy\" as stated in their email, they would rather just keep my money for nothing. Lesson learned. Regardless, now i live in fear that they will do something to my phones IMEI. Read it for yourself.

          "Contenu": "This review is simply based on my experience with the company and is not intended to be a definitive overview of the company as a whole.  With that said, I ordered the unlocking service code for my phone on 2/20/2023 and on 2/21/2023 I received email instructions on what to do next (keep in mind I ordered a code) to connect my device to my computer & give them access to it through TeamViewer.  I did all that and connected to their chat and Stephan was the tech that connected and began doing some process & then abruptly stopped and told me that I had to pay an extra $20 and that I had to wait till today 2/23/2023 after 8 AM.  He wouldn't answer any questions as to what he had already done or needed to do further and told me not to ask any questions and just do as he said.  I insisted that he at least tell me what he had done or intended to do and why I needed to wait till today and all he said was that the server shut down at 2 PM Eastern but refused to answer anything else.  I inquired about getting a refund IF no one would explain anything to me and all my messages were read by Stephan & James who are the 2 techs that appears on my chat and no one replied after reading the questions.  This company may very well be a rather decent and reputable company, but in my situation I have had the worst experience and the customer service again in my situation sucks.  I also magically can't seem to check my order status on their site using my order number and the email that I used to make the order.I DID NOT REFUSE to use the USB connecion, Stephan had access to my computer and began a process....there was no attempt to refund me yesterday as stated in your reply...it wasn't until today that Stephan replied to me and asked me for the order number and it wasn't until after that that I received an email stating that a refund would be issued.  My initial review did not attempt to paint your company as a bad one, but rather I had a bad experience with you guys...so please don't lie on the facts because there are time stamps on emails and chat records so I could post those here showing where I begged for a reply yesterday and there was none and that there was no reply from you guys until today AFTER I had left the original review...I appreciate that you guys are NOW trying to do the right thing, but let's stick to the facts, cause I could also show screenshots showing the software that Stephan downloaded unto my computer...FACTS...so let's just say that you guys are trying to do the right thing now and I appreciate it and leave it at that, but never try to make a customer look bad by making claims in response to their reviews that could be easily blown away with documentary proof."

I insert an ATT sim from my work phone and they try to tell me that my sim is not provisioned. If you want to break your devices and maybe compromise your data then use their service."

Update: So I know I've been cheated, as the company has sent an email saying I chose the wrong service. Considering I chose \"ANY Samsung, ANY  Country\", I would figure that was self explanatory. But not according to them. So give us ANOTHER $40, and it'll be ANOTHER 1-7 days on top of what we just gigged you for.

After that the next response I got was if I wanted to speak to someone I had to pay $2 (refundable of course - That was their words).  It is now 23 March and still no response to emails or Chats.  I will give it to the end of the month and if no response or I get what I paid for then the review will stay as a 1 Star not only on this site but every site I can access to include FB and all other Social Media.

First they couldn't unlock my iPhone so they suggested that I sned them my address and they will send me a UB SIM that would be coming from CA. After this I tried to contact support to get a tracking number to track this package. I specifically was in contact with Stephan. Support was very vague and rude to me. When I called him out on being rude he stopped answering my emails. So I had to go through the live chat again to get them to sedn me my tracking number. When i was able to track my package, it was coming from china and took about 2 weeks to get to me. I finally got my UB SIM. When I tried to unlock the phone with it, the menu had changed so I had to figure it out. The pictures and video they had were not very helpful; it needs to be updated. I believe I was able to figure it out, but now my iphone will call, iMessage, and use data, but will not let me text message. I messaged unlock boot support letting them know of my problem and once again the same support person answered me with a vague answer that does not fix my problem. I am a little frustrated because I have put money and time into this to get this phone unlocked and support has not been helpful at all. I really do not like to write bad review on people and I as support optimistic about unlock boot. At this point I feel like something needed to be said."

They did unlock my iphone, which is why I\u2019m even giving them stars to begin with, but I also waited around two weeks with nothing but a receipt email (the site stated that it would take about 5-7 business days). Thankfully, I paid with paypal because of my distrust after reading some mixed reviews, so I just opened a case to get my money back and immediately received an email saying that my phone was unlocked and to please close the paypal case. The whole thing wasn\u2019t great but at the end my phone did get unlocked. Side note: I took somedays after receiving the \u201cunlock phone\u201d email to take down the case because I\u2019ve been busy with work and they sent me a \u201cthreat\u201d(???) of locking my phone again if I didn\u2019t take it down. It\u2019s important to note, the cases close on their own if you don\u2019t say otherwise... I just didn\u2019t appreciate the attitude after I was waiting to use my phone waaay longer than expected. TL;DR: They do Unlock your phone, but you have to pressure them into doing so AFTER you\u2019ve payed."

He kept insisting that it was. I said no it's not I have a whole bunch of emails going back and forth. So the next morning I wrote him and said look, the phone does not work, it is not unlocked, he kept insisting that it was. So I called Verizon explain to them my situation of course I had to pay which I did until I told this guy that since you did spend time with me just refund me the $59 and you can keep the $29. He never would agree to that so I had to open up a dispute. Then you said I will disable your phone I said we'll go right ahead because it doesn't work and then I said again to go ahead and disable it and give me my money back because it doesn't work. Guess what never heard back from the guy he quit responding so now I've filed a claim with PayPal and my credit card company to get my money back.  I have been with PayPal since they have come out I am a seller on eBay with 100% positive. I would not scam somebody out of their money for there service,I'm not going to badmouth his company I'm just going to let the system work it out itself but I would hope that he would refund my money so I don't have to wait until 4 weeks to get my money back, going through PayPal system they want you to contact the other party and hopefully work it out but this guy refused to.With that being said I would use this product at your own risk\ud83d\ude3c"

          "Contenu": "June 25, 2019 Update: well I finally received a refund, 30 days after I was initially refused a refund. I got the refund after the company responded to the review shown below. It's notable the company did the right thing after all, but I do struggle to give them 3 stars because technically the overall experience was a time waster and I wound up returning the phone they later claimed they unlocked. Since I only had the phone for a few days, it appears someone else bought it from AT&T and probably had AT&T unlock it. I truly never did get the phone unlocked from UnlockBoot as they were trying to claim with Trustpilot. Before using their service I recommend reading the fine print on the policy page if you want to know what may happen if they can't unlock your phone on the first go around. For the record I have screen captures of their web site and lack of proper policy display the day I made my purchase, and I have screen captures and the text log of their totally rude agent Stephan. So just be aware they provide a valuable service that probably works as advertised most of the time, however when they make a guarantee, note that it is conditional and if you get Stephan as your agent, don't expect him to be helpful or polite.******Original Review: Absolute ripoff. They do not post anywhere in the checkout process that if the process does not work that they won't refund any of your money. In fact their pages say they guarantee they can unlock the phone. They don't guarantee anything. And none of the checkout pages spell out the no refund policy. Within 15 minutes of purchase I asked for my money back and they refused. Then the agent Stephan sent me the emoji with one finger. At no time did I say anything improper to warrant such offensive behavior. This is absurd. I hope PayPal will refund my money and simply not pay these crooks! UPDATED... Stephan refused to refund my money and now I see he has reported this review as SPAM. Totally dishonest. And now I read further down the bad reviews and others call the service a scam and they even refunded other people. Or said they did and never refunded them. So why refund others? I was told it is a no refund policy. The dude is rude.******June 22, 2019 Update... the seller never unlocked my phone and never refunded my money despite the fact that they buried the refund policy and the page I was on said they \"guarantee they could unlock my phone\". I returned the phone to the seller, someone else has purchased it, and they are now trying to tell me the phone unlocked and I should remove my review. Let's go over this one more time... the agent Stephan sent me the one finger emoji in my chat with him merely because I pointed out their lack of proper display to their refund policy and instead guaranteed satisfaction written on the page. They are insisting I remove this review review and trying to bully me. This is unacceptable and they should be fined for such aggressive and irrefutable business practices. If it wasn't $10 I'd sue them but it's not worth the time. I am however reporting them to the FTC."

I never received an email from them, and it had been like 10 minutes, so I checked the order status, and it told me they were going to do a remote fix and to download this and keep that open and I did. I waited a long time for the support to respond like 10 minutes. They told me I had to give them some info off the phone, so I did and then they said connect in 30 min. I waited 30 min and then waited another 5 or 10 min and the connected with me and then they were done. My SG 10+ is unlocked and works beautifully. Thank you for the fast service that was provided to me. I will be back cause I have another SG10+ to unlock as well and I will not be going anywhere but UnlockBoot."

They initiated the refund and as long as it as I actually receive it ill give them another star. I will say though that it was a bit rough going in the beginning since there was no communication for several hours but afterward the customer service was well and good.

With the reviews and recommendations from those that had been already served, i believe soon n very soon i will write my review again after the results are out. Mean while i recommend UnlockBoot for anyone having issues with any kind of locked phone as long as correct details are given to UnlockBoot technicians."

I ended up not getting a code until about 18 hours later, but when I got the code it did work. The customer service is fine but replies are really slow. I also asked about the difference between \"any model any service\" option multiple times before getting an answer. Apparently it's any OTHER model any OTHER service not specified and if there is your phone specified you need to choose that option. So all in all it worked and can't say I can complain too much since it worked, but just be careful about what you're picking."

PROS: iPhone Unlock WorkedChat Support Good price $$Ease of purchase (payment is able to be taken VIA a virtual card setup through Privacy.com)Easy website navigation (overall)CONS: Navigation on ACCOUNT section of website could use some improvementSupport can be somewhat unclear so always provide an email address so you can be emailed the chat transcriptsOVERALL: After going through the full process, I would use the service again and recommend it to friends.Thanks for reading"

I really recommend this site awesome technician they have fast servers and they work even on sundays . I used to download diffrent software tryed reading for hours and hours and days on internet youtube but most of its just scam/fake and i waisted my time alot with no results. So Iam very glad I found finally a GREAT SITE WITH GREAT TECHNICIAN WITH NICE PRICES to unlock phones. This site unlockboot is my current favorite site . Thanx again unlockboot for all the assitance and unlocking my phones. Have a beautiful day . Adrian / Europe"

It finally worked, but then I found out after my number was transferred that my phone what locked by AT&T. They wouldn't unlock it for 60 days, then they would. I was in a pinch, either I had to get service with atat again for 60 days, and pay for the company I switched to, or find a way to get my phone unlocked. I found unlockBoot. I was very skeptical at first and checked many different reviews and websites about them. I realize that many did not have good experience. After considering how much I would pay AT&T for two months if I went that route, I decided it try it, because it would be a fair amount cheaper and be and immediate fix vs going with AT&T. I did, and unlockboot had be a unlock code within an hour, I entered it in and it worked! My phone was then able to use the other sim card and I had service again! Thank you! I hope others will have the same experience I did. God Bless!"
