I say go to ZenBusiness at least they tell you all the fees upfront and technically better and much more affordable. Also, they don't respond to any emails at all. I'm still waiting on email responses that I sent over a week ago. When calling customer support none of the reps can answer your questions, it's also a major language barrier everyone is foreign, it's very difficult to understand their english."

The first issue I found is that a number of things priced are automatically double the actual cost listed, because in their fine print they say that there are 2 charges of the same exact amount that will happen for more than one service. Expect to pay more but get less value anticipated. The website builder they have looks cool, but so far is buggy and I can't get it to save my changes so I've wasted 30-40 minutes working on it so far and then having to go in and redo my work. I submitted a website ticket."

BUT here\u2019s the kicker. Right after the email I sent where I was discussing what I did not like specifically about them calling me immediately; they send me a survey request - it says on the email: \u201c  I was happy to see that you had a good experience with us :)\u201d are you serious? Does anyone know what\u2019s going on in that company? Outrageous pricing, bad customer service, no internal communications; completely just ridiculous to be honest. Do not use this company unless you want to be bombarded by them and never get a moment of peace. I asked them TWICE to remove me from all emails and they notified me they did and then they sent me an email AGAIN about my \u2018great experience\u2019. Thank you for saving me the hassle of emailing again. I hope others find this review helpful."

My biggest gripe is that I let them know that I didn't plan on doing business for a few months and was still convinced to sign up even though this costs me a minimum of $800 in tax liabilities for having an LLC one month (December) of the year. I found this out and called the company back in less than an hour. They said they would hold off sending in my application, but then I received a notification in the early AM that my application was sent in against my wishes. I would not recommend this company to a friend or an enemy. Look into doing this yourself and save lots of money."

          "Contenu": "COMPLETE SCAM / AVOID!Don't trust them to establish your LLC, they are a clever and complete scam on their website and especially on the phone.They'll call you straight after you start your application by \"helping\" you but they actually rip off your credit card without your consent. I've never experienced such a nasty scam before. Here's how to make it yourself for much cheaper:\"LLC\" registration: they're using another agent: Registered Agent Solutions Inc, it costs only 99$ if you do it directly with them. TB charges you 298$ for that... \"EIN\": you can do that online for free: IRS website (tailorbrands will just forward you an incomplete pre-filled PDF file, which you'll have to fax yourself anyway, and they'll make you pay 300$... just for the SS-4 form which you can download for free on IRS!!\"License guidance\"; completely useless, approx 99$\"Legal documents\" 119$ just a few Word file templates which you can get for free after 1min search online (service agreement, non-compete agreement, marketing agreement etc.)And still they'll try to sell you a tax compliant scheme for min 600$.So basically if you do it yourself it might cost around 99$. They charged me 800+ and I'm so upset getting scammed by them."

They refunded the cost as a gesture which didn\u2019t solve my problem.

          "Contenu": "I hired them to set up to register a business for me and they happily took money of $299.  I paid for the expedited process and then after two weeks of not hearing from Tailorbrands, I began to ask what was going on.  I was told oh, \"It's in process\" on several calls and emails.  After two more weeks, I broke down and called the state to find out what the problem was.  The state had actually denied my application before I ever called Tailorbrands the first time to find out what the hold-up was.  I ended up spending several hours writing emails, waiting on hold, speaking with representatives, being told someone would call me back, and when they did call me back they said that someone else was looking into the matter for me and would call me... I never received a call back explanation, it was always pass the hot potato.  Now that I had called the state and found out my name was too close to my previous business name I knew why there was a hold up.  It actually took them a while to figure it out and it wasn't until I started asking for a refund did they bother to come up with an excuse to state some policy that they cannot give me my money back.  No one in their customer service department has any authority to work with the customers, and their managers must have been instructed to not work with the customers and to delay or pass off any responsibility to billing which has no number per the managers.  The real kicker for me was when I was told \"I want to make sure that your concern is taken care of, so I've sent your email to our relevant team for a closer look and they'll be in touch with you soon to help you out.\"  What the Heck-Fire is a \"Relevant Team\"?  Let that sink in.If your business set up has any complications getting set up, Good Luck."

          "Contenu": "I rarely write reviews, but when I do, it is usually when I am extremely pleased with the services. However, this time I feel the need to warn people so that they don't encounter the same problem I did. Tailor Brands is a company that makes many promises and uses a lot of words, but when it comes to taking action, they respond with the statement 'we are not able to give you legal advice.' Essentially, they become unresponsive when you need help. However, they will persistently call you to sell you additional products that they claim you absolutely need. It is important to note that their prices are competitive. So, when you see their appealing price of only $300 for opening your LLC, be prepared to add another $400 to it. I have requested a full refund because they charged me for providing help with obtaining my EIN number, but no one actually assisted me. As a result, it is impossible for me to have an LLC without an EIN. On top of all this, it has been over a month, and I have been patient. This is a scam! Additionally, when paying for their services, be cautious of discounted prices. You will ultimately be charged the full price. For example, when I purchased the EIN service, which was supposed to cost $50, I was surprised to be charged $100."

Please, do yourself a favor and just look into taxes on your own and file for your own LLC and business banking. Their options are limited, did not meet my needs and the third-party tax assistance is ridiculous. I have already had to pay late fees multiple times because I was not aware that I would have to file monthly. I am now figuring it out on my own and wish SINCERELY that I had not spent all this money on this CRAP. The steps are as follows:1. Find information about taxes both local, state, and federal (speak with your local SBA they can assist). 2. File for your LLC or sole proprietorship (there are many online options like Legal Zoom)3. Find a domain name and hosting package you like. Make it simple if you are a retailer and go with shopify from the start. 4. If you want branded stuff or need to design your logo etc. Go with Canva. Overall, your cost will be MUCH lower and your results MUCH higher."

I notified them and they told me I did have an account and told me with instructions how to cancel. Again, there was no \"cancel\" button shown since the account wasn't active.

We asked for a confirmation email and never received it. We asked for a cancellation notice and never received it, but we were told that there was nothing else we needed to do. Yesterday they charged us three separate transactions against our consent. When we call to dispute it and ask them why their solution was to give us back 50% of the money that they took without permission.

The form did not allow me to use a 3rd party agent, which I intended to do, because it is cheaper than paying Tailor Brands to do it ($49/year versus $199/year from Tailor). After I submitted everything, I was then charged an extra $99 for the EIN... Which I was under the impression that I had already paid this. I would not have moved forward if I had known this $99 was going to be tacked on after I paid.Finally, the LLC has been formed and as I'm going through the operating agreement, I see it's a generic template with NONE of my actual information put into it. What a joke.You're better off taking the time to do this yourself or go with a company that's not going to bait-and-switch you."

For example, you can\u2019t call customer support and speak to someone, you have to write them an email and wait for someone to get back to you. Don\u2019t even get me started on the \u201cverification process\u201d when doing so. It feels very tedious and not catered to the client."

However, if they weren't sneaky and used expedited filing as it seemed to be worded when I bought it, I wouldn't be here leaving this review. My guess is that the \"Expedited filing\" was just through Tailor Brands side, and basic filing through state.After this review, they agreed to give me the expedited filing refund. They are quick with customer service on that aspect. But this shouldn't need to go this far to get a refund with this reasoning, adding an extra star because I stand by my opinion but thank them for refunding and hope they make a change to that expedited filing section."

I declined. The next day, I woke up with a $660 charge on my card for the annual subscription, and not even the cheapest plan.I sent them 4 emails, and every response was either something like \"I will forward this to [xxx] department, but are you sure you don't want it?\" or \"I understand your frustration, having a business is hard. We don't do refunds for your purchases but in this case we can offer store credit\".After writing this review, the company finally issued me the refund, so I edited from 1 to 2 stars. I am still leaving this review because I firmly believe that this compulsory charging is how they operate, and I find it unacceptable. I'm sure some people end up accepting the service instead of complaining. The only reason they accepted to refund me was due to this review, which should have not been necessary on the first place."

The worst part of the experience was the difficulty I had to go through to get a refund of money for a service that although it wasn't cancelled before the due date, it was one day after AND it was for a mailbox that was inaccessible anyone. The plan subscription was cancelled timely, the domain expired therefore a refund for the mailbox should be automatic. As a new online business owner I have learned to be more careful jumping into service agreements especially for yearly subscriptions. Tailor Brands is in the business of making money, just as I am but you need to be clearer and more upfront about your cancellation and refund policies. Your reviews are terrible regarding these issues. Thanks for the experience. I've learned better and I'll be more cautious moving forward in my decision making.Yulisa Benitez (Tailor Brands)Jul 11, 2023, 19:44 GMT+3Hi Angie,Thank you for your reply, this is Yulisa from the LLC team. Normally, when someone buys a Business Mailbox from us, it can't be refunded. But, it's great that you reached out to us so quickly because we can cancel Mailboxes up to 5 days after they were purchased.  I see that that is the case here, so I can cancel the purchase for you and apply store credit to your Tailor Brands account with the amount you paid.  You can then purchase a new Mailbox or a different service from us using this credit. Just let me know as soon as possible if you'd like me to proceed with the cancellation.  I'm here to make things as easy and stress-free as possible for you!Best,YulisaTailor Brands Solutions TeamTailorbrands.com"

It is unnecessarily hard to set up a basic landing page and you are better to just get hosting with GoDaddy or another company and hire someone from Fiverr to set up a landing page. The business deck templates that are supposedly branded often use weird versions of your logo. And you only get one choice of deck presentation while I feel you should get at least 5. You cannot use your own domain for your business email which makes no sense. I bought my domain elsewhere before I created the logo with Tailor Brands. So I can't use their business email. I basically paid $50 just for the logo when I could have paid $33."

We couldn't fix it because the program would not correct it and there was no one to actually speak to at tailor brands to correct the mistake. This was why we gave the company 2 stars. It is very hard to reach a human at this company. Chat is a bot that cannot deal with any specifics. No person. I also had a billing issue and could not get in touch with any humans. Very bad business practice. If you offer a service, especially in customizations, customers should be able to speak to someone if they need help."

Then, within a matter of hours I was charged an ADDITIONAL $61.89! I didn\u2019t sign up for anything. I reached out to the company and got 2 responses that it was my fault for \"upgrading\" thats why I was charged more money.  Computers can be weird so I thought sure, maybe it was me. So I went back through the checkout process, twice, to see where I went wrong and to find the \"Upgrade\" option. That didn't exist. I emailed back and forth to finally get someone to agree to refund my money that was blindly tacked onto my order. The other weird thing was, the next day, my banks fraud department called me to ask if I placed that charge.. I explained the situation and they said they would watch it for a few days to see if I got the refund. They refunded me... $0.43 and my bank confirmed there was no further initiated refund. So we did what we had to do. Hope your experience is better than mine!Update 1/6/20: Thanks for your reply, Tailor Brands. I did email you back quite a few times, not sure why you said I didn\u2019t. You also said you\u2019d refund my money and you sent me a refund invoice for $0.43.. not $61.89. Looking forward to your reply."

You cannot move on without \"accepting\" the design and then you can't make changes.   Image creation requires a subscription, which is essentially your actual fee for your image, since you are paying them for a non-service.  This allows them to market on legal websites as a free service add on when you're creating your company.   Since the subscription isn't your image fee, you don't get anything for free.  The (free) image fee is like $3 and the subscription is $40+   Documentation states that you can cancel at any time if you are no longer interested in the service, but my experience was very different.  From all appearances, they just sat and waited and hoped that you don't cancel your subscription. They will automatically renew you after your service term with no warning and they will not refund.   $80 a pop for an automated design...not good value.  If you get this referred to you as a free product from somewhere else, BEWARE.....  (****DID ISSUE REFUND AFTER NEGATIVE REVIEW****)****UPDATE****  After writing the negative review above, which I have also voluntarily softened, I was refunded my renewal money in full and offered a full year of service free of charge, so in the end, Tailor did make things right, and they did so politely and without placing any customer-facing blame (which is credit-worthy and difficult to do!!!).  It earned them another star, but it shouldn't have to be that way.   I do not intend to use the free service, as I would be holding them hostage.  Done is done."

I also told them I had cancelled my subscription and asked if they terminate my account could I get a refund instead of having access for a year.Their support team told me that it's a subscription service and gave steps on how to cancel which I had already told them I had done. So I reiterated that I wanted a refund and that my subscription had been cancelled.A day went by with no reply, so I send a follow-up email the next morning and they respond offering me a 50% refund. I don\u2019t see why a full refund would be an issue, they just state \u201cUnderstand that we show the subscription nature of our site at all times\u201d. Yes, I knew it was a subscription I was just asking for a refund as I\u2019m in a difficult place and would have cancelled if I knew the \u00a3190 was about to be taken from my account without warning.The customer service is like pulling teeth, slow and painful. The product itself isn\u2019t bad but nothing special.  But the company seems to just use this subscription service to profit off unexpected customers as a lot of other reviews on here state.UPDATE:They've come back to me and given me a full refund which I'm happy about.

Why they advertise on youtube that getting set up with tailor brands is faster than making an omlette is beyond me needless to say that is not the case. I must admit I did get buyers remorse mostly because of the reviews i saw online and their false advertisment.  6 hours later, I emailed tailor brands to cancelled everything and naturally i asked for a refund. After two 30 minute on the phone, several emails which included 3 different reps denying my refund i finally got it.. I figured if its this frustrating getting a refund i cant imagine their customer service. Tailor brands i hope you are reading this and know that training your reps to lie to customers who experience buyers remorse into bullying them to stay with your services is wrong. Do better."

Signed up with Tailor Brands, paid the $7.99 knowing it was a subscription and I\u2019d cancel it the next month after the opening month charge and if I forgot I\u2019d be out $20 total ($9.99 a month) the next month. Well, 15 months and $150 later found out they don\u2019t notify you via email like every other major subscription service (Netflix, HBO, ISP\u2019s, etc). So you continue to get charged and don\u2019t know.  According to their customer service they notify you in the notification center within the website only. They don\u2019t send you anything after you sign up and just wait for you to figure it out. Tried multiple times with them to get any type of partial refund and NO is all they say. The email I signed up with didn\u2019t have a login and their password reset link didn\u2019t work so I didn\u2019t even have access to the notification Center where I was supposedly told I was still paying for the subscription. When I asked to cancel the subscription, they didn\u2019t. Had to talk to another person who finally cancelled it and then told me the opposite and said they do send emails to the members direct email but when I told them I never received any such emails was still told no. Do not work with this company. They bank on people forgetting it\u2019s a subscription and make it difficult for you to be aware you\u2019re even being charged. The way it was handled makes me believe this is how they operate purposely. Look on other review sites. I\u2019m not the only one. Once they get in, they want to keep their charges under the radar til, like me, years have gone by.Update\u2026.., they\u2019ve refunded my money only since I submitted this review. Unfortunate it had to come to this but they assured me there are emails on subscription renewal sent to your main email."

I\u2019ve raised my rating from 1 to an 3, I want to say 4 but\u2026That said I do believe they need to make the expediting process more clear. When they say do it in 4-5 business days they mean that they will submit it in that time, versus them taking 4 weeks to submit the form you already filled out and could very easily submit yourself in less time , this is still the main reason that one star is missing because it literally makes zero sense. The reply team should also be more attentive and pay attention to what is written to them. * originalThe responses are automated and ignore anything you write. The page is unclear and misleading, you WILL be overcharged and for things that are  redundant. They will then ask you to review or ask how service was then ignore you. My review went from 6 to 1 after the service was rendered because of the customer support team being ridiculous and ignoring everything I asked or said. If they actually listened it would be a great company and service but it is just a robotic reply machine."

Found this page that promised a free logo. When logo was designed, you cannot do anything without subscribing. I decided I would subscribe - you need to sign up for a full year. I did under the promise of an upgrade making it possible to download the logo for printing. Once I paid, i found that only low res download was available unless I upgraded to an even more expensive sub, which would allow me to download the vector graphic file that I needed. Total hoax."

One thing I would like to complain about your service.1, It is difficult to modify as I like it from your design sample I choose, to the amateur like me. For example, if I want to change square angle to the round, no idea how to simply change it and also to change the colors, confused.2, payment, it is better to the one time user if you prepare the payment system for one initial design how much, peoples will hesitate to pay monthly base. I will choose to buy one design base if it is slightly expensive. 3, Especially, it is good and simple to choose initial design what I want from your AI idea but it is complicated how to buy it immediately and modify it as I like.  That is my opinion~~~ Regards."

The correct design is under a monthly subscription and I would like if this was considered for the paid annual subscription instead of the wrong one.2. I had my card deducted for this month without any notification. If we users could easily find a place in our accounts to cancel our subscriptions it would be great. 3.

Finally someone said they will only refund 50% of the $60 I was charged. They need to have a courtesy email to tell people the subscription is about to renew because clearly this happens a lot. Or at least have it expire and remind people to renew if they want to. After going back and forth a few times they decided to refund the entire amount. I\u2019m satisfied with this and hopefully they can adjust their policies to stop having angry customers in the first place.  Thanks for the refund."

So i should pay $200 dollars for a service i do not want.Honestly, I'm very disgusted by companies without morals and conscience. This is one company i think you should avoid.***update I was offered a 50% refund, which i accepted. Customer service was quick and did their best to assist. I would only recommend to the company that transparency builds trust. It is better to inform your customers of upcoming obligations,   if you have a good product they will stay.

Yes, I sent the appropriate email to customer support (which warns you that if you send more than one you get bumped to the end of the line every time) but waiting up to 48 hours for a simple answer of \"You can't do that.\" or \"Oh, go here!\" is truly peeving me.  A serious lack of customer support.  For a company that has the computer generate the logo selection and requires minimal staffing, Tailor brands could add the human element into the experience by having a phone number for guidance.  The support pages are not very clear on editing your purchased logo and from other reviews I am reading now it seems I am not the only one who has experienced this."

It felt very misleading that info on subscriptions was not disclosed on any of the web pages that I was utilizing to choose the logo design.I think if they offer the logo ONLY option that their reviews will improve.  They do not need to trick people into a subscription.  I am sure there are lots of people that will want and appreciate the subscription option.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I paid $29.99 for a single set of logo files on June 18, 2019 with Paypal.Today, July 18, I got notification from Pay Pal that Taylor Brands has charged me another, $39.99 that t I did not agree to, did not want. Of course there is no phone number on their website.There is not even a way to log in to delete an account that I do not have in the first place.I sent an email to Tailor Brands and have disputed the charge with Paypal.original [DO NOT TRUST THIS WEBSITE OR COMPANY.]"

I'd prefer to have an option to by the one logo I wanted to create. Even if it was a higher price. I am a developer and the fact that I \"accidentally\" signed up fir the upgrade should show you how risky this is. Definitely am canceling my subscription as soon as my client is work is done. I initially really enjoyed the product. I bought the one month subscription. Showed my client the logo and asked for a tagline to be included. So went to edit it and add a tag line. I was able to add one but not change the text. So I was looking into creating another one. The page continued to redirect me out of my account to create (and buy) a new one. I wasn't a fan of that. So I looked at my plan to see if upgrading it would allow me to change a simple tagline font...Then I saw I had a 12 month subscription. I looked at my account and saw that after my $9.99 was charged. There was a $38 charge on my bank account the moment after I was charged $9. This is unacceptable. Had I not had client feed back I don't think I would have noticed the additional charge."

I follow their \"Help Center\" which tells me to change a few things in the DNS Domain settings. Then, it tells you to contact Tailor Brands Support, which I did...repeatedly, and they don't do anything other than ask what I need help with.   I also sent pictures of the steps I taken. When you go to publish your website it asks for your url/domain, which I put in, and it says it's a licensed site(my site). Then, it publishes the website using an irrelevant url anyway.    Hard to reinforce my branding, make my website easier to recall, or convey what the website is all about if the url doesn't make sense. They keep telling me to repeat things and say that their FAQ is wrong. In the end, I have to forward with masking which didn't make sense, considering how pointless their Step-By-Step guide is that makes you \"Select\" your domain, then forwarding to your \"free\" website domain. Why am I paying for a domain when they make your website publish/connect to a free alternative?  They tell you to change some CNAME and A settings that point to the heroko design website. When I type in my domain, it brings me there. This is telling me I should be able to connect my actual website, but Tailor Brands is avoiding the issue. Update: They tell me more things to do that I already tried. My domain is useless since publishing to it doesn't do anything. I don't want to mask since it makes the site look less transparent. Oh well, at least the customer service is nice about it and \"seem\" to be making an effort.Updated Conclusion: Customer Service is decent and the services are okay, but the outcome isn't as expected."

I\u2019ve been a chat agent before so I can\u2019t blame the service but I\u2019m disappointed in this company as it was highly reviewed. The fees were not laid out in an easy to understand manner and I feel scammed. I worked hard for my money.. I\u2019m heartbroken.Edited to add: The company reached out immediately so I have moved the rating from 3 to 4 stars. The only reason it\u2019s not a 5 is because of the hassle for a refund however I do think if you have the budget this is a good service. Just read everything CAREFULLY and know what you need for your LLC"

On the same day, I responded to the email, explicitly expressing my non-authorization for the renewal and reiterating my request for cancellation. Contrary to the information provided in their email, my credit card statement indicates a deduction of $170.99 on the 14th.Subsequently, I sent another email with supporting evidence, highlighting the unethical nature of their practices, and requested a refund along with the immediate cancellation of my subscription, as previously communicated.
