          "Contenu": "The initial rental experience of booking and confirming through Rentcars was good, easy to use and quick. After that the experience got rapidly less pleasant. The company that they used to supply the cars was definitely not one shown on their website. The quality of the car we rented was terrible. And the service from them worse. Trying to contact Rentcars and get help from them is difficult, only emails and very slow. But the response when you got it was always the same - not our problem. The final straw and why I would suggest never using Rentcars is that the rental company has withheld my deposit. Rentcars says the company has 30 working days to return it and even when that has passed the deposit has not been returned and no help from Rentcars. Rentcars use sub contractors. They advertise the big names on their website but when you boom it\u2019s with the least reputable companies out there."

Even 24hrs prior to the booking they sent me a confirmation email reminding me how my reservation was all green to go, whereas, the rental company had never accepted it.So we were left with my five daughters aged 1 to 10 with no car and no way of getting a taxi legally from the airport as they are not allowed to let more than 6 passengers into a taxi (officially, and the airport needs to be squeaky clean) - the reason I was hiring a 7 seater in the first place."

While booking they said that they do not rent to Florida residents and I should have a return flight ticket. I was fine with both conditions. When I went to rent, they tell me that my return flight ticket has to be on the same day as their return of car...that was never mentioned. My return was on 11/19/23 as I did not need the car from 11/18-11/19/2023. Bocuse of this they refused to rent me the car. Left me stranded in Orlando with no car at 11:30 PM in an unsafe area outside their rental office. I had to get a Lyft to get out of this unsafe place. The staff were very uncooperative and inconsiderate even though it was their unclear policy that left me stranded!Never rent them...they will try to get you some way or other!"

Be ready to pay extra for vacuum cleaning, exorbitant amount for gas etc. 4. The rental car unit is 12 mins away from all airports and shuttle only comes every 30 mins. So long wait time. 5. Poor customer service. When we argued with the salesperson about our dispute and asked for manager, we were informed that manager is busy and cannot attend to our complaints. Bottom line - save yourself some money and hassle and do not go for this car rental company. Its only purpose is to rip off people."

After we could chat with a real person, they blamed us that we did not pick up the car before10:00AM, though we have informed about our flight arrival time and we asked in advanced whether this is a problem. They had told us there is no problem since there is a 24h service at the airport. But they didn't inform the car rental company. Furthermore, the most flights arrive after 10AM, so how can anybody be sure to get a car? We had a lot of trouble and pain until we could get a overpriced  replacement  car at about 03:00AM next day from another car rental company. rentcars has not refunded our payment despite several requests and of course denies any compensation for the additional costs we had due to their mistakes."

I booked unlimited mileage and it was confirmed on the bill. When I went to pick up the car, they told me: 300 km/day maximum for Ontario and Quebec licensed drivers (information they hid with lots of care). Another lie: the famous Ottawa airport pick up! Not to mention the unreasonable amount asked for the credit card. Another customer was in the exact same situation as me. We both cancelled our reservation on the spot because it clearly had a scammy flavour. The whole experience was very upsetting and uncomfortable. Employees are unprofessional and useless perhaps because they are busy milking people's money. Not going back there FOR SURE. Stay away / stay safe folks! I am waiting for my reimbursement and please don't send your useless automatic message that you are sorry and that we need to contact your so called customer service."

We had to pay extra to add an additional driver and use another card!Secondly, the pick up description on the voucher was completely different from the real shuttle pick up location, making us walk back an forth with heavy luggage an calling Centauro several times.

The rental company made us pay for an all-in insurance which was mandatory for this kind of car. This almost doubled the initial price stated by Rentcars.

Luckily I was able to log in to my insurance comp website via my cell phone and pull up the entire policy, I had a $1,000 Deductible so they were going to charge more $$ to cover the Deductible OR instead of the normal $500 they automatically charge your card, refundable when returned undamaged, they would charge my card $1,000.  So I chose the $1,000 option with no extra insurance payment from them.  The couple next to me, I felt so aweful for. They booked their rental using and AMEX card without issue, but then there at the counter, they also had to pay the refundable deposit but they told them they don't accept AMEX and they didn't have another card.  Not sure what happened to them.The lady at the counter was very rude when I was trying to explain what the Routes website said to bring and how it differed now at the counter. She pulled out a booklet and said you can read this, it is in the fine print. I said that those rules are different than the rules I was given when booking.  She walked away, muttering something in Spanish, leaving my Credit Card & Drivers license sitting on the desk.This is an off site car rental company - the instructions on how to get to the Shuttle are long and challenging. Be prepared to stop multiple times on your \"Journey\" to find where you actually need to get to.  My opinion, use another company."

          "Contenu": "I will personally avoid this company in future and go direct instead due to the difficulties in reaching customer service and the way their insurance is organised.If there is a problem, Customer service is mostly automated through bots. It is very difficult to actually talk to a person. To give you an idea of how difficult it was to talk to someone, we tired the WhatsApp number to contact them at 9:38. We eventually received a response at 12:32. Almost 3 hours later.As an overview of what happened, We paid for total insurance, but they didn\u2019t communicate this to the rental agency as the insurance is separate. So to the local agency we only had basic insurance, so if there was a problem, we would be charged by the rental agency then have to claim with Rentcars.com.  After taking a ridiculous amount of time to talk with someone to understand how the insurance worked, we decided that given the difficulty in talking to them, we didn\u2019t want to risk dealing through them, so wanted to cancel, which turned out more difficult than we expected.  We eventually managed to resolve this over the phone, but they initially only cancelled the extra insurance and required another call to get the car refunded.  I have dealt with equivalent aggregate car rental companies in Europe and Australasia, where the rental and insurance is all integrated and it was always reasonably able to be reached if needed. CarRentals.com needs to evolve to be competitive."

Please!Edit : Concerning rentcars.com response : as I said previously, there's absolutely nowhere on the website where I can contact you directly.Once again, how do I get in contact with you?Last edit : finally got a partial refund more than 5 weeks later.I cannot rate higher as this was an extremely frustrating experience.Please make your support easier to contact without having to use trustpilot as a contact form."

This info was not available online as I was deciding whoch company to choose.  1.  although I had selected additional driver,  it was not o  the agreement and the renter cost is $20/day to add a driver.  2.  This renter, YORK, has very detailed policy requirements regarding insurance coverage - must be comprehensive, must name each driver, must show them the policy where rental car is listed as included on the policy- and not sure who walks around with their entire policy. I had to call home and have the policy sent page by page.  This delayed my by about an hour.  3.  policies about returning the car clean to avoid $300 cleaning charge and 5.  penalty of $50 for driving on a toll road in addition to paying the toll fee and taxes.    The customer service person was great and answered my questions about these policies, but it was all done at the counter, and I would have appreciated the opportunity to consider these additional costs and penalties prior to selecting the rental company."

The problems are the rentalcover insurance that is useless because no rental company acknowledge it as a valid insurance, and you always have to pay the rental insurance of the rental company or to make a security deposit of thousands of euros (which often is problematic). And another issue is that it's impossible to change something on your reservation, like to extend it, or change the pickup time, or anything else. Another issue is related to the categories shown on the app, which leaves a wide margin to interpretation. For instance: I've made a reservation for a Peugeot 2008 because I needed a big car, but the insurance company gave me a Dacia Sandero instead, claiming they were the same category. The day an SUV is the same category as an economy vehicle it's going to be tragic. It should be clear which cars belong to each category, otherwise it's just plain cheating. I don't know about other platforms, but this is an average service."

Hence they would not provide me the vehicle, unless additional CDW and theft protection is purchased at the spot.As I was in a rush I had no choice but to pay extra for the additional options so I could pick up the vehicle.This creates an unnecessary hassle and additional cost for me as it just appears that the original coverage is somewhat irrelevant if a customer is in such situation, given the vehicle is at their possession, not mine.Most importantly, the price that Rentcars provided was absolutely incorrect because that is NOT going to allow to pick up your car, unless paying extra as demanded by the rental company.Have reported the case since end of August and still have not received any constructive feedback as to date. Would rather book via other agencies instead.Update as of Oct 26th: Problem resolved after numerous attempts to reach out to the team (even an escalation email to the CEO). Long story short, the excessive amount that I paid for was refunded at last. Thanks Pamela for the help. My opinion remains unchanged that the quotation provided by the company is not accurate. Believe that's something the company should consider including going forward."

I don\u2019t think there is but because it was so cheap I went ahead and will get the bus from T2 to T1 and then the shuttle bus."

However when we returned from our 2-week holiday I contacted the amazing customer service at Rentcars just in case: After they checked with Keddy to confirm that we didn't pick up the car they sent me a full refund for the booking! In retrospect I should have contacted Rentcars when I arrived late to Mexico, rather than trying to reach Keddy. I'm sure they'd have sorted it out somehow!"

Initially I had difficulty receiving support because other than a chatbot, I wasn't able to find a way to contact support, which was a bit frustrating. However, upon leaving a review on this site, I was contacted right away by a representative and they helped me sort out the problem, thankfully. They even asked me about my experience with the chatbot because they want to make sure it's working properly. Because of the good support that I eventually received, I'll definitely consider Rentcars again as an option for finding a good deal on a car."
