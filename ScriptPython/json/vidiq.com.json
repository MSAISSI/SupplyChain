I've tried to cancel them multiple times, reached to the support, though support chat shows usually available in few hours. Who is going to wait for it?! I waited on 3rd or 4th time and before cancelling they were asking ton of questions, why I decide to cancel, can they keep me and etc. When I said I just want to chargeback, support team said I was rude to them, and they won't tolerate such language. what?!!? Anyways, I am a customer of multiple month to month subscription, and everywhere it is easy to cancel, just by clicking cancel button. Anyways, I've done chargeback to cancel my subscription. Be careful subscribing to this service."

As an EU Consumer, I\u2019m legally protected by the consumer rights act which gives a 14-day refund period on all digital products. Not only did VidIQ not honour this (which is a legal requirement for sales made within the EU) but they completely ignored the message. I will be filing a Dispute with my bank, as well as warning people of this fraudulent \u2014 Update, they have now agreed to refund the unused days (considering I only logged in once in 60-days, this is still very bad practice) and I will be pursuing this further."

I'm actually on the telephone with my bank to report Vidiq and ensure my account is credited back with \u00a343.87.  Do not use Vidiq, I repeat, stay away from the website, they don't even have anything on the website that will allow you to reach them for help.  No telephone number, no email, no support whatsoever.  Bunch of thieves, reaping where did not sow.  For this amount, Vidiq will cough it out as I m not done with Vidiq yet.  This is just the beginning."

          "Contenu": "VidIQ is so beneficial in so many aspects. Helping creators grow their channels, understand the methods & goals of content creation, adding tags to videos, etc. However, the biggest problem with vidIQ is their AI system. Not every type of content creation genre has the same style for their titles. I create Roblox videos, not commentary videos. So, why is the AI giving me titles that commentary channels create? The titles don\u2019t recommend Roblox content creation styled titles. This implies for their description too. I don\u2019t use the AI thumbnails feature as I have my own thumbnail designer, but this is a huge letdown to be honest and it makes it really hard to work with the AI feature. Hope they improve it."

Seems you pay more money to become part of a large community so not good value for money so back to basic plan without refund!UPDATE:  Having written this review I was contacted by VIDIQ via email who offered their apolygies for the experience I had encountered and by way of making ammends have completly reunded by cost of the Max subscription and also given me access to 3 months on the Pro account free of charge.  As a result of this offer, I can only review my inital points and change it accordingly."

Edward noticed that I still had my Pro account running and that was why I had been charged for this also. He cancelled my Pro account for me and took the charge for that account and credited it against my upgraded Boost account! He then asked if I wanted him to apply a 50% discount for the next six months, of course I said yes! A great company and a great product that has really helped me with my YouTube channel. Edward done amazing! Will be screenshotting this conversation to show folk what amazing customer service actually looks like! A credit to a great company."
