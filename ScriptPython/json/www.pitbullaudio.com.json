Open it up and the cd mechanism was loose. Called Tascam and they said they don\u2019t sell B stock items or even sell anything like this. Yet Pitbull claims they are from Tascam, hmmm I wonder who\u2019s lying? These were boxes of players in a pallet more than likely that got dropped or some violent mishap. They probably got it from insurance write off after sales. F you Jew"

          "Contenu": "I purchased a Roland AE 20 from Pitbull Audio website in late August.After I received the instrument, I watched all the online tutorial videos and used Roland AE Lesson app on my phone to confirm that I am using the right fingering.  But the instrument is stubbornly off pitch, e.g. when I pressed the keys for E4 and F4, my tuner shows the sound from the instrument is B5 and C5 respectively.   At the same time other keys are fine with the right sound pitch.I contacted Pitbull Audio customer service, they told me to contact Roland directly;  I tried to contact Roland, but there is no phone call or live chat support available;  I tried to set up a video call support session, it was cancelled with no reason.So I paid ~$1000, and now end up with an off pitch instrument in my hand.  Very frustrated and disappointed.The only lesson I learned is not to buy on line from now on; If it's a local store, I can at least drive to the store to ask."

A month later and all I have back is multiple rude messages off a lady named Frances, now I'm getting no reply at all and I still don't have my money back even though FedEx ha e authorised and informed the claim has been processed to Pit bull.

Manager AJ told me it was my fault for not being home at 10 on a weekday and told me he would fix it with FedEx. FedEx said they had no record of any changes to the account and said the guitar would be shipped back. I ordered this on 12/10 and on 12/18 we were told it was being shipped back. This was a Christmas gift and now we were left with no guitar and a canceled order. I feel we were misled by staff members several times and AJ said that everyone else was wrong about the situation and he was correct. He would not acknowledge mistakes that his staff had acknowledged and told me that things had been taken care of when they had not been. Very poor choices and very poor service."

          "Contenu": "I bought a Gemini speaker from Pitbull audio, it was delivered on November 3. I used it on November 6, it seemed to work fine during the sound check. I did not need it again until December 4, which would be its second time in use. During the sound check, it was easily discerned that there was no high end coming from the unit. Apparently either the horn or the crossover had blown. As this speaker was rated 2000 W, well above the ratings of my other speakers, I do not believe there was too much signal fed to it. I contacted pitbull audio on December 5, they told me I had no choice but to go to the manufacturer, as it was beyond their 30 day return policy. Gemini will accept it back for repair, but only if I pay shipping. In the meantime, I will have to buy another speaker, as I cannot wait for this one to be repaired, and then pay for shipping to repair a speaker that I will no longer need. As a struggling musician who has had half of his 2020 gigs canceled this year, I am very disappointed that neither the vendor nor the manufacturer is willing to help. My advice is to not buy Gemini, nor to buy from Pitbull audio."

Neck had no relief at all/lot of back bow and the lower strings were in contact with the fretboard just sitting there. I called and was told to call back in few days when tech who supposedly did setup would be there. Guitar was driving me crazy just sitting there, plus wasn't keen on the idea of having to ship it back for repair, so decide to spend those few days working on it. After MANY hours of adding relief, letting neck relax and then continuing to adjust the guitar is functional now. Still not great, so may have to contact ESP about the issue. Really wish experience could have been more positive."

Then after the purchase I was informed the (factory new) guitar was broken and had to be sent back to the factory. They shipped it back and the manufacturer repaired it- finally it shipped a month later. I have bought from PB before, and I believe I just got the wrong salesperson. Did they have what I wanted? Yes - did I get a good price? Yes, but it was overall a miserable experience and there are many others looking for business in this climate that know what\u2019s up."

The Pit Bull people were great; answered the phone and e-mails, fast shipping, no issue there.The fit and finish on this guitar is top notch, especially at that price point. The neck is rolled more than I\u2019ve seen a production guitar before, making it super smooth to play. The C shape is swallow which also helps out. The hardware is very good, no issues there at all.The issue is the electronics. The volume pot had the wrong capacitor attached to it, it no longer had the audio taper; setting 1 was the same volume as 10. Also, the pots and the selector switch were a little noisy from dust. When you move the selector switch from position 4 to 5 a very loud CLACK came outta the amp. After I repaired those issues (new pots and a new selector switch) the pickups were a bit weak for my taste, I changed them out to Seymour Duncan\u2019s. Now it\u2019s a kick ass guitar all the way around.Was it worth the money? Yes, at a little less than a $1000 (after the repairs and modifications) it plays and sounds way better than a Fender Professional Stratocaster which costs hundreds more. And, I have a Larry Carlton guitar."

But it couldn't have been because I was chatting with someone at Pitbull when i bought it and was told it was in stock.  They managed to get it to me in time but if i hadn't called i would have most likely been waiting a very long time.So that transaction brings my rating to 4 stars."

          "Contenu": "While my stay in the Gem&Mineral show in Tucson this year I finally decided to fullfill my dream of a 12string guitar and found the Godin A12 on the Pittbull Audio website. I sent an offer of 750$ instead of 799$, which was accepted with the offer of an additional hardcase, if I would pay $ 799.As I had to take the guitar on 3 different flights back home to Germany I was happy to get the case instead of the gigbag the A12 comes with originally.Guitar arrived within a few days and I am still happy with it. The case seemed to be a problem as they didn't find any where the A12 fitted in and finally decided to order the original Godin hardshellcase in Canada and I would be informed about the tracking number... After a week or so I asked by mail what happened to the case as I never received a tracking number. \"I'll check status now\" was all I got for another few days. And then the day of my departure arrived and so I sent another mail to all the Pittbull contacts I had so far asking what happened in the end with my case and if they will credit the difference of 49 $. All I got was an forwarded mail from one guy to another as my address was in the header as well asking if he has any info about the case. Till today nobody apologized about anything but (!) the 49 $ arrived on my creditcard account and the A12 arrived with me in perfect condition in Cologne, even if United urged me on one flight to let them carry the guitar with other dropped off carry-on's. So in the end - all fine - but very poor comunication!!!"

The 5.8 will go out tomorrow on a corporate show for City of Houston on a large stage with the mayor and Congress members in attendance and I have no doubt will be a critical part of my performance. Peace of mind. Guarantee my next purchase will be from Pitbull audio. Thanks so much, Mike."

I ordered it and noticed afterward when I went back to check the description again, it showed out of stock. I called to make sure I hadn\u2019t missed that and was told the order would be fulfilled. While I was on the phone, without asking, the rep went back to the warehouse and checked the slot to put his eyes product. He confirmed I bought the last one. I thought that was cool. It was also packaged great for protection. The pup was awesome as well"
