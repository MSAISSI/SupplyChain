While typing quickly you will often notice that it misses keystrokes entirely, or types random letters you did not press. I use a computer and type all day for my profession and have a WPM of 75+, having a very responsive and accurate keyboard is essential, this is not it. I would give it a 0 if I could."

          "Contenu": "I submitted a refund request and was responded to within 24-48 hours, via email, with a list of trouble-shooting tasks and told that if none of them solved the \"loud and glitchy keys\" to contact them for a replacement because it had been purchased more than 30 days ago. I replied the same day, advised them that I had completed the \"to do list\" but still found the keyboard to be extremely \"rough\", but more importantly, I explained that it had only been FIFTEEEN days (provided a copy of the Perixx email order confirmation), and that I'd like to process the return. Since then, I have contacted Perixx at least SEVEN times (via reply emails and new requests through their site). I am STILL waiting for a response, by someone, other than the automated reply email stating that \"someone will contact me within 24 hours\". It has now been more than a week, which definitely sends a very clear message that they are either incompetent (lacking the skill-set needed to process a return / reply to emails) or deceitful (waiting for the 30 day window to lapse). I will begin posting this review on every site possible until this issue gets resolved. Only make a purchase you are prepared to keep!"

So hacked off I started a warranty claims which was a real chore to begin with.. All I've had are two emails telling me to plug it into other pcs and they ignored everything I write. So off to facebook and after two weeks of messaging them on Messenger, still no one has answered, I know were in PDCV19 but I'm working and looking after my clients so why can't they?So as of this moment I'm into two warranties for two badly made mice and a company that refuses to answer any form of communication. Thats why Im here and I don't often spill my guts over the internet but this level of service is unjustifiable.JJ"

I hated the Microsoft version because the keys are located with unusual spacing and I frequently missed the delete or backspace key and was constantly hitting the all caps key.  The spacing on the Perixx is much better and fits my large hands. I also really like the added backlight feature.  I highly recommend this keyboard especially if you have large hands.

I had purchased the Perixx 422, which is an awesomely quiet keyboard, but the layout of having the Up Arrow key where the (rt)Shift key should be, made it impossible to use. But the quietness was awesome. Even the scissor version of this 335RD keyboard was nowhere near as quiet as the 422, but Perixx has been great at helping me with my return.

GORGEOUS. come with an ergo mouse too! The one I rejected had a padded wrist rest, which got hot - absorbs body heat and throws it back at you - this one has a solid plastic wrist rest, no heat problem. The mouse is like silk, so quiet, smooth. Keyboard is very responsive, angle for wrists is so comfy, slightly clicky, but way way less than the old mechanical keyboard. For just \u00a340... bargain!

This thing is great - my neck and shoulder pain is starting to subside, and the typing experience is outstanding.  You don't really need to be a touch typist to use it and it's actually made my typing better as it forces my hands into a much more comfortable position.  This is a well-made and designed keyboard and it doesn't break the bank.  Once they release a wireless version I am making these the standard kit for my company."

The only thing (for me) that is lacking is the Open New Browser button. This is a perfect replacement for those (like myself) that have used the Microsoft 4000. With that said I do not expect the key print to wear off in a few weeks. Would purchase again Would also recommend to anyone that is looking for an exceptional keyboard."

          "Contenu": "Received my \"PERIMICE-520 - Wired Ergonomic Vertical Trackball Mouse Adjustable Angle Programmable Buttons\" quickly. I bought the Kensington Pro Fit Ergo Vertical trackball earlier, so I will compare the two. The Kensington has a nicer feel in the hand, I like the texture and the weight of the mouse. It also has two more progammable buttons than the Permice-520 (though these have been more in the way than useful) and the software for the Kensington has more options. HOWEVER, the trackball stutters whenever I move the ball slowly for fine movements, which is bad for trying to click a small button or place a curser where you want it to highlight text ect. I have cleaned the ball and the inside of the mouse, felt for rough spots, called Kensington support which had me do all those things again, to no avail. I am am not the only one with this problem, I have seen this complaint in other reviews and thought it was just a fluke... I have had no problems like this with the Perimice-520. I decided to take the ball from the Perimice and try it in the Kensington, as the ball seemed smoother. It works great now. Put the Kensington ball in the Perimice and surprisingly, it is also working fine. For about $20 less, the Perimice-520 is definitely worth it to avoid the irritation of a trackball that doesn't give you smooth fine movement out of the box. It's a solid trackball that I am still happy to use, even coming from a trackball that feels a touch nicer in the hand."
