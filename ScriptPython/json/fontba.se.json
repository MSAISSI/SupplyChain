          "Contenu": "Update: It is funny to me that FontBase reacted to this review within less than 24 hours.When I purchased the software, the information was that credentials for account login would be sent immediately after purchase. No credentials came, I obviously checked spam, etc. After a few hours I e-mailed them on the same day asking for my credentials. As it was a Friday I figured maybe an answer would come on Monday. No answer. I then e-mailed them two more times over the course of a week. No answer, no credentials.In the meantime I had figured out that I could reset the account password as they had apparently used my purchase e-mail to create the account. But when they chose not to answer my queries at all and I realised that the product wasn't good anyway, I asked for a refund. And lo and behold, within less than 24 hours I get a refund - the refund confirmation comes in form of an answer showing all my messages to them, in which I ask them for the credentials. So they saw all my e-mails!So: I get a quick refund, I get a quick response to this review. Obviously they are reading their messages - why would they choose not to answer my simple request and send me the promised login credentials after purchase? ---From product to customer service: nothing is great about FontBase.I did not receive customer support.The software is not intuitive to the point of being unpractical. The subscriber version is no better. For beginners and pros there are better alternatives out there.FontBase also installs a ton of junk protocols and files on the Mac. For example an incoming connection allowing to bypass your firewall. That's absolutely not necessary for this kind of software; and it's either just bad coding or super-dodgy."

          "Contenu": "First and foremost, I want to express my appreciation for the excellent services FontBase provides. As a satisfied customer, I have been using your font management software for a while now and have found it to be reliable and user-friendly.However, recently I have encountered an unexpected problem. While the fonts activated through FontBase work perfectly fine on my Windows 10 Pro operating system, they do not appear to function correctly within Figma. When attempting to utilize the activated fonts in Figma, they do not show up in the font selection menu, preventing me from using them for my design projects.I have taken the following troubleshooting steps in an attempt to resolve this issue:Restarted both FontBase and Figma to ensure all processes are refreshed.Verified that the fonts are activated and working correctly in other applications, including other design software.Checked for any pending updates for both FontBase and Figma and made sure they are running the latest versions.Confirmed that Figma is able to access and utilize other fonts installed on my system, indicating that the issue is specific to FontBase fonts.Despite these efforts, the fonts still do not show up within Figma. As Figma is an essential tool for my design workflow, it is crucial for me to have seamless integration with FontBase to maintain consistency and productivity.I kindly request your assistance in resolving this matter. It would be greatly appreciated if you could provide guidance on any potential solutions or workarounds to enable FontBase fonts to function correctly within Figma. Additionally, if there are any known compatibility issues between FontBase and Figma, I would be grateful for any information or updates on this matter.Please let me know if you require any further information or if there is any additional troubleshooting I can attempt on my end to assist with the resolution process.Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to your response and a swift resolution to the font compatibility issue between FontBase and Figma.Best regards,"

In addition, Fontbase currently only allows Google as a font provider, which considerably reduces the scope of services. Last but not least, the subscription model is recommended even if you are already a paying customer, which is an absolute no-go for me personally."

Therefore, I use it only out of necessity, not knowing an alternative.My answer to Fontbase: I am aware that developing good software costs money. I also like to do without further updates but not like to do without the functionality of the once purchased software. You, however, restore the functionality to that of the freeware version after the subscription expires. These are not fancy cloud-based service options but normal program parts. Then it is better to charge for the updates in my opinion."

This takes a lot of time depending on the number of types that you have.On the other hand we still have trouble with the new processor on mac and fotbase, the only way to make it work is going to start icon of illustrator, for example, and mark the option open with Rosseta. If we don't do that the auto activate fonts doesn't work.On top of that it would be nice that the soft will accpet PostScript fonts, because we have a huge amount of types on that format and it's a pitty to loose them"

I started using it to save on load times and only use the fonts I needed but it just ended up causing more problems.For starters, there's an incredible lag on the program. I was trying to speed up the programs I need these fonts for by disabling the ones I don't need, but FontBase is just as slow to load, if not slower, than having all the fonts enabled at all times. And many times, fonts that I turned on in FontBase would not appear at all in Illustrator or InDesign, requiring several rounds of restarting those apps or deleting preference files. Since I stopped using FontBase, I've had zero problems loading these fonts.Being able to preview fonts and organize them is helpful when I'm trying to choose the right one for a project, but even using FontBase just for this purpose causes my entire system to lag. Overall, the few benefits this program has (font previewing, organization, free) aren't worth all the lost time in lag and performance."

Watch Folder Issue - Google Drive:If your FontBase root folder is on your Google Drive (for working with teams to sync collections), you CAN NOT create Watch Folders. This means you can\u2019t watch your System fonts, OR, if you have your fonts organized outside the FontBase root and want to \u201cWatch\u201d those folders for changes vs. making copies you can\u2019t.The only workaround for this is to have FontBase installed locally, and then each team member can use a \"Watched Folder\" for Google Drive, however, then Collections are no longer shared/synced.It's a huge pain point for working with teams when using Google Drive. There's an entire thread on it in their Support Forms called \"Google Drive - Watch Folders Issues\"; unfortunately we can't add links in reviews.3. Lack of Sub-Folders for Collections make things a bit messy for organization. It's also problematic for Teams due to point #2.The UI is nice, the price is right, but there are some of those smaller grievances that have us looking to move back to Connect Fonts (formerly Suitcase Fusion)"

Because of the design of the software it looks like a phone application. I find it useless as a designer who is used to working with classic menus. In some fonts, even if I reduce the font size, I cannot see the preview of the font fully because I cannot adjust the line height. When typing the font name in the font search section, because of live search, some letters are not written. I have to correct it every time. There is no problem with my keyboard, I checked :) Font tagging feature is very useless. When I want to add one of the tags I created before to a font I just installed, the program doesn't allow me to select the tag. I have to type the full tag name every time. This wastes a lot of time. I would be very grateful if you bring a feature where we can detect and delete duplicated fonts. For example, it would be much more useful if we could select and delete all fonts which has both OTF and TTF format with single selection. Or it would be more useful if it finds duplicated fonts by analyzing them. My last request is completely related to the dollar exchange rate in the country where I live. Since the dollar exchange rate in Turkey is 18.62\u20ba, the subscription fee of your application is unfortunately expensive for me. If you have the opportunity to make a discount on the annual subscription fee, I would love to take advantage of it.Have a nice day..."

After a search, going back and forth on my design software, I get back to FontBase and the search is still on but not in an obvious way. And I forget that I was using it. So I go to my collections and fonts do not appear. It always takes me a few moments to understand what is going on. To resolve that, maybe the search tool could have more contrast when on. Mabe in fluo green instead of subtle purple...3) The fact that a font is part of a family is also not obvious enough. The bold gray number is not enough to help me to find a font. Also, it is not cool to have to go to another page to see the entire family. This could be done in a \"drop down\" style without leaving the page."

For years I struggled with the clumsiness of Font Book on my Mac, mostly because it was free. Then I stumbled onto FontBase, tried out the free version and loved it. I'm amazed at what is included for free. Although there were some features the paid version included that I felt would be useful, I mainly felt that a piece of software that is so well thought out, so well supported and also reasonably priced, deserved my hard earned dollars. I renewed my annual subscription for my second year now just the other day.While I really love the speed and minimal fuss approach the developers have taken with the UI, for me, the ability to 'Add' watched folders is the deal sealer. I have manually sorted my fonts into folders named by style categories on my iMac, which I sync to my cloud backup. These then become available when I sync my Macbook which has the same FontBase setup for when I work remotely. Any font I add into my watched folders immediately becomes available for activation in FontBase on both machines and easily locatable. Such a time saver.I'm sure it's possible this feature is available elsewhere, but I'd be surprised if it was done better and for free.I cannot recommend enough the work these guys are doing, if fonts are your thing."
