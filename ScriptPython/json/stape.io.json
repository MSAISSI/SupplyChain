This does not make it \"easier\" {website claims \"Easiest Way to Server-side Tracking} in terms of \"if you don't code, you can still do this.\" The knowledge base are written for search engines not humans. In their help videos, everything is already set-up and they are giving a tour, not showing how to set it up.Do NOT buy this without paying someone to set it up for you, that is what will make it \"easier.\" Or course, they are happy to provide you with a quote to bill you for setting it up, when their support is utterly confusing and unhelpful - they will just send you copies of the 2,000 word blog posts you have already read."

          "Contenu": "We have been their customers since January 2021, but their service has never worked. The assistance is NON-EXISTENT, poor, they don't solve any kind of problem and they switch to sending emails by unloading the barrel of problems on other services such as Facebook or Leadsbridge. I'm really tired, we are wasting a lot of time, money and resources because all their server side tracking is busted, we have NEVER had a social marketing campaign that has proper tracking due to the inefficiency of stape. The clear proof is that using a custom audience created on Salesmanago the campaigns work, but stape reads the purchase event quadrupling it!! so it's totally screwed. Our technical team spends a lot of time verifying their errors and NONE OF THEM makes themselves available. Terrible, Never again, stay away!"
