That\u2019s not helpful at all as this is a Christmas present. I am very disappointed with the whole service. You should work on better customer service where a solution is found."

Thom | Senior Customer Happiness Agent (Apption Labs)Nov 30, 2023, 10:30\u202fAM GMTHi Richard,Thanks for getting back to me! Thank you for the information. Unfortunately, these over-temperature events on your probe void the warranty. If you'd like to purchase new probes I'd be happy to send you an invoice for $59.00 total (a 50% saving on the MSRP). If that sounds OK please let me know and I'll get the invoice right over to you! Take care and stay safe and I hope to hear from you soon. Kind regards,ThomCan\u2019t afford spending any more money I got these for a present they were expensive so I guess they don\u2019t stand behind their product when you have a flareup and they make them go bad"

The max temp is 275 degrees C, this is ridulously low and impractical as from time to time something will happen to make it go over that temp. I   wrote to meater to complain and they asked questions including my login to the app, they then used this info to decline a replacement by saying it had a voided warranty as it had been over temp after stringing me along with a bunch of other questions. Product is entirely impractical to use even when used in reasonable and normal manner. Stick to more robust solutions such as Webber, I replaced the useless meater with another Webber, I had the previous Webber probe for 8 years. Meater is a terrible product terrible warranty."

There's NO WAY you can come close to this level of perfect cooking without the MEATER probes.A MUST for any serious BBQer!------------------------------------MY REVIEW UPDATE....While the temperature accuracy is impressive, the sturdiness of the probes is below average. On the third cook (rotisserie chicken), cook temperature of 260F, once the cook was done I pulled out the probe and the ancient temperature bit (the black numbered side of the probe) detached from the rest of the probe. Since I've only owned the MEATER block for only three weeks, it doesn't bode well for long term use, considering the original cost of the item. After contacting APPTION LABS, they have issued a ticket but have yet to address the issue. So for these reasons, I will now NOT recommend the MEATER probes. There are now other brands of there, all of which would be a consideration."

I box was delivered without any paperwork, no packing list (I think they shipped me someone else's order). I went to their support website but there is no way to correct a mis-shipment or to contact anyone to get this corrected. I sent an Email but no one replies. I tried calling their office in California and no one answers, just recorded messages saying to use their web support (that has proven to be worthless). I feel like they have stolen my money. VERY BAD accountability and recourse for the customer."

Since 3 months in, if I listen to the cooking times suggested by the probe it will overcook/burn food. I reached out to MEATER, however they were adamant this was a user error. A couple months later, the probe now refuses to connect to the hub even when they are within 0.5m of each other. Once again I reached out to MEATER, who have decided this time to shut down my raised case without any contact with myself. I would strongly advise to purchase another product, I have had nothing but trouble with mine."

I have followed up with 2-3 emails but Meater simply will not respond at all.  In these days of social media, I find it astonishing that this company's customer  support is so lacking.  Also, I always find it troubling when there is no phone number to make actual person to person contact.  Of note, I bought a different unit called \"TempSpike\" that is the same set up and so far works just fine AND is less expensive. Still, I would really like to salvage the Meater probes I have so I have functioning units and not just big fat toothpicks."

As were a group of my friends who attended this BBQ but they saw the damage to the probes and are aware of, and not impressed by my struggles to resolve this with Meater. So at present, 1 disgruntled customer and 5 dubious potential customers. Given the cost, the service is shocking."

I followed very carefully all the instructions and I am a very experienced cook. I made contact directly with MEATER + in the USA and all I got was a robot response no human contact whatsoever and my issue was never resolved. Unfortnutely at the same time my wife's father passed away and we lost important time and the ability to return via Amazon within the 30 day time frame. We tried to resolve the issue with Amazon but once again we were in the robotic world that Meater+ lives in. It is abosolutley unaccceptable that a company makes itself non contactable to answer and respond to very professional questions and in this case a legitimate complaint. Clearly a huge risk if one buys this product."

No answer from that either.  Clearly our unit is faulty and no one wants to know about it.  Our unit is in brand new condition, having only been used a handful of times and it\u2019s never worked - what is going on with your supposed 2 year warranty????

It seems very clear given my experience that I received a defective product. I reached out to Meater\u2019s support team to see if they would uphold their warranty and of course, they have not. They said that I have exceeded the maximum temperature on the probe which caused it to break which is not true since the temperature that the probe has been reading has been inaccurate since day one. I have double checked the temperatures with another probe and it has been way off. Additionally, Meater support has said that I am outside of the one year warranty period.. which I am not. I have NOT had this probe for longer than a year. A real disappointment but I am not surprised given other customer\u2019s experiences. They offered to send me a replacement probe at my own cost but given my experience with their customer support and fake warranty offered, I will likely be using another product and I do not want to send this company anymore of my money since they have no intent of fulfilling their own warranty.

          "Contenu": "Update:  7/15/2022.  I did get a response today, and an authorization to return for an exchange.  I do appreciate that.  I understand in today's world, things are hectic.  My only suggestion to Meater is to at least communicate to customers that you are working on it, and it may take X number of days, or even X number of weeks before you may hear back.  I'm good with that.  What I don't like is feeling ignored and hopeless.  Thank you for your help, and I'm hoping the replacement is as good as I hear it is.Received my Meater for a Father's Day gift, and it would not connect.  I tried every trouble shooting article on Meaters website to no avail.  I did send in a customer service request email.  2 days later, I received an email back with a cut and paste from their website of all the things I've already done.Since then, I responded, left 5 different emails stating I still have issues, and not even a response.I have since been able to use it twice, but that requires me to unpair the meater, turn off my Bluetooth, take out the probe from the block, open the app, turn on Bluetooth and wait for it to once again pair to my device.  There has to be an easier way, but I will never know as my questions are ignored by Meater.I want to be able to like this thermometer, I like the premise behind it, but with ZERO customer support, I'm not sure it's worth the money."

          "Contenu": "Meater stopped working, I followed all troubleshooting directions on their site before getting in touch. There followed endless questions, tests, photos sent, further questions, more photos. Now referred to senior team. Just deal with your customer..stop hedging and prevaricating and wasting time. What a customer fail!Update 5 March 2023. I\u2019ve been sent a replacement probe, but it\u2019s the charging unit that\u2019s at fault. Also what I\u2019ve been sent is a regular Meater when my faulty item is the more expensive Meater Plus. Again, I\u2019m without the item I paid for and have experienced utterly haphazard customer service. This is just a dreadful way to respond to a faulty item. Very disappointing, I\u2019ll be taking further action.Further Update 8th March. Replacement probe will not communicate with original base unit - Meater just replaced probe, not base unit. They now want me to book a service call with them. I have already gone through the issues many times. It is beyond frustrating to have this protracted process to sort out a problem where replacement of full unit is required.Update 17 March 2023 It\u2019s taken 34 communications to finally get to the point where I MIGHT have a replacement Meater on the way to replace my 8 month old Meater which just stopped working. To be fair, Daniel, who took on the case about 3 weeks ago, has tried to get me a new meater quickly and I got a complimentary pair of gloves about a week ago, but the Meater itself is still a no show. It\u2019s not a stock issue, it\u2019s a systems and operations issue, made worse by Meater\u2019s refusal to act promptly and appropriately  to deal with the initial issue. Would I buy a Meater again? Not unless there was a very evident improvement in their after sales service, not withstanding Daniels valiant attempts..their technology and processes hampered him in sorting this out"

          "Contenu": "MEATER Failed on the big dayI am giving the MEATER + one star as when I needed it on Christmas day it failed badly and I had to resort to using another meat probe. Good PointsWhen it works its very good. Been using for 3 months in 3 different ovens. You get to find out how good the ovens are or not. You see what temperature the oven actually reaches and the temperature fluctuation. Everything I have cooked with, mainly meat roasts and fish have come out perfect every time in each of the different ovens, that is a big plus for me.Bad Points10th time using the MEATER; Cooking Christmas dinner; a Four Bird roast, around cooking halfway  it failed to connect.  I tried many times to reconnect but it would not. And as of now it will not connect. A product costing \u00a3100 used 10 times over 3 months failing is poor. It has always been hand washed, the probe always in the meat at the required notch, and the battery is full, tested with green light confirming on base station.Other IssuesSome of my cooks that are saved have wrong temperatures for the peak and target, they are way off, and I can see no logical reason for the error; one says Peak 58C and Target 77C which is mathematically impossible. All the Peak temperatures are incorrect. They have a serious software issue. MEATER claim the probe is water resistant with this in mind I have always avoided getting wet when cleaning and I dry the probe immediately. However, I feel this is unrealistic and that the probe should have been made waterproof. MEATER claim the plus has a range of 50 meters. I seriously doubt this claim, in the real world through walls. Marketing Emails: Be prepared for a lot of them! You can unsubscribe which is what I did, but it was ridiculous the amount I was getting, around every other day. Also, the app has offers most of the time: \"free oven mitt\" is usually there, again annoying, they would be better spending time improving the app rather than aggressive marketing.I would not recommend you buy this product as it is not reliable.UPDATE JAN 19th 2023I reinstalled the app and the MEATER+ worked again. However, this lasted three times before it failed again."

          "Titre": "Disappointed with this product and Customer Service",
          "Contenu": "I have been very disappointed with the MEATER+ product and the service received throughout my transaction with MEATER. To be explicit, I have just recently received a part refund (my outlay minus postage and a 15% re-stocking fee). However it was only after a repeated and concerted effort to underscore my concerns about this product in several follow up emails.In short, if you plan to use this product in a baking tray in your oven I would caution you about the product's efficacy. The material of the tray and for that matter, ovens in general are, in my opinion, crucial as to whether it is likely to work or not. Many people use a tray to keep a moist and uniform environment to roast the meat. The MEATER site lists several ovens or roasting devices which they say are compatible but don't specifically warn you about the use of a roasting tray. I note that there are several people who have had connectivity issues between the probe and the repeater even in the approved devices. So I simply say that the problem is likely to be part of a phenomena known as the \"Faraday Effect\". This is what I said to the MEATER Customer Service people in my initial communication of complaint of which there were several frustrating follow ups.\"HiI have purchased a new Meater+ for my partner's birthday. We've also downloaded the latest update to the Android app. Batteries are fresh. Probe fully charged as per instructions etc etc.The issue is that the probe is losing connectivity with the Repeater Unit when it's place in a FULLY enclosed metal baking tray. I've isolated the variables involved in placing the probe out of the oven, in the oven on its own in the tray etc etc etc.... I've observed all the max distances between the various components. It functions OK in the oven without the metal dish.I'm a physicist and can understand why there's little or no signal with a tray involved. Effectively the metal dish acts as Faraday Cage. For a simple understanding of this phenomena - see here in case your techos are unaware of this Look up Faraday Cage on Wiki or some such]. This phenomena is used in every day situations in commerce and industry to shield devices from stray or aberrant electro-magnetic (EM) radiation.Thus ... the low power electro-magnetic (EM) energy from the probe is absorbed by the metal shell of the tray. In addition, you must appreciate that the probe is also place in a hostile environment in terms of the material ovens are made of. That is, they are also a Faraday Cage. The glass door of the oven may be the only relief available for transmission.Surely this is a major design flaw. Many people use a metal tray to maintain a consistent environment to cook the meat. It maintains moisture in the meat, speeds cooking and keeps the oven walls much cleaner.Clearly we could change the cookware etc and experiment with RF (radio- frequency) transparent materials etc. But this is both expensive and has an uncertain outcome. Even some porcelain and clay cookware have metal oxides in them which interferes with RF transmission.\"Clearly the ordinary individual does not know how RF opaque their oven is and some are more opaque than others due to their construction. Thickness of the metal used and how much surrounds the tray is at issue. I think the CONCEPT is a good idea but the execution is problematic. I simply sound this out as a warning to those considering buying this device and I think this is a fair and reasonable undertaking so you don't waste your time and money and end up with a disappointed recipient of your kind thoughts if it's a gift for them."

It took 18 days to get a reply.  They wanted me to create a video and send it.5: Mostly their repsonse are infering that I'm not doing something correctly.I'm sorry but my opion is that for the cost of this product, I shouldn't need to do much but turn it on and cook."

I asked if they knew when as they following week was Father\u2019s Day and they replied advising they didn\u2019t know when they would be back in stock. So I asked for a refund. 4 days with no reply so I opened a dispute with PayPal. I then got a reply from them saying the order was being cancelled and I would get the refund in a couple of days. Refund never came. However the meater did show up. So I guess that\u2019s a win? Meanwhile I had spent more money on a new present thinking the order was cancelled.

These are very expensive items, and maybe there is a reason their service lines are so busy?Its ticket number #124625 by the way apption labs. is this the only way to contact you?Update: actually it\u2019s a great piece of technology when it works and after 6 weeks of back and forth with the oh so slow support dept i finally got a replacement sent out almost a week after they received my returned non-functioning one. Wish it was more robust.  Hope they can learn some lessons from all feedback and improve."

Gave my UK address as delivery address and it said they cannot deliver to UK country. At the time, my wife was back home in our other country and so i tried with that address. It was accepted by Meater, I paid up a bit more for postage and soon enough received info that items were dispatched. After parcel didn't arrive for more than a week, I checked tracking number only to find out:1) Parcel was not allowed to travel due to restricted goods policy2) It was being returned to sender in UKIn UK???!?!?!?! It was being sent from UK to Europe but when i tried first delivery address here in England,  it was rejected because \"we do not deliver to that country\"????Anyway, contacted support and 2 days later still no reply. There's nobody you can reach and, of course, like many other garbage operations, there's no phone number.Steer clear of them."

App could have more cuts of meat (or include as many of the different names for the same cut as possible). It also overheats earlier than I expected when searing at the end of a slow cook over fire. This may be unavoidable for a precision piece of kit (or maybe the warning comes on early to protect the unit). Either way, not a massive issue. Would buy again and certainly recommend to anyone reading this review."

My only regret is the limitations of Bluetooth connectivity radius. I do a lot of slow smokes, and if I move out of Bluetooth radius, the probe is useless. I\u2019d like to see wifi functionality and Internet connectivity so I can monitor the cook beyond the present Bluetooth  range radius. For short smoke and grilling or oven roasts, it\u2019s fabulous. But for a long smoke like brisket or pulled pork, battery life and Bluetooth range makes it fall short. Regarding battery life, I have to say it\u2019s pretty impressive. It exceeds my expectations. Nevertheless for longer smoking like brisket I have to insert the probe at the end of the cook because battery life is not viable for more than about 4 to 6 hours."

          "Titre": "The meater is great, App not so much",
          "Contenu": "The meater is a great thermometer because of its long lasting battery and surprisingly good Bluetooth. Sadly the pre set cooks in the App can never be trusted to 100%. For example on a quick steak this thermometer is close to useless. Calculated cook time is inaccurate and when to remove from heat is well off to reach your goal. Low and slow cooks work fairly well, again with a learning curve from the user. The remove from heat warning is way to early. If I\u2019d use the notification for my brisket I would always end up 5 degrees below my goal. And 5 minutes of resting for a 17 lb brisket!? Maybe the cooks in the app will improve. The device itself works phenomenal and I can\u2019t complain. Well worth the money if you know what kind of temps you\u2019re looking for and take the app suggestions with a grain of salt.Edit:My experience with the steaks came from making a ribeye steak. I set a target of 125\u00b0, fired up the grill and threw the steak on. I flipped it once at around 90\u00b0 and by the time the app told me to \u201eremove from heat\u201c the steak was overshooting the target and ended up at 137\u00b0 when done resting. It did work for me, when reverse searing and not using the meater at the end of the grill. So far I just ignore the estimated times because during low and slow cooks, they sometimes show 23 hours remaining. Even with me changing nothing about the setup (grill stays closed with set temperature), the cook takes about 12-13 hours. And while grilling a steak, by the time the app shows an estimated time, it\u2019s telling you to \u201eremove from heat\u201c. I think this might be due to measuring ambient temperature but not the grate temp from the direkt fire."

For those without a phone connection, they do okay, but you have another device to deal with.  For those that had phone connectivity, usually the app is a bit of a mess.  MEATER's app is pretty solid.  There's room for improvement in the UI, but it is leaps and bounds ahead of the competition.  Easy to use, guides you through cook setup, and the predictive capabilities are pretty good - not always precise, but it beats trying to figure it out yourself."
