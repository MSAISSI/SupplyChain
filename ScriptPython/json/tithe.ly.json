I didn't received any email even the spam folder. \"This 1 star review is not a reflection of our products and services\"Yes,it is. It's your fault in the first place but I don't see you take any responsibility or apologies for people's inconvenience and bad experience. In stead, you just blamed people for not having your consent and ordered. It's not a good service attitude and deserves 1 star."

Not my problem others are scammers. Once again it was cancelled without notification and it is not right having a discount code to your website and not honoring it. Does not matter now as we will probably not use the app in the future due to the bad experience. Thanks."

          "Contenu": "I have had multiple instances where I've needed support for issues and their online chat people are not online during working hours.  It says they'll email you to help later but all they send is a copy of the chat log from a \"noreply\" email address.  Because of that I requested a call back from their customer support. It only gave me 3 options for call back times the next day so I picked one and put it in my calendar.  Customer support never called me during that time.  When I checked my email they had emailed me saying the time I chose didn't work for them and they never called me to help.  I can't do my job if their website doesn't provide the correct information in reports and their customer service department has no option to actually talk to someone who can help.12/29/22 Update:  I received an email from Kris Parker at Tithely regarding my review.  I was told that they've made changes to their supports ticketing system.  I wasn't given an answer as to why when I contact them during normal US business hours there's never a person available from their normal team or their Australia team to message you back.  The bot just tells you no one's available and they just can't help you.  I was also told they just have a very small support team so they can't guarantee if you schedule a meeting with them for support it will be kept.  If you have no refunds and don't need to see detailed reports for accounting then Tithely's system works fine.  I'm just saying if you need those detailed reports because Tithely just pulled a few hundred dollars out of your bank account for a refund but doesn't include that transaction in their systems report, because they just don't (still can't figure out why the cause for a negative \"deposit\" isn't included in reports), don't expect to be able to reach customer service for help."

There is no way to save the church name for future reference or giving and it does not give you the option to use your payment method one time.  They make you save your payment method and have all of your card information.  I think it is a good concept but very poorly designed.

We have not had a 'collection' as part of our service for a long time and more and more we had noticed that people did not bring money to church to put in the plate provided. With the increased use of cards and the decline in the use of cheques people were finding it harder to give. Introducing the congregation to Tithe.ly has made it very easy for all our folks who are on line. We still have one or two who are not tech minded for whom to find a solution. But overall we are very pleased with the ease of use and the enthusiasm of most of our Church."

This is the one thing that prevents us from closing our books each month, as we have to wait for the deposits (so they will match up with those on the bank statemets). At the same time, we prefer to push ACH payments so people do not use credit cards to co tribute more than they can really afford.2) fins a way to hide or delete, even in the background) unused or obsolete giving types. We have had a lot of them and the list is getting too long, for no good reason. Many of ours could be deleted. Maybe there is a way to delete them, but I have not seen it."

When COVID-19 changed our ministry plans and gathering options, having Tithe.ly already in place helped us maintain our level of giving and allowed us to set up a way for people to partner with us to meet COVID-19 needs. There have been a couple of areas that I've talked with Tithe.ly about that would better meet the church's needs, they have been very open to listen and have worked through them with us. I appreciate their ministry mindset and partnership with advancing the gospel of Jesus."

I personally use the bank deposit option the most to gather the data to put in our financial program. With the change to the new version, it sadly has made it a little more difficult to get to the full information of the giver. In the previous version, everything was on one screen including the name, the amount given, the amount of the fee charged and the amount actually deposited into the bank account. It also gave me the date the transaction was initiated. Now, however, I have to click on three different options per transaction to get that information and still have to calculate what was actually given. It's not as big of a deal if one person gives per day but with multiples, it gets a bit sticky. That would be my only thing that holds me back on the 5th star."

Tithely is still growing and changing which can be scary to users, but the support team has always been helpful in answering questions and explaining the functions available. Tithely also communicates its changes very clearly and makes sure its users can use what it provides. This is a one-stop hub for church giving, our website, our newsletter, and ministry scheduling; before, our congregation was using 4 separate hosts, and having it all consolidated into one integrated system is so helpful. I do sincerely recommend Tithely, and encourage anyone struggling to decipher the ins and outs of it to reach out to its awesome support team."
