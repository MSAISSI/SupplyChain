I checked my other emails from them and the increase was not communicated prior. They have issued a percentage discount for this issue but I declined this as a discount requires that I make a purchase. A credit is preferred.Also not happy with the company's Thanksgiving message: they just now sent a thank you to customers with a button to make a call (in other words buy credit). No thought to offer a Thanksgiving or Black Friday discount to customers that keep the business going. Discounts have never been a thing with this company. SMH"

I messaged the support and they told me that it will automatically renew on the 6th of November. I asked if I could cancel the plan an resubscribe but they didn\u2019t get back to so I went and cancelled the expired plan. When I went to subscribe for the plan again, that one is no longer available as I was told after I reported the issue because I wanted to reverse my cancellation within minutes of finding out that this plan was NLA!!! I have used Keepcalling for several years now, but since this last rate increase, it appears that customer service has gone out the window. I have received notification of other plans that are costing up to half the price but I usually am a loyal person to what I subscribe to. Due to NO attempt to resolve this issue has been apparent, I am questioning what their protocol is at handling any issues at all??? \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude1f\ud83d\ude1fThe point that I was making is that if I would have been told to wait until November 6th to renew the 650 plan, then the plan would have still been available\u2026 unless you are saying that even on the 6th of November I would have been told that it would not auto renew.I should have been advised that this plan would no longer be available if that was the case."

I called to cheer my uncle at his 75 yr annyversary. We managed to exchange basic information but that is it. VERY disappointing. The previous provider never had any problem with connection. So, I know that the problems with connection are due to specifics of KeepCalling. I'll continue looking for another provider."

Also, they should switch to a per second billing as sometimes the phone rings for 20 seconds and you get charged for one minute without even speaking to someone. I was not able to wish new year wishes to my Dad and Mom as the connection was not established yet the phone keeps ringing for long time. Thank you."

Then the 2nd call was terminated with zero balance warning message. I had enough balance in my account to begin with so checked my call history right away and found empty account balance. The reason why it became zero $ was they charged twice rate of local access number call for 800 access number. I knew I pay some fee for using 800 line use but never knew double charge for that.

I have experienced on multiple occasions being dropped after on hold for anywhere from 18-22 minutes.  Then I lose my queue and have to start over.  Aside from the frustration, I have lost those call minute credits.  I have used my G-Voice and another app and never had this experience.  But 75% of the time I exceed 18 minutes holding I get dropped by KeepCalling.Regarding response from KeepCalling, of course I implemented all their suggestions. I even tried a few of my own corrective measures given I\u2019m technologically adept. Unfortunately, results were the same. Dropped calls after 18-22 minutes."

It is unfortunate that, due to Apple\u2019s policies, Keep Calling have no option to add Voice Credit directly from the KeepCalling App, as you state in your reply. I am however able to add credit directly from the Toolani App using the same phone with the same IOS software.
