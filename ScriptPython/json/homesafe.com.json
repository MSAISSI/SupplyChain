          "Contenu": "They are procrastinators! It took from the middle of September until now to finally pay something to me. 3 months on an AC problem. And I'm still arguing with them about it. Trying to get reimbursement what is fair.  Their BBB rating is negative! They refused to replace anything on my AC unit until I complained. They are still not paying me what the plan says. They say the compressor is out and will replace that. Due to their procrastination I had to get the unit changed. Then they wanted to ask for the old parts. They're gone. I'm terminally ill I can't wait 30-60 days for them to approve the claim. Consequently, my system is the old r22 freon. No one will touch the compressor replacement! At that point you have to change to the new style. They didn't even want to replace the circuit boards that are pitted and burnt! They tried to find out any excuse not to pay up! I'm still trying to get a hold of upper management and I can't! I want to talk to the VP! No make that the CEO. Forgot, they lied to the BBB to get out of stuff! Don't waste your money on them. They now make you pay $120 per call!"

After weeks of going back and forth with HomeSafe and the electrician, I finally got a check for $226.00.  Homesafe  said it was because the repairs were needed due to weather which is not covered by my warranty.  Yet they agreed to \u201cpay me for parts and labor.\u201d  Well that\u2019s all there was, parts and labor.  Doesn\u2019t make sense.  Then my bank did not honor the check right away, they waited 10 days to deposit the funds into my account because according to Capital One Bank, there was a high risk the check would be not be honored.  Finally I did get the $226.00."

          "Contenu": "This company. does not have proper protocol in place for follow up.  Between Home Safe & Armis there is not good communication.  It's extremely frustrating as a customer to be told that you can NOT speak to a supervisor.  Home Safe may sell you your contract & take your payment out of your account but after that they really are of no help.  Not only could I not be connected to a supervisor, I was told that the prior person I spoke to works from home so he had no supervisor & the lady I spoke to said, \"My supervisor just went home\".  The supervisors apparently work for both Home Safe & Car Shield.  When a supervisor finally called me & left a message w/a number to call him back at iit was for Car Shield & the person stated that they could not help me.  I cannot get a straight answer from anyone.  I am so upset & frustrated to be treated this way.  Ive read my contract.  They sure never skip a beat taking out my money each month...but they are not in a hurry to follow up in their so called 24-48 hour period.  This review won't make a difference to this company, (which is sad) but it has helped me to explain my frustrations...hopefully someone will try & help me.  I also have waited a month for $150.00 payment that was to new mailed to me.  Thus far three different time they have gone back an d fourth stating yes, no and now yes they will pay me but no one has called me to get my information."

          "Titre": "Fraudulent Company",
          "Contenu": "On my first claim with the company, I had a washing machine that was less than 3 years old. It had an internal seal that failed, allowing water to leak into the transmission, causing the appliance to fail. Home Safe claimed there was rust inside the appliance, as if that would be some kind of neglect on my part, and refused to pay. After dealing with several people and managers in the company, I was eventually able to get them to pay the claim. I should've canceled then, but I foolishly stuck with them.A few months later, my water heater went out. The claim was submitted on a Saturday, and I was able to get the plumber out that same day. I found the plumber, not Home Safe. The estimate was submitted that evening. I received an email asking for more information on Monday, which was promptly responded to and sent in that same day. Their own policy is to approve the claim within 24 to 48 hours. I never heard back from anyone, so I called back several times over the course of the workweek. I was told the adjuster had either left early or had not come into work yet. When the adjuster finally called me on Thursday just before 5 pm, he actually straight up lied to me. He told me that he had requested additional information on Monday after receiving my email. He said he left a voicemail with me and the plumber. Neither one of us had any missed calls from the adjuster. He said he needed to know what caused the tank to rupture and precise pictures of the crack in the tank showing the leak. Anyone who knows anything about a water heater knows that once the tank ruptures, no plumber in their right mind would attempt to disassemble the water heater and repair the leak or determine where exactly it cracked. But that is exactly what the adjuster at Home Safe expected to happen. He said that without a reason why the tank ruptured and precise pictures of the leak location, he could not approve the claim. This is not unlike the power company asking me why did lightning strike the transformer down the street and cause your power outage? Were you able to get pictures of the lightning striking the transformer at that precise moment in time?30 Oct 2023 We have worked out a mutual settlement agreement. The details of which I am not allowed to share."
