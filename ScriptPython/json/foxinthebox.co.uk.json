They asked me to wait in between 8 am and 8 pm and then didn't delivery the parcel till the next day, with no explanation or follow up as to how well their service was.Fox in the Box also did not follow up with a courtesy e-mail to ask how my experience was.  So far, the computer is everything they said it would be.If Fox in the Box could get a more reliable courier, I would improve my rating."

I ordered the DELL T3610 Workstation E5-1650v2 64GB Quadro K4000 512GB SSD 1TB SATA and they gave me a bluetooth WiFi adapter for free plus a -10% on the price because of my first order!Then we had some issues:Firstly the courier decided to play football with the parcel and the first computer came broken! But the guys from Foxinthebox, in 2 days they setup and sent me a new one. Second, because of the holidays they didn't have memory and SSD's available, so they asked me if I could transfer the parts from the broken one to the new that arrived. With the very precise guidance of Mr Valentin I setup the computer via Whatsup, and managed to sort any settings for the workstation to run smoothly!I've never setup a computer before, but he helped me do that with no problems. I highly recommend the company because they are problem solvers and takes personally the issues that might appears.Very happy for my purchase."
