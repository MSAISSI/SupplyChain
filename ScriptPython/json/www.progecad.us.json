What it does do:- replicates 90% or autocad functions- has potential to achieve equivalent outputs as autocadThere is a significant BUT:- extremely unstable for non-basic tasks- poorly optimised for even computer hardware assembled with CAD in mind- significantly crash and bug heavyFor a domestic user this isn't particularly relevant; however as someone who lives and breaths design work, every hour lost counts, every repeat of a task is tedium, and lag is hell. I work in a team of 15 engineers and this program is known as 'progecrash', and that is absolutely no hyperbole. I have spoken, emailed, and discussed with the programers of progecad all this, and yet, their focus is on adding functions and gimmicks (to keep up with autodesk), not stability. You want good and reliable? you buy autocad. You want cheap? you get cheap, and it feels cheap, and you get treated cheap. This is the 'Made in Indonesia' of the CAD world; the 'Xu1' drill at bunnings is 30 bucks, and thats for a reason; view this the same."

Usually it is little problems that take a long time to get worked out.  Unless installing on a fresh Windows install, you often deal with things not installing correctly, most often you get a \"Error creating registry key: Code 5\" for some components.  For example, the PDF printer installation is notoriously frustrating in this way.Once you get past the pain of the installation, the basic operation is remarkably stable and rivals AutoCAD which costs 10x more."

The smoothness of A-CAD operation is clearly noticeable when going from progeCAD at home to A-CAD at work.\r App starts fast and seems to have all you would want. After using for several minutes the GUI seems to wane a bit and the mouse response begins lagging the user input. At times it's hard to pick an entity due to the lag. Also, when selecting inside reference for hatch and the complete inside area is not visible on the screen, it hangs the command and you end up killing it through the Task Manager. I've had to set the auto save incremental time to 1 minute due to the many crashed during hatch commands to reduce the work loss.\r Again, it's not bad for 500 bucks but it's not A-CAD either."

Enter progeCAD. While it is very similar to AutoCAD, I don't have all the shortcuts I had at work. My experience creating a new file went well. My first experience editing a small existing file created in AutoCAD resulted in a number of crashes and freezes mid command.  It reminded me of using AutoCAD with Window 95!  Price wise ProgeCAD is worth the frustration. Even AutoCAD LT is twice the price and you don't get as much. I am sure that I will adjust in time and get the bugs ironed out."

I have been using autocad r14 from 1999 and it has obviously had 23 years worth of updates and improvements which i knew when i bought my progecad 2024. The big difference is if i got stuck with autocad, i had a 1600 page manual from which i could almost always work out how to do whatever i wanted to do. My problem with progecad is there doesnt appear to be a manual, or at least not an up to date one. I could only find two manuals both approximately 200 pages but one is from 2011 and one from 2015 and neither are very comprehensive. If I am wrong and there is a manual I apologise. This would have been a 5 star review but for the lack of a decent manual. Also I can't find any tuition for the program apart from videos on YouTube. I am very much a classroom person but cannot find any hands on courses for progecad. Once again if I am wrong about this I apologise and would greatly appreciate being pointed in the right direction.Neil Walker"

I run the program on a very good machine (16 gb memory, nvidia driver).  I am hoping the new 64bit version handles the memory better.  I did buy an upgrade as the overall program works well and I like that I can buy the whole program versus the perpetual license subscription that autocad requires.  Hopefully they can get the kinks worked out as it would be nice for autocad to get a decent competitor in price and quality."

ProgeCAD was the answer. Being an AutoCAD user from versions that far back in time a lot of my command initiation are keyboard typing shortcuts, rather than trying to find a command on a toolbar or ribbon. I have yet to find a command shortcut I type that doesn't work! Kudos to you for such an excellent product! My learning curve was...non existent. Thanks for a superb product for a 10th of the cost."

Most of my drawing is in 2D; there are a few things I have to superimpose and then transfer to 3-D drawing. Things like headers, wall brackets, etc. Being a small contractor, having the capacity to draw up a rendering and present it to the architects and engineers saves us thousands of dollars. The purchase of progecad has been a nearly seamless transition from Autocad. And, for what it\u2019s worth, the follow up and obvious availability for support from Progecad is a welcome surprise, in this hurry up, sell it, get their money, and then act like you fell off the face of the earth, business world in which we live."

I was somewhat skeptical when I found ProgeCAD, but downloaded the trial copy and became very impressed with how intuitive the program operated; and I was able to use it with ease since it simulated (perfectly) the format and functions which I had become very familiar with through AutoCAD.  Old drawing files are imported with ease.  To be honest I was very tentative about moving to a new drafting program, but after using the program, I just cannot thank you enough for providing such a high quality product at a fair and reasonable price.  I am genuinely looking forward to using the program for many years to come.  Great Job progeCAD team!"
