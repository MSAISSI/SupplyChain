          "Titre": "RocketNode Hosting Reliable?",
          "Contenu": "Yesterday (09/03/23), I bought an Arma 3 Dedicated server for my Arma 3 Unit. Great prices and this isn't the first time I have hosted servers with Rocketnode. but yesterday's/Today's experience definitely won't be a 5-star review.  It could have been if some things changed. To start, Pricing is great 3.50 USD for a TS3 Server and 18.75 for a 6 GB RAM and 85 GB SSD (Arma 3 Dedicated server) is great. no issue there. they really do uphold their \"affordable\" tag they put on themselves. next is \"Fast\" This is where things go bad and where I had issues. Apparently, they were too fast and when I got my server there was a configuration on my server that made it unable to start at all. I would keep getting Error Exit 1 crashes and then have to ask the RN support team about it. other than that every time I got a server from RN (RocketNode) it has not had this issue. I'm going to guess it was just a bad deployment. I'm not going to let that be why I leave RN and stop hosting with them. Lastly \"Reliable\", this tag they put on themselves is true but I will say why it can make them look bad when you open a ticket. Before I go into what exactly happened. let it be known I understand \"Newer\" support members do not know everything. now into the main issue. Yesterday and Today (09/03 // 09/04/23) I would open 3 Tickets. 1. Would be talking about What servers there are, 2. Other questions about the servers 3. The Server crashing issue that made the server not able to go online.and now into the details. if you are known as a \"Senior support member\" and you dont know about that ticket (Arma, Minecraft. Fivem etc) then maybe let another Support member take it. not going to name names as thats wrong and if that person is read let them learn from it. but this was bad enough to where i think customers should know to ask for another support member. This ticket would start around 11:20 PM ET, i immideatly say theres issues with my Arma server and send a Screenshot with that. where a support member thats a senior member would ask me to verify myself (Reasonable tbh) and then ask me what server it is thats has a issue.... (Let it be known i only have a Team Speak Server and a Arma Server and the Arma server's name being \"Operator Development Group\") so its its kind OBVS that its the arma server. he would then ask me about is its Minecraft... like i already said it like 3/4 times thats its arma. then he trys to start the server (I tryed that... id hope) he would then refer to the arma dev. i would ask about a ETA and get \"He will be there when he gets available\" (12 hours so far) now into today fully. I get home from work and I get another support member who instantly knows what to do and gets my server going. so although it took a long time the Team Leads and Management have shown me that RocketNode has people who know the basics. My personal appraisal to Skylar B. - helped with the first ticket and was a Great help. he knows his job and does it well. Lewis T. - Helped with the last ticket and got the server working. def deserve and Management spot tbh. (If it wasn't for the bad parts I would do a solid 4/5 star but with everything I have to do 3... actually ill do 4 but know that with everything that has happened I am very on the wall about this star rating. I still hold RocketNode up and will still promote them on my Streams and all that. Thanks, Lane for helping aswell.)Changing my 4/5 Star to 1/2 star. After they moved server nodes and changed my SERVERs ip it has been giving me nothing but issues. Support Doesnt know their job most of the time. you have people int here that do (Very few) i will not be back AT ALL."

Will be moving forward with a chargeback for the total amount and updating the Attorney Generals office. Apparently its a bunch of 14-16 year olds scamming people. DONT BE FOOLED like I was. Im out $1800 because of this company!Update: Them saying the development work was completed is complete and utter lie. Cybergreen complained he had to much schoolwork to complete my server. So what did I pay $1300 for? Nothing. Had to start completely over. Do not trust!Update: cybergreen offered a refund of a one time payment of $496 then after he said he \"consulted a lawyer\" which I believe to be complete bs changed his mind and blocked me. I would love to know this companies attorney but they refused any information. I have updated the attorney general of New York and they did say my claim had merit. Just waiting on action now. Sad that this company thinks they can mess with money in these amounts and have no repercussions."

While they are cheaper, In my 6+ months of using them there were constant outings, and they even deleted my server \u201cbecause there was an issue with the rack it was on\u201d and then literally blamed me for not having a full backup of my 60+gb server. (I didn\u2019t back it up, 60gb s would have taken days because the server was so slow) From my research, rocketnode isn\u2019t even a legit business, they don\u2019t have a license and their about page has next to nothing on it. I wouldn\u2019t recommend using them to anyone, unless maybe it was a test server they did t really care about. The customer service can be helpful but otherwise I had nothing but hard aches from them."

I've heard from the people who bought priority support that it was a big waste of money so I recommend not adding it to your package as you will pretty much get the same support. But in general this is a very good host, you definitely can't go wrong with this one. I'll recommend searching for a host with more support if you're entirely new to making servers or whatever but for the people who are looking for a better host, this is probably your best choice!"
