Several months later I got an email saying it was ready to ship and that I needed to provide shipping details. At this time the company informed me that the amount charged through Kickstarter did not cover all necessary costs (Taxes) and that in order to receive the product I would need to send them more money. When I pushed back and pointed out that the additional amount did not even reflect the correct sales tax rate (it was about 1.5x higher) they stopped responding. I followed up asking for the rate to either be adjusted to match the correct tax rate or provide a refund for the money I had already paid. Again, no response from the company. At this point they have $1,000 of my money that they are refusing to either return to me or ship the agreed upon product unless I pay them additional funds that were never agreed upon. Very shady company."

There is no phone number and the people that reply seem to not even care to understand what the issue is. Terrible customer service, just the worse.

          "Contenu": "If you consider buying anything from the company MOMENT, please read first.Couple months ago I found that I\u2019m shooting a full length feature film this summer. I started prepping, testing various camera-lens combinations. I saw some tests online of the Moment Anamorphic Adapted I felt like it really suits me. Unfortunately nobody in Poland has one (as far as I know at least). So I decided to buy it. I placed the order for two pieces (the film will be shot on two cameras) on their official online store. It was March 21st. The information provided on their site said that for my location, the estimated shipping time is between 5 -7 days. I had packages sent from US before that took less than a week to arrive to Poland, so I was not surprised. After a week I started asking their customer service where the package is and why is there a delay. They kept finding different excuses every time. After about a month, I decided to cancel the order for one of the lenses, as I already knew I couldn\u2019t make it on time to do the proper testing before shooting. I made very clear not to send the refund through Google Pay, as it automatically exchanges USD to PLN, and the fees are huge. Instead I requested the refund to be made on my PayPal, or dollar account in my bank. They refused, and sent it through Google Pay anyway. In the meantime USD decreased a lot in value to PLN, so I lost twice. Yesterday after 63 days of waiting, a lot of money, and sanity lost in the proces I finally received the parcel. This is not about the quality of their product, but the absolut disregard, and disrespectful approach to the client. My goal is to warn everyone from ever buying anything directly from them, as you may likely find yourself in a similar situation."

I kept checking back periodically to see when the film would come back in stock until one day I checked and it wasn\u2019t even on the website anymore\u2026 I was never notified that they stopped selling it. I had to contact them myself to get the film switched out to something that would be in stock sooner and I was charged $15 for this.

My grandmother ordered a tripod from their site in November 2022 with the intention to give it as a Christmas gift. The item ended up being back ordered, so it was not delivered on Christmas, which is understandable. What is unacceptable is the complete lack of communication and customer service in the 5 months since ordering. Both my grandmother and I reached out for a total of 4 times to inquire about the status of the item and/or a refund with no response. Finally, on my 5th attempt to contact the company, I was informed that because the item was not in stock, we should receive a refund in maximum 10 business days. Now, over a month later, we still have yet to receive the refund leading me to reach out again. This entire process has been so frustrating, and I feel guilty for ever suggesting this company to my grandmother as I know it has caused her a lot of stress. After the 4th attempted contact with the moment team, I left a review on the product hoping to help others avoid the same situation. The review was never posted on their website. When I came here to review them, I thought I must have the wrong company due to all the positive reviews. Now I am wondering if these folks are friends, family, or paid reviewers.I generally try to be a kind and patient consumer and give grace to companies, but I am beyond fed up with my experience with Moment. Once they finally issue a refund, I suppose all is forgiven, but I will avoid having to shop here ever again, and will recommend the same to everyone I know."

(5 X 5 packs of portra 400 @ $62.99 a pack) I know that they have been back ordered for quite some time so I left a 6 week buffer which would ensure the film coming before I had to use it. At the end of December I saw that my film had still not shipped so I used the 'Chat' feature on the Moment website and spoke to a specialist. The specialist proceeded to tell me that all Kodak orders had recently been cancelled due to problems with the supplier and that I would be refunded my money. I had to reach out to them to get this information and I had not yet been notified that my film order had been cancelled. The specialist let me know that I was able to re-order the film at the new price ($72.99) and I wouldn't lose my spot in line for shipment. I decided to opt out since the price on these packs has increased by $20 USD over the past year and within 3 weeks my order had increased by $50. The final straw was that since I'm Canadian and was having the film shipped to Canada - when I was refunded by Moment I was refunded at the lower conversion rate from when I ordered the film in early December and lost another $35. So here I am, left with no film for my project and at a loss of $35. Safe to say I will definitely not be ordering from Moment again. I used to love this website but I'd way rather pay a little bit more for my film and support small local camera shops."

I received an email confirming shipment on Monday with two day shipping via Federal Express with expected arrival today (Wednesday).  When the order did not arrive as expected I checked the FedEx Tracking Number and FedEx says they have not received the package.  So I contacted Moment to inform them of the problem (via their chat).  I fully expected them to apologize for the inconvenience and promise to ship a replacement out right away (this is for a gift I need on Saturday and the fact I was going to receive it on Wednesday with a couple of days to spare is why I ordered what I did in the first place).  This is what I got instead. Even after repeatedly pointing out that FedEx says they never received the package and so the package is not in their system, I was told they would file an inquiry with FedEx and there was nothing that could be done until FedEx declared the package \u201clost\u201d.  Well I seriously doubt FedEx is going to own up to \u201closing\u201d the package if they say they never received it.So I am left with nothing.  I am confident my credit card company will take care of it since it is clear that I have not received anything.  But I am so disappointed in the level of customer service.  And the total lack of owning the problem, making it right first, and figuring it out with FedEx after satisfying the customer.First time I have ordered from Moment.  Most likely the last if this is any indication of how they deal with problems.  Deny it could be their fault.  Pass it on to someone else.  And then effectively tell the customer they will just have to be patient (while they already have the customer\u2019s money of course) until they can figure it out.  First rule of customer service is take care of the customer first and the rest takes care of itself.  I knew I should have ordered from Amazon.  Thought I would take a chance.  I am not afraid of owning up that I made that mistake."

This time it was a two day FedEx that was set to arrive and it was due 3/1. It is 3/4 as I type this and FedEx seems to be sending the package on the scenic route through California with only two scans saying where it was in 7 days. At this point I doubt I will see the package as it looks like it is headed back to the sender. Maybe I will just get my money back from the credit card since the item was supposed to arrive on 3/1 and I still keep getting text updates on 3/4 now that it will arrive by 8pm on 3/1. Now I need to know what year that will be. I just needed to replace a broken lens clip and buy some more overpriced goods. I had better luck getting their stuff through online marketplaces. But they strategically don\u2019t sell the parts necessary to make the lenses stay on through the easier method that delivers.I really just want what I ordered. I don\u2019t want to take my money back. It solves nothing to not have my order. But no one is giving me any answers that make sense since between where I live and the hubs are the weather has been fine for the time I ordered.

I have had stuff coming through customs arrive within less time from the time it shipped out the same day as pickup last week.I keep getting surveys about how they are doing and I cannot even give a review for anything done right. They contacted me about the issue and I gave a criticism that was not harsh, it was more of a question on why can\u2019t they make it easier on people with smaller orders to get items deployed faster through other methods they use. I get kind of a snarky answer back. Maybe don\u2019t ask for more info if you didn\u2019t like the original review.**I had reached out two days before this post went up.

Forgive me if contacting you back on this matter wouldn\u2019t feel like wasting my time again.Update: the order finally arrived after taking a tour of 3 different locations, according to the scans from FedEx it toured Cali for 2 weeks instead of the two business days. Not sure this is worth it for the prices of the gear when there is comparable gear out there without the hassle."

If you are an international buyer make sure you are 100% fine with your order, since after approx. an hour of submitting no modifications or cancellation will be allowed without additional costs. Before my items were shipped I contacted customer serice and almost begged them to cancel the order to avoid refunding complications, but they said they can't. The customer service was consistently before and after shipment not interested in meeting me half way, only referring to their page and asking if there's anything else they can help with.UPDATE:Thank you for the response. It will greatly help if you would provide me the information, so I can follow-up with the tax authorities. Specifically: 1) Which tax authority received the payment on my behalf 2) Any reference numbers helping to find the payment.Without these information I understandably can't get my payment back.

Not having a phone number to call and talk to a live person is a real problem. Everything has to be solved over e-mail, often with one or two day delays in each communication. Each time I got a different explanation. Finally I got the drop-in-mount so I can try the lenses I have had sitting around. Instructions are hard to find online despite the link given. I am still testing the lenses. In my first test under overcast skies in the forest I was getting consistent lens flares on both the fisheye and wide lenses. I am going to try again, but I was trying to shoot a natural bridge for which these lenses should be ideal, so more disappointment. My iPhone under the same conditions had no lens flares at all. The Macro has a very shallow depth of field and only focuses when the diffuser is basically touching the object. That is a bit disappointing. Maybe I should have read more closely. The Tele lens seems very good in my early uses. Filters seem high quality, but I have not yet tested the ND filters. First try on the CPL has me wondering. I can't see any difference at all when rotating, as I can on my DSLR. I will try again different circumstances. The lenses do not come with rear caps (really? who does that?), which cost $9.95 each. They come with a double-sided adhesive film which is near impossible to peel off without damaging. They send an extra film, presumably for this reason. Still, I failed to get 2 of 3 adhered properly. Moment sent replacements at no charge. The rear lens cap is the lowest quality item I purchased. It should come pre-assembled and free with the lens."

Holiday season, loads of orders, understandable!The problem comes when the shipment arrives into my country and gets stuck in customs. The reason being that the commercial invoice was missing. It is the duty of the seller to provide this documentation so that the custom clearance is seamless. I also tried to download the customer invoice from the website and upload, but that was also rejected by customs. I have mailed them (moment) and tweeted them about the problem, but there have been no response or resolution from their part till now. All I want is for them to submit the required documents that they forgot to submit when initiating the shipping. They should atleast have the courtesy to be careful about shipping the delayed orders so that these sort of further delays doesn't happen. I don't know how long this will take, or if I will even get my order.I will update the reivew if and when this is resolved."

Contacted FedEx and they confirmed that that was the only parcel in the shipment.It's nearly the end of the week and I've contacted Moment, and it's been 16 hours and I've received no reply so far. Surely missing 75% of my order is a more pressing issue than this? I was hoping to use my equipment this weekend, but now I'll have to wait at least another week. I'm not impressed.--------UPDATE: the items finally arrived a week later, but not without more issues and inaccurate information (including lies about attempted deliveries) from FedEx. However, the lens and equipment that I received were of pristine quality, and I know I'm going to enjoy using what I've received. Budget filmmaking, here we go.That being said, it's difficult for me to give the company a 5-star rating, because their choice of shipment fulfillment in the UK is dreadful. The sad fact is that I've now chosen to fill out the remainder of my Moment lens collection (Tele and Wide) with used lenses from eBay, rather than have to go through the ordeal with Moment (and more accurately, FedEx) directly. Its a little less reliable, and the selection is much less, but at least I don't have to sit at home and wait for 4 hours for a call from FedEx escalations team, followed by another 3 hours waiting by the front door."

          "Contenu": "This is my first time shopping with Moment. The online shopping and checking out process is user friendly and clear. I did have some issues with my order as the item was back-stocked. I was aware of this at the time of purchase and processed anyways as the website stated that the item was expected to be available in 1-2 weeks. Unfortunately this was not the case as it was 4+ weeks without stock being replenished. Unfortunately this held up my entire order which was quite frustrating as I needed it prior to a trip I had planned.I made a few efforts to contact someone at the moment team and they were all responsive but none able to provide me with much clarity on the matter or resolution to my order as it would have costed me extra to ship the products separately.  Eventually I reached out again because I hadn\u2019t gotten a response In 5 days from my last email to the company to follow up on my order. I was able to reach a gear guide named Szabolcs who was listened to my situation and worked with me to come up with a resolution. He personally followed up with me after our initial conversation to provide me with updates which was very much appreciated. If I\u2019m being honest my initial experience due to the length of delay and frustration experienced with my first few interactions (because no resolution was provided) was not great, despite everyone being very responsive (aside from that one email). Ultimately, I am very appreciative of the gear guide who was able to support me all the way. I don\u2019t have any comments about the gear or quality of stuff as I have yet to try it out. I am still giving a 4/5 because everyone was responsive and it\u2019s not their fault the item was not available. I would have appreciated if the company was a little more transparent with the length of delay rather than having the website say 1-2 weeks since that clearly was not the case.  Had I not attempted numerous times to follow up, the end outcome would have resulted in me not having my gear before my trip!"

One suggestion to the Moment team is to have an option to include a gift note at checkout, especially now that it's not so safe to visit people to hand them gifts personally. I asked about gift notes and gift wrapping via email and was answered promptly (within a day, thanks guys!). No gift note, but my friend got his photo kit gift very fast; good thing I let him know it was from me!"

They make one with charging built in, but I run power off my Pioneer along with the audio feed so that wasn't needed.Dinging 1 star because of the several days late arriving for no valid reason via FedEx which meant I didn't have my mount when I needed it. Having other carriers besides FedEx should be an option due to how awful they've been lately."

Probably it happens 30% of time but I don\u2019t know why the app freezes and close up? 3. I would like to chose from a variety of cases :)? And probably more resistance in the part that lens inserts?4. I would like to thank you for attending me quickly the last month when i have a break in my case and you give a chance of warranty :)!I think this is all, thank you for a good client service include my long distance in Per\u00fa ;) and the amazing lens that change my life very day!"

When new smart phones come out like new iPhones, the pre-order process is always lengthy.  I truly understand they are working hard to make the best products, but for the past couple of years it has been a case of \"over promise and under deliver\" in terms of pre-order shipping time.  Both in 2018 and 2019 my orders of new cases or lenses have been delayed by at least 2 months.  Again I totally understand that they are trying to make the best product. My only word of caution is that if you're pre-ordering a new product, don't expect the first shipping estimate to be accurate."

The customer service was actually really professional and polite, however I was disappointed by their response that was essentially \"not our problem, read our fine print\". I expected more as a first time customer going out on a limb buying their used gear thinking I was getting a good deal.That being said, the used 15mm fisheye lens I purchased is great, they got it to me super quick which is perfect for my trip to Chicago this week. I feel this is a way more fair review. I'm excited to give this lens a proper test drive out in chicago this week.Strong chance I'll be back to buy more. Their solid products out weighs my interaction with their customer service. I dig it."

Not a fault on Moment but I was a little annoyed that I couldn't change the delivery option to just leave it at my apartment without signiture. Package was delievered to a waiting area but since I was not back within 5 business days to pick it up. I had to rush and go across town to luckily pick it up and grab at the shipping center near the airport it before it was sent back to California.

          "Contenu": "I've gotten several lenses for my iPhone (macro and telephoto), a case, rear lens caps and a the 2 lens case as well as the ProCamera app.Here is a run down.I LOVE the lenses and the phone case.  The rugged leather case protects from drops, looks great and makes it easy to use the lenses.  The lenses themselves are top notch.  I'd like to see Moment come out with a telephoto lens that has more magnification.ProCamera app; I'm enjoying learning to use it and find it relatively intuitive.  I've never used any kind of manual camera before.I do wish the volume buttons worked as a shutter button.  They will, but they also change the volume at the same time and there is a delay before the picture happens which is hard to manage when hand shooting (v tripod).  There is also the same sort of delay with a remote I purchased.  Since neither of the delays happens in the native camera app I imagine it has to do with programing and what permissions Apple gives out.I also had some bugs but those seem to have resolved with iOS 14.3.Rear Lens caps;  Directions tell me to center the sticky end on the front lens cap.  This doesn't work for the telephoto lens.  There isn't enough slack in the strap.  I'd also like a tab with better purchase so that I can flip the rear lens cap off with one hand.2 lens case;  I find this useful but only use the velcro to secure it to my belt.  The snap closure suggested for use on a belt does not hold at all.All in all I am very happy with the Moment and the lens/case system they have works great."

          "Contenu": "4 stars because the Android app is no longer supported.Apart from that, it's 5/5 all the way in terms of the hardware and results. The lenses are solid metal and glass, they are sturdy, and produce great images! The case is also very well constructed and I use it even when I'm not out taking photos. The lenses all twist on easily and firmly, with no fear of them falling off or coming lose  even if you turn the phone upside down or sideways. It is SUPER EASY to carry around and takes up virtually no space at all. I can easily fit all three lenses in their little pouches in my pocket and swapping them in and out with one another is simple and quick. This is a great way to take better-than-average photos, quickly and easily, without having to haul lots of gear around or spend tons of money on said gear. Individual lenses review:* 10x macro - BEAUTIFUL close-up shots and when you combine it with the phone's digital zoom you basically have a microscope in your hands! Try shooting the inside of flowers or small insects or moss, it's amazing. * 58mm - Basically a 2x optical zoom with no vignette and virtually zero distortion. Excellent for birdwatching and nature scenery. * Anamorphic 1.33x - Works wonderfully, just make sure you have video software installed on your computer or your phone to \"desqueeze\". On the super-cheap side you can just export your images and multiply length or width (but not both) by 1.33 to de-squeeze and you'll be set to go.Summary: Overall I am very satisfied with this product in all regards, I just with the Moment App was still under development for Android phones."

In the late 1990s, I started building digital darkrooms and shooting the first digital cameras.  iPhones eventually became seen everywhere and I drooled over better and better camera sensors.  Now, because of Moment, I can shoot pro quality images on my phone!  You should give it a try.  They are relatively inexpensive so if you have an iphone or android phone, why not contact Moment and purchase one lens.   You will start having a lot more fun with your phone."

I reached out to support staff and asked if they could separate my order so the non back ordered items could get here on time. I got a response email saying they could fulfill me request and truly made my day. 14 out of 10 would recommend the lenses and overall service with moment."

I reached out to moment, and received a response within about an hour. They asked for proof of purchase, as well as a video of the faulty part. Upon sending it to them, I received another timely response, saying they would be happy to send me a new part for free, and to expect a tracking number soon. They were very helpful, and this has been one of the best customer service experiences I\u2019ve ever had. Well done moment."
