Even though I had requested service previously, I am absolutely no longer wishing to to be contacted by this \"business\" again.

Read: 5 missed appointments on their behalf. What. A. Waste. Of. Time. I'll be calling 1800 Got Junk who can come within a couple hours of me calling very reliably. Their team is professional and courteous unlike the folks at Dimension. At Dimension, you aren't paying the provider for a service. You're paying them to find a provider for you. Unfortunately, they have unreliable providers in their network and they seem to think it's a good idea to let a provider with only 1 service experience in their lifetime repeatedly cancel on me \"due to emergency\".This company doesn't even fulfill it's most basic premise of removing junk, even after doubling the asking price. Use Got Junk or any other Googled \"junk removal\" provider and you'll be much happier."

Then they had the audacity to ask me for additional money, even though the order itself had not changed. They said their supplier wanted more money. That isn\u2019t my problem. They had already quoted me a price and I paid and they wasted my entire day. How can they even think for a moment they should ask me for additional money?  Very unprofessional fly-by-night company and I do not recommend. If anything they should have discounted my order but they only offered a $10 discount on a $300 order! I regret ever using them. FYI, on the second day, they actually did send someone to do the pick up and he was fabulous but I still would not use Dimension again because of what happened the day prior and how they handled a bad situation. Horrendous customer service, and unreliable vendors, who appear to be independent contractors. Would be surprised if this company stays in business. Don\u2019t waste your time."

I stand by my statement, they didn\u2019t honor the contract and only refunded me based on the agreement I\u2019d change my review. Look up the previous company name on BBB if you\u2019d like, but I\u2019m not about to help the sku reviews. This was a nightmare that ended costing my a huge trickledown effect."

This process took three days, and I am still waiting for a valid confirmation email that our money will be returned to us. Long story short, don't bother with them & take your money elsewhere."

          "Contenu": "I booked a pickup job with a larger-sized truck for $99 on the website. Upon uploading photos of all items to be picked up, the quote didn't change from $99.On the day of pickup, the warrior cleared out the items in under 30 minutes. The warrior did a quick and clean job of removal, so my complaint isn't with him.At the end of the job, I received an invoice for an additional $900 on top of the original quote. They didn't update the quote when I sent photos of the items. They didn't update the quote upon arrival of the warrior. They only updated it once all work was done and they had the ability to effectively just pick a number.Plain and simple, this is fraudulent billing and will probably lead to the company ceasing to exist eventually. They refuse to address the issue through support, so I'm forced to file a chargeback with the bank and waste more of my time.UPDATE 2022-11-23: The company acknowledged that the operational mistake was on their end, and that someone should have reached out to discuss amended pricing before the booking based on the photos I uploaded. However, because they still have to pay the provider, they still want me to pay $650 for the job despite the estimate being $99. They see no issue with making this request despite acknowledging the fault was their own."

I told him that I would not pay $150 more and he started to explain that he would pick up everything and that it was at a reasonable price because he was only being paid $40 to do the job. I agreed to pay him $100 more and he stated that it was fine. Willie arrived late and tried to only pick up half of what was agreed upon. I reminded him what we had spoken about and he stated that he would not be taking anything for that price. I advised him that I would not be paying more and he started taking the item along with the lady with him out of the trailer and tossing them back. He stated that I must be crazy if I thought he was going to take all of the items for $100. Then the lady stated that we used up all her Fuc*** gas for nothing.  I tried reaching out Trash Warrior and am still waiting for a reply."

          "Contenu": "Copy of my complaint belowI booked an appointment last week for $72. A day later someone called me to tell me that job had an extra charge of $200, immediately I rejected the estimate and asked the agent to cancel the order and issue a refund.I had used trash warrior in the past and the experience had always been extremely convenient and price competitive. Not even 6 months ago I was charged less than that to empty an entire 1 apartment. A couple of years ago I used one of your competitors Dolly for a move and they charged less than $100 to empty and load a 3 bedroom house. Yesterday I received a message saying my job was confirmed. I contacted your team to ask? And they confirmed the job was cancelled and the refund authorized (screenshot attached). By the way, I already had the job done by one of your competitors for $55.Today I got an email confirming my refund of $65. Receipt #3250-6988So if I understood this correctly, this is how things work with Dimension: I book a job and I got to the trouble of getting approval from the condo, schedule the service elevator, pay my deposit to the condo etc. Next you more than triple the original estimate and I reject the quote for obvious reasons and ask you to cancel and return my money. You fail to do so and I have to contact you again. And after all this I get charged $7. So in summary, you advertise a price, then you triple it and you still charge a fee to customers that don't accept your scam, am I right? I will be posting this review in every possible site I find to warn others not to fall for your scams. And obviously I want my $7 backThanks and have a good day.EDIT: they replied to the complain posted here with an apology but they still kept the stolen $7."

I helped him get the copier down the stairs, I helped him get it out the door, I helped him load it into his truck (where I also cut my finger wide open). Not to mention, he came in my house with dogsh*t on the bottom of his shoes, so I had to track down everywhere he walked and clean it.The guy was nice, but he came ill-prepared for the job. I have asked for a 50% refund but now they have stopped responding. Hell, I didn't even ask for 100% because he did take the copier away. I only asked for 50%. They can't even do that right!BEWARE of this company and if a single dude shows up to do a multiple man job, I would send him packing before he touches a thing.I'm pretty sure this company is being operated from overseas, as well. They may have a San Francisco, CA corporate address but they keep odd hours and no one EVER picks up the phone (not even sure it's dialing them, to be honest). They don't respond to their \"support\" email either. I should have done my homework...Hopefully, I can save YOU, a headache!UPDATE: I STILL HVE NOT RECEIVED MY PARTIAL REFUND (50%)."

It took a complaint to the California Attorney General's office to get a response in the first place, so I guess the only way this company is willing to rectify their mistakes is by making you go to the top. AVOID!!!! THEY WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY WITHOUT RENDERING SERVICE AND REFUSE REFUNDS. CUSTOMER SUPPORT WILL GHOST YOU.Would you use Uber/Lyft if they weren't able to find you a driver but still charged you? No? Then read on about why you should avoid Trash Warrior.Most of the positive reviews are about the contractors Trash Warrior finds. The negatives, including this one are about Trash Warrior themselves.Put an order in with this service, and my card was charged upfront over $400+. No warrior was found or matched to my request as per the email received. They asked me to wait an hour before offering a free reschedule or a cancelation. I waited for over an hour. No response from customer service at all.Due to the speed at which I needed a job done and as how Trash Warrior still had not found a \"warrior\" at this time or notified me with any update, I requested a cancelation as i found a local company willing to take the rush job (for less I might add). Although the cancelation was granted (still no warrior found) I was still charged 75%.This means that Trash Warrior took over $300+ for no services rendered. It's one thing if they had found a contractor and I canceled - I would pay that fair enough - but to charge me, not be able to render the promised service, and still charge me 75% of the bill is ludicrous and anti-consumer, if not straight up theft. Follow ups to the internationally based customer service team and the CEO on linkedin were met without adequate resolution. I unfortunately had to report these fraudulent actions to my states Consumer Complaints division.Unethical and malicious at worst, woefully incompetent at best. Use a local company, not Silicon Valley funded middlemen \"disrupting\" industries that don't need to be disruspted.TLDR: Trash Warrior charged me, were unable to render service, ghosted me, and when I canceled they were happy to charge me 75%."

          "Contenu": "We paid $720 for a 10-day, 20-yard dumpster rental to be delivered Saturday, 2/18/23 at 9AM. At 9:30AM, we called dimension because we didn't receive the dumpster.  Karen at dimension was polite, but she was the first person to let us know the delivery time is actually a 3-hour window. This was not communicated when we inquired nor when we paid. Karen called the provider, found out they had a problem with their truck, and asked if we could change the delivery date to Monday, 2/21 instead. This was not an option because we needed the holiday weekend to work on a time sensitive project. Karen ultimately offered a provider who could deliver a dumpster between 3 and 6PM on Saturday, but their dumpster was only available until Wednesday and they delivered at 5:35PM.   So, our 10-day booking was cut in half and we lost the first full day of work. I asked about having the rate adjusted and Karen assured us management would be apprised of the issues with our booking and would reach out to us to resolve the rate issue.The following Monday (2/21), Greg\u00a0Llavore, Jr. (Sales Development Rep we booked with) sent a generic email stating he was doing a \"courtesy follow-up to check on [our] appointment\" and enlisted us to contact him directly for additional bookings in the future. This struck us as an odd approach to resolve issues we thought he'd be aware of. I sent a detailed email about what occurred and directly asked about the rate being adjusted since we paid for 10 days but had the dumpster for less than 5 full days. Greg offered a 15% refund and a discount on a future booking. This offer is not acceptable, which I communicated to Greg. In response, Greg said this was the best they could do due to\u00a0\"minimum fees in the recycling facility and\u00a0landfill\" and contended we weren't charged for 10 days since we asked for a quote for 7 days initially. I replied expressing my confusion about the fees mentioned when their Corporate Service Agreement states dimension does not provide waste management or function as a waste management carrier.  Their agreement states the services they offer are use of the tech platform which connects customers with waste management providers. I also sent him the 7-day quote he originally provided, which was less than $720 and again indicated a 15% discount is not an acceptable rate reduction when our rental was for less than half the time we paid for. To add insult to injury, I was issued a $90 refund to my payment method, which is less than 15% of $720.I requested to correspond with a different member of the management team and received no response.  I reached out via the dimension chat feature on the website on 2/24 and corresponded with an agent named Jhicko who said they'd help. They only confirmed my email address and I still have not heard back from management. It has been over 2 weeks since we informed Greg of the booking issues and he has not resolved our issues satisfactorily.The stars are for the provider we ended up with; Jaymes was professional and communicative. I cannot say the same for dimension. I would not book with dimension in the future due to the failure to communicate or resolve the issues with our booking satisfactorily."

I received a text 4 hours prior, that my driver would be arriving within 30 minutes of the scheduled pick-up time of 10AM.  Unfortunately, the driver was still not at my home at 11:20AM.  I messaged Dimension to let them know.  They were quick to respond and connect with the driver.  Ten minutes later Dimension responded that the driver was having vehicle problems and was waiting on a mechanic.  They did not know when they would arrive specifically but would complete the job before 7PM.  A little frustrated to find this out I expressed my concern that we were inconvenienced waiting for the scheduled pick-up.  I explained that I would leave the mattress for pick-up outside.  Dimension acknowledged the outside pick-up and apologized for the delay.  At 2:35PM the driver called and said he was pulling up.  He was polite and friendly over the phone.  He collected the mattress and was professional in-person.  Other than the slight mishap waiting for our driver we would recommend Dimension for their service."
