That's when I requested the refund because I became frustrated"

Not only do they keep 20% of your money, they also make you pay to return the faulty products that they sell. It is honestly not even worth the hassle. Your best bet is to not waste your time, or hard earned money with a company this difficult to deal with, who essentially charges you for the hassle they cause."

With Newegg, Amazon, Titan Rig and even Aquacomputer, I can just put in my info, click \"place order\" and rest assured that my items will arrive. With PPCS, there's always at least one major inconvenience or problem I have to troubleshoot on their behalf. Why is such a simple and obvious process so difficult for PPCS? Why haven't these glaring issues been fixed? PPCS has had years to fix them, yet nothing has changed. There are no excuses for these types of problems in 2022."

It is refreshing to have a company go out of their way to make things right. I would purchase from them again without hesitation. Customer service, after the sale, is what matters and they have that in spades. Kudos to the entire team that assisted me.Update as of March 1, 2022.My account was cancelled due to exposing misleading Free Shipping promos.A Zebra cannot change it stripes. This holds true more than ever now. Several times,I called out Performance on their misleading Free Shipping promotion and was met with excuse after excuse as to why I didn't qualify.

The same day I ordered additional parts from Amazon, 2 day ground shipping coming out of Atlanta Georgia. Those parts arrived three days later. Total time from order to arrival from performance pc out of florida will be 10 days. Companies that can't compete price wise should just go out of business or just pay Amazon's fees. You are a burden to us all. I would have ordered several other products from performance-pcs until I saw in the shopping cart that they were going to charge me shipping for each product.

I don't think I've encountered pages that load that long since dial-up days decades ago.The organization is very poor, I could not figure out how to find things without pasting the full product name into search bar. Oh, and every time you do that, the search bar loses focus and randomly scrolls you somewhere to the middle of the page.The fact that every click results in sometimes up to 30 seconds of page load time totally does not help.I want to add that I have a gigabit fiber internet connection and everything else is blazingly fast. The point is that my internet connection is not the issue here.When ordering parts that could include additional sleeving service, even when you choose \"no sleeving\", all the sleeving options still persist on the product and get dragged into cart leaving the impression that you've actually ordered them.I was also expecting free shipping when ordering almost $1k worth of parts, but that was not an option apparently.American express didn't work on checkout with a simple message along the lines of \"try different payment method\", so I end up paying with the same american express card through paypal."

I informed PPCS that it looked like i was accidentally sent something that had been returned, but PPCS claimed it was EK's fault. Now I am stuck waiting for my RMA to return the items and get my refund causing me to push my build back. UpdateReceived an email from PPCS saying they were sorry for what happened and wanted to make it right. They offered a discount on the next order, so I decided to give them another chance. When I went to place my order I entering the discount code and it removed my free shipping. I contacted PPCS about this and they said they don't offer free shipping if they give a discount code. BUT if I change my negative review they would see what they could do for me. I did receive my refund for the reservoirs I returned.I find it hard to believe that EK would send 2 miss packaged items. 1 of them I am positive was a used return as the threads had slight damage. As far as stacking shipping and the coupon I have an email that states \"if you are willing to revise the review you left, we would gladly wave the shipping fee\". This considered are you lying in your reply or did your employee lie in his email to try to force a good review?  I had planed to change my review pending how you handled my new order and would have gladly given a good review. I would like to ad that the 2 radiators I had in the same order did come in good condition so I was just unlucky in the fact I had issues with the other part of the order."

If you need the item(s) right away you are out of luck.  I thought about ordering my defective/incorrect items from another company and just get a refund from Performance PC.  This way I could cut down the amount of time I had to wait by avoiding having to wait the time for my return shipping and their processing time.  However, if they issue a refund, even on items they shipped incorrectly and on defective parts, they charge you a 15% restocking fee.\r That\u2019s right, when they make a mistake \u2013 they still charge you a 15% restocking fee.  Make you pay return shipping and make you wait an extra long time or pay a 15% restocking fee.\r This isn\u2019t a company you should do business with \u2013 avoid them.  They have absolutely no concern for their customers and absolutely don\u2019t treat their customers fairly.  Do NOT do business with them at any cost.  I\u2019ll bet they will soon be out of business given their very poor customer policies."

However just my luck the parcel is lost and I had purchased the last of the stock available. What annoys me the most is you didnt even bother to offer me anything for the inconvenice caused, I had to fork out almost \u00a367 on a new CPU block becuase of this and now I have to sell my old XSPC block to make up for the cost.Losing the parcel isnt your fault but you are partially to blame for not taking ownership and giving me options other than a bog standard refund. How about a discount on an AM4 block to make up for my parcel being lost as a goodwill gesture?This was my first and will be my last order with your company.In response:In one of my responses after the parcel was lost I specially asked if there was a possibility if you could source stock elseware as I didnt want to buy a new block, obviously if i can\u2019t find a suitable AM4 replacement from another vendor I need a new block right?. So how you can say I did not give you any indication of this is a complete lie. Are all your advisors robots? Its due to this and my experience that im not changing my review or rating.Final editAfter checking my email correspondance I sent you a final email on 27/05/2020 which you didnt bother to respond to asking where my refund was becuase I needed to buy a new block. If that wasnt indication that I was after one at that point I don\u2019t know what is.As per my previous edit I am not changing this review, you did nothing to keep me as a customer."

This is not the first time this has happened. Not cool and not this time. I am fed up because this has happened before. Always a different excuse. Try to keep a customer and stop the B.S. I requested a cancellation if I do not get this rectified. This is shady business practice. TitanRig is a direct competitor and do not play such bait and switch tactics with free shipping. FREE SHIPING MEANS FREE SHIPPING!!! ARE YOU LISTENING PERFORMANCE PCs? STOP THE BAIT AND SWITCH.This is a reply to the reply.As a consumer and reseller, we should not have to read fine print and jump through hoops in order to get an offer that is displayed so large that even Stevie Wonder can see it. The banner on your site \"Free Shipping\" is the size of a \"Bulletin Board\" and the \"fine print\" is 2 clicks away. Too many rules and policies that disqualify \"Free Shipping\". Your company can call it policies and sugar coat it but it is a \"Bait and Switch\" The main issue is that your website and cart show free shipping up until the last minute and only after the purchase is completed, is the overpriced shipping \"slipped\" in \"after the fact \"and added to the purchase. I hope other customers will see this and take notice. Perhaps then change will occur, with regard to the misleading nonsense, and be a bit more clear and straight forward. I would venture a guess that 99% of your sales DO NOT get Free Shipping because of your Bait and Switch \"Policies\".Update: Performance PCs cancelled my account because I went and wrote this review and exposed their Bait and Switch B.S. Their are other retailers that are offer legit perks to loyal customers.A threat of chargeback is more dancing around the real reason. You did not like my exposing the Free Shipping smoke show. All good. There is no shortage of other retailers. Consider modifying Website to be more transparent with your so called Free Shipping and everyone wins. I took the hit for the team in hopes it will be rectified."

USPS has no statement of suspension of money back guarantee for this service during Covid, with shipping from US to Canada. When asked to file for the money back due to the shipment taking over 15 days they refuse and give the base attitude of its not their problem. Overall Attitude makes me think they got the refund from USPS and pocketed it. I spent $57.65 USD to express ship the package to get the parts before school started in 3 weeks from the shipment. I will already be in school without the required gear. Never had a worse experience with an on line transaction, than i have had with this. Avoid this Store at all costs, because one you pay they couldn't care less where your package is, if you get it or not. Once you pay its your problem not theirs.Update Response to Performance PC's Reply: Yes you did have your rep contact USPS to further push the investigation into my package that had been marked as processed through international distribution facility with not further scans indicating it ever left as i found out when i, initiated the investigation process after USPS had the Package for 14 days on a 3 to 5 day shipping method. Now 19 days after USPS had the package and after I had to contact you to get you to reach out on the missing package; it finally shows up in Customs in Canada. I never said your company said the package wast your problem, but that is the attitude that your contact portrays when you say the suspension of certain parts of the shipping service guarantee are in effect and i can find no such information or warning from USPS to confirm that, even after dealing with a USPS representative on the phone.  The 15% discount you gave me on the order for this experience is appreciated but a drop in the bucket compared to the money spent on the shipping charges for a method that took over 3 times the maximum delivery date by method stated standards. I am not blaming Performance PC's for the short comings of USPS. I am blaming you for making me feel as if my desire to seek the money back function of the shipping method that USPS would only refund to the Shipper and not the Recipient was taken as a joke based on you hiding behind \"all carriers are experiencing delays and all money back guarantees have been suspended since the beginning of the COVID outbreak\" line used repeatedly. If i had been told that they were supposed to be suspended but you would process the request to USPS for me and see what they say i would have felt that Performance PC's appreciated and valued my business. The Discount code you gave me for my next future order with Performance PC's wont be used. As it sits right now i see no reason to place another order with your company. This experience has left a bad taste in my mouth and it will be a long time before i decide to give your company a chance at any repeat business."

It has nothing to do with us as we did not charge you.\"\r ME: \"in order for them to release the authorization, you have to contact them to let them know the sale did not go through... here is Amscot's phone number: 1-866-532-9623\r OR\r The system kicked back the payment because of the billing address, which I have just recently moved, so the thing is that I cannot reenter the billing address because the money I had loaded is now locked... I have just changed the address that amscot has on file, so if you were to rerun the order under the initial authorization would that work?  Amscot replied that you have 7 days to claim the authorization.  the previous billing address is as follows:\r XXXXXX XXXXX\r XXXX S. Kirkman Rd.  XXXX\r Orlando,  FL  XXXXX\r the new billing address is: (the one I entered on your site)\r XXXXXX XXXXX\r XXX One Center Blvd.  XXXX\r Altamonte Springs, FL  XXXXX\r Any alternative strategies you may have would be welcome.\r Thanks for you time,\"\r THEM: \"We just do not have the time to do this, sorry.\"\r ME: \"Thanks.  You have just lost a customer.  Your customer service is worthless and I intend to make it known on every forum I frequent and the BBB.  No reply necessary; all of your future correspondence will rot in my spam folder.\"\r THEM: \"Grow up. BBB you don't even have an order ...lol\"\r ME: \"Ummm, I have credit card transaction records... which are more than enough.  Btw since your lol-ing, you may have never looked at your BBB score, but it sucks.  No wonder all the complaints seem to relate to your customer service.  Just to give you and Henry W. Baron a quick heads up, but your competition (FrozenCPU) has an A+ and your company has a C-.  The only reason I was doing business with you guys is because you are physically close to my location, in fact, my last order I picked up from your warehouse in person.  Are you Mr. Baron?  Do you think that he would be happy to read a transcript of this email exchange?  Do you think he may be able to figure out which one of his CSR's was responsible?\"\r THEM: \"' all of your future correspondence will rot in my spam folder.'\r  We cant reply to this because it is in the SPAM box too.\"\r I will be the first to admit, I got pretty angry, but since when is it ok for a CSR to essentially say ~eh, you don't have an order number so, up yours. After trying to patronize this store, I did not receive an order, I was out $150 for at least a week (we will see how fast amscot will default the authorization, but history tells me it will be a week), and I was treated by Cust.serv. like I was a joke and not worth their time.  I can just hope that someone may read this and decide to go to FrozenCPU or Xoxide instead."

So far they have had a 100% failure rate over three orders (on several accounts over the last decade), where something was screwed up in them.As per usual, PPC's support is top quality, working quickly and efficiently to solve the issue, understand the issue immediately with no need to repeat myself, and always have made good on the issues, with no extra expense to the customer. They also have on two occasions of the three (that I know of) ensured the replacement was checked before being sent, which actually avoided an issue with a new factory-defective part being shipped in this order.I commend their support, but its a shame that I have had to go through them every single time I have ordered from PPC's.

          "Contenu": "The website seems to be riddled with problems. From being very slow to the whole checkout process. I was buying two vandal proof switches. The only payment option I was given was to check out with Amazon. OK, I am a Prime member so not that big of a problem. there are a lot of choices for shipping and I choose the least expensive via USPS and checked off the box. On the order total side of the screen my shipping preference came up and it said $0.00 charge. I thought it must be because I paid with Amazon my free shipping carried over. Nope. As soon as I confirmed payment A new total screen appeared and said I had just paid for the switches and over $14 to ship them. That was more than 50% of the price of my order.I immediately called Performance PC's toll free number and left a message with customer service to call me back. To their credit they did just a couple minutes later. I explained my problem and was told I did check the box for the more expensive shipping. I disagreed, and told the CS rep the first time I saw that shipping charge was after I placed my order. He then suggested that the price jumped to a more expensive method because the shipping choice I made was not available where I live. I said that's ridiculous. It's the US Post Office, it comes to the house every day. I was put on hold while he went to talk with the shipping manager. A minute or two later he returned and told me because I lived in a rural area (I don't) the post office charges more and the price jumped because they could not send this less than a pound package out for the  $6.70 the shopping cart calculated, because of course, the \"rural\" area I live in. The deal I was offered was they will have to mail out my switches in a bubble envelope (I thought that was how it would come anyway) and charge me $7.70 postage and then refund the difference. I agreed and we said goodbye.I have since looked this up and PPC's $7.70 shipping cost is about right. Had the website given that price I would have groused about the USPS but paid it and been on my way. To many people (myself included most of the time) Tennessee is rural and it could be that the Post Office does indeed charge more to deliver here, I feel the shipping calculator on anybody's website should be accurate and if not the merchant should honor that price. I have never agreed to pay for something and had the price jump after the deal was sealed.I have bought from Performance PC's in the past and never had a problem and I will use them again in the future I'm sure. If this had been my first experience though, I do not think I'd be back. The new site design maybe should have been beta tested a little more."

          "Contenu": "Everything I ordered came packed well and all the water cooling parts had zero leaks. The reason I gave 3 stars for this shipment is because there were fingerprints all over the radiators I bought and dust/debris over all the boxes. I ordered the EK quantum surface radiators in black and had all 3 of them custom painted with the powder coating service they provide. The powder coating itself is pretty good but has some flaws. It isn't as good as some local powder coating jobs I've seen. But my issue was that since they do this service themselves, it seems when they are handling the radiators they do not use gloves. Being a professional reseller I figured this would be standard. Or at least clean the radiators before you send them off because it was pretty hard to clean the fingerprints after they had all that time to really stick to the sides of the radiators. Maybe I'm just being picky but I'm someone who always handles my PC components with gloves to avoid fingerprints. Also one of the x360 radiators I got has these streaks on the side that won't come of even when I clean them. Almost like scratching. I'm not sure if this was from the EK factory or this was caused by improper handling of the radiators. It's on both sides and if the fingerprints are anything to guess from I'd say it's improper handling. Anyway once cleaned the radiators looked pretty good other than those streaks."

I selected rush order and was charged for it. Over 24 hours later, I was contacted by a representative explaining that despite being list as having several in stock, that one of my items was not in stock. I was told I could have the rest of my order shipped immediately, then have the remaining item shipped within the next day or two. After asking some info, I agreed to this. However, it took the representative over another 24 hours to respond confirming this, then they did not ship anything from my order another 24 hour period, which led to a severely inconvenient delay for me. While once shipped the parts arrived fast and in great condition, it took over 72 hours for them to process and ship what was promised to be a rush order, when their normal non-rush processing period is listed as 24 hours. I understand things happen, but the fact they advertise this is a bit misleading. Also, I was not refunded my rush order charge, despite the fact that the agreement in the purchase states it will be refunded if the order is not processed within 24 hours. So this left a sour experience on what was otherwise a great website and purchasing experience. If not for this delay, I would have given 5 stars, so your experience, especially if you do not need your items immediately, will probably be great."

I will continue to use PPCS in the future, but they definitely need to update the site. A mobile friendly site or app would help too.EDIT: Good to hear the issues are being worked out.

Fortunately, I detected the issue, and they immediately sent the correct size tubing, at no further cost. So, this is a mixed review, in this instance. But I believe this type of problem is easy in a warehouse, where this tubing is snipped from various large rolls -- easy to misplace or mistake -- rather than individually labeled packages. So, my review is somewhere between one-star and five-stars. (!) I figure they'll now instruct their warehouse employees. Everything else about the order was great."

I'm not going to return it because I can hide the white radiator down below the PSU shield. Overall I had a great experience, my order arrived when they said it would and everything works great. I plan on making another purchase as soon as they get the two Pump/Res combos I need to finish my Lian Li V3000 Plus dual loop build.

So I was unable to use the conserve function which is the reason I buy these. I know exactly how to set these up and use them as I already had 2 of them. So this one was malfunctioning, which is no fault of the seller. All the units I bought here had slightly leaking batteries though, which is odd that all of them would. But, I simply put fresh batteries in them-not a huge deal. I live in Canada so it would have been such a bother to return the one that wasn't working.

I WILL say that I had to pull one of the \"hook\" screws at the top and tap down the locking washer into the panel and reinsert the screw to get it to attach so the top was flush so I can secure my top panel over it. Also, the front panel is roughly 1mm too thick and sticks out from the front of the case where my front buttons/ports are. I imagine I misread the description, I thought I would have brackets to attach fans and not just holes drilled in the front panel. I was a bit disappointed there. Still happy with the panel! It's better than having solid glass on the front."

The box came slightly damaged, which could be the carriers fault. But as a guy who like to hold onto boxes for future resale/trades is kind of an inconvenience. Haven\u2019t tested the Radiator yet, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just box damage, the Rad looks damage free.Another minor thing, I did wish they sent a separate email for just a receipt link like other sites have; Instead of having to screenshot it from the website. No that easy to find. I could recommend them tho."

Only issue is that Fed Ex picked up the package it then quickly shipped it back and forth between multiple locations and at one point said they couldn't track it.  A message, even automated from Performance PCs would have alleviated my stress on whether or not there was a real issue from the company side versus Fed Ex shipping being crazy.  I will definitely order from Performance PC again!"

Nothing. :( They also gave me my \"reward points\" for the original order, then took them back, and have yet to give me the ones for the new order.
