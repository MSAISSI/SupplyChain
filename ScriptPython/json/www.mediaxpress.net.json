Very plausible Customer Service exchange of Emails which ceased as soon as I had paid and then when notified of dispute, Cameraboxuk site removed.What ever the bargain do not use.ADDENDUM: For the purposes of clarity, the above refers to two websites in the Uk whose Contact Details stated that they are situated in Farnborough, Hampshire, UK, and nowhere else that I am aware of."

I was able to print on my own discs for the three I needed so it worked out. I thought it might be the duplicater so after just having another project to burn about 50 discs I used our normal falcon media DVDs and had zero error out. I'm concerned about the quality of DVDs from media express."

When I first called to ask questions, the person who answered - I think Matt? - seemed to be annoyed to have to talk to me, and told me to just go on the website so he wouldn't have to answer my questions. After I placed my order, they sent me a PDF with my cover design and it looked fine. When I actually received the CDs, the image (originally black and white) was very green. If I were more professional, I probably wouldn't have wanted to sell them. However, since I'm an indie musician, I decided it wasn't the end of the world. As per the title, their service could have been worse, but next time I will choose a different provider."

          "Contenu": "Overall, I am very satisfied with my experience working with MediaXpress on my CD duplication project. MediaXpress staff members are readily available for phone conversations and extremely friendly and helpful. MediaXpress.net is not a flashy website, but it's clean and generally simple to use for order placement. I had no difficulties ordering exactly what I wanted, and the CDs met all of my expectations for both the appearance of the artwork and the accuracy of the audio. I especially like that throughout the online ordering process, the cost of the project is continuously updated in real time based on the purchaser's choices (e.g., add UPC code vs. don't need one).However, there are two improvements that should be made to MediaXpress.net:1. Some of the instructions regarding how to format, save, and submit graphics files are a bit out of date. The instructions could use a revamp to be more reflective of current graphics software and formatting options.2. The order status checking option on the website isn't helpful. In my case, once I placed the order, my order status just continuously read \"processing\" throughout the week it took for the order to be completed, right up until the moment when a staff member called me to say the order was ready for pickup. That doesn't really qualify as order status tracking. This feature should either be modernized to give actual status updates or removed from the site to avoid causing frustration. (IMPORTANT NOTE: None of the above should be taken as a complaint about the one-week turnaround time. That is exactly the timeframe I was quoted by a staff member on the phone, so no worries there at all. I was only bothered by the unavailability of true order status checking.)"
