          "Contenu": "Read the other 1 and 2-star reviews here. They also manually charged my credit card without my authorization. I'm in the middle of reporting this and uploading supporting docs to relevant authorities. They refused to refund the transaction and FIRST discuss the amount due, since I had already paid $16.15 the day before. As such I requested that they close and cancel my account, to which they said they have to send me a confirmation email first. However, to manually run my credit card for an amount that leaves credit on my account, they did not email me first to authorize it. Terrible customer service at best, and possible illegal handling of customer and payment data. Will continue to get to the bottom of this as I find others with similar experience."

          "Contenu": "UniTel Voice's level of service is well above any other company. They do not have all the features some of the big players have, but they make up for it with the fact that they truly try to find a workable solution to any problem I have. UniTel's staff values my company and proves it by taking any problem or concern I have as seriously as I do. I actually had started to transfer my numbers out after being sold on bad information and nonexistent features by Nextiva. Mid-transfer I reversed the move as I realized that UniTel was more responsive and helpful with me leaving than Nextiva was at migrating in my numbers as a new customer. UniTel does it the right way whether the customer is onboarding or switching to a competitor. That statement alone shows they do care, and in today's world that is near impossible to find."

UniTel not only had all of the features we were looking for, but it had them at a significantly lower price than their competitors. What I didn't expect is the quality of services I've received since joining. I've reached out to their support team and communicated with multiple representatives during the process of setting up our account. They were all incredibly knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly. They were even willing to set it all up for me over the phone. This may sound too good to be true but take it from someone that did a lot of research and has a business that's centered around high quality customer service, UniTel Voice is the best VoIP provider you will find."

Well, I must admit I had such low expectations when I first contacted them about getting a business line number. So many products and services to choose from in the marketplace. However, after going on their website, it was quite easy to open up your account and choose a number. Then, I reached out to them via email. I explained to them that I need help retrieving my 1-800 number and setting up my extensions. Then this happened; I got a phone call from one of the representatives. I explained my dilemma. He immediately set up a time and day for me to speak with someone to help me. Frank, the tech, called me and walked me through the whole process and set up everything to my specifications. I was blown away. I didn't know what to do. Within two days, I was able to call my new business number, and hear all the lovely extensions working as promised. Plus received notifications through my email about the phone calls.Overall, I highly recommend UniTel Voice. They are in a class by themselves. They provided me with a no-nonsense approach to products and features, outstanding customer service, and weren't trying to sell me features I wasn't going to use. Thank you, Frank!"

In fact, some of the reviews on this Trustpilot page helped me make up my mind to go with UniTel Voice.I watched the videos and was able to pause the video and follow instructions for set-up - EASY! After set-up I tested and had some additional things I wanted to fix. I was able to find answers in their easy-to-navigate \"Help Desk\" page.Then I still had a few questions so sent some questions to their support email... I was shocked to get a phone call from an actual person who thought it might be faster to help me over the phone - it was!! With my permission, he was  even able to make some small changes with my permission - again - EASY :).I am just starting out with one employee - me - but can see that I will be able to grow with this phone system and am very happy with my decision!!"
