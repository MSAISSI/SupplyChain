There is no way after you finish a call if you want to dial another number. You have to hang up and dial the other number.  Why can't Tawagpinas allow the caller to push # or something like that to be able to dial another number??3. It is not uncommon to place a call that doesn't go through or you get a strange recording including ones that say the person is out of area, and yet Tawagpinas charges the customer for the call.4. finally, the rates to the Philippines are too high.  Tawagpinas knows that most calls are to cellphone which have higher rates than calls to landlines."

I have been using tawagpinas for some years and don't have any bad experience until lately. First, there is limited access #s now, the one I used to use is no longer working (856) so I have to research another access # (732). Then dialing my family in the Philippines is tough getting a connection and when I did, a lot of times the connection disconnects in middle of conversation. Other times I have noticed too is when it rang on the other side but didn't get any connection, the minute was reduced. Hope that this recent experience will help tawagpinas improve their service. I am not sure though if its only because of the holidays, but in any case, they should have anticipated more volume during this season."

That's a real headache.Then when i have enough balance to make a 1 or 2 minute call, TawagPinas will interrupt the call to tell me my balance is low.  This is annoying.  I wish they would stop doing that. After all they tell me at the start of the call what my balance is, so why are they interrupting my call to try to get me to add more money??  Also, I wish they would allow me to add $2 if i choose to do so while on the phone.  Their minimum is $5.Finally, I feel their rates to the Philippines are a bit on the high side."

When the call is 'failed attempt' (this is the term used by customer service), this is when you call and it will say '... voice mail', it would deduct 10 cents automatically. So x numbers of call with that adds up. The thing is, customer service was fast and said they will credit back (and they did) and to let me now if problem persists. It is good that credit is given back, HOWEVER, If they already know that this is a problem, just FIX the system to NOT charge when this happens instead of having the customer message everytime and asking for credit back."
