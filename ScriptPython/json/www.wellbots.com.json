He also promised again to update me on the status of my order by the following day...still have not heard back from him.  I've cancelled my order and still awaiting my refund.  BE VERY CAREFUL.  Also, although their website claims (on item # 3 of their list on why you should shop at Wellbots) that they provide \" Free shipping on everything\" they charge for shipping.  THEY LIE !!!!"

So far, I don't know yet whether I'll be able to get the item before I leave for my vacation."

          "Contenu": "Before finally deciding on buying another power station from Wellbots I recieved a call from an individual at Welbots, asking if I had any questionsHe saw I was shopping for another power station and wanted to know if I had any questions. I explained that I was interested in the Combo deal being offered for the Delta 2 with 160 watt solar panels. I told him that my concern about making another purchase from Wellbots was that my first order (Delta 2 Max with 2 160watt solar panels) did not include any connector cables. My first order was delivered to my home address in Minnesota and required me to order the correct cables on Amazon. He assured me this was a complete combo with everything needed was included and the first order was a mistake. He said he would send an inquiry to Ecoflow and have something sent out to my home in Minnesota to complete my first order. Based on this, I ordered the Delta 2 with with a 160watt solar panel, and once again I didn't get anything to connect the solar panel. This was delivered to my work site in Washington State.I'm frustrated, had I just been told it wasn't included I could have easily ordered the required cables at time of purchase. Fool me once... shame on you!Fool me twice... shame on me! The frustrating part of all this, is I'm being forced to write an email, because when I called and asked to talk to the same individual (withholding his name) regarding my frustration, I was told I have to send an email to get help.So, this is the actual copy of my email to them, I'm just posting on review sites to help others from the same frustration. Very Frustrating!"

I received notifications informing me of the mysteries. Therefore I went online to their website to manage the delivery process and I set it to hold my package where it was and I would just come get it since they continuously fail at delivering. now they're saying that they can't hold the package and they're returning it to the shipper. Seems awfully fishy to me. Seems more like there was never a package to begin with. In conclusion, i would avoid making an order from this company at all costs. I'm so pissed off right now! I'm going to go ahead and start the legal process to get my money back because I'm sick and tired of dealing with this company at this point."

That said, FedEx points the finger back at Wellbots and told me that the label has been created but the ebike hasn't been received/transferred from Wellbots. So I'm currently in limbo. Wellbots has been paid and I'm left to take them on their word that one day I'll have my bike delivered to me."

I spoke to FedEx who alerted me that this should be Wellbots issue to resolve and when I reached back out to Wellbots they have gone radio silent. This is exactly what I knew would happen. I want my product refunded and to regain the trust in this company so I can make future purchases but it is becoming increasingly more difficult with every single passing day with no resolution to my problem.Good customer service requires communication and resolve this has been neither."

I responded angrily that I didn't want it fixed, it was delivered with an issue, I wanted a new one. They never responded to my email, but did eventually send a new one.

The gentleman (I forget his name) that helped me was very helpful, patient, and walked me through all of my questions.  The pricing and free delivery to my doorstep were the best deal I could find anywhere online so I ended up ordering two (2) MotoTec Mud Monster XL go-karts as Christmas presents for my kids. I was told there were only four (4) left in stock but that my order of two (2) would arrive in time for Christmas.  This order took place right before Thanksgiving.About a day or two later I received email confirmation for the order of two (2) Mototec go-karts and a few days after that, I received the shipping information.  Everything seemed to be moving along as I had been told by the sales team.Two weeks or so after that I was contacted by the delivery company and made arrangements to have them delivered to my house (plenty of time before Christmas).  However, when I got home from work that day, I only saw one (1) go-kart delivery and when I checked the bill of lading, it only showed a shipment for one (1) go-kart.  I contacted the delivery company and they confirmed they only received one (1) go-kart from Wellbots. I called Wellbots the next day and spoke to a representative (Alex, who was helpful and courteous) who looked into the discrepancy for me.  The following day, he called me and let me know there was only one (1) available go-kart when I made my purchase and that the next batch of go-karts was not expected by Wellbots until the end of December.  He apologized and asked if I ever received an email from Wellbots indicating I would only be receiving one (1) go-kart after all and I let him know I did not.  Again, he apologized, explained they have been experiencing some \"bugs\" in their system, and offered a small discount ($20.00) for the \"miscommunication.\"  He also offered to refund the difference of one (1) go-kart if I opted not to keep the order in place.Alex later recontacted me and advised the next shipment of go-karts were likely not going to arrive in the Wellbots warehouse until early January.  Despite being treated by helpful and friendly staff whenever I've been in contact with Wellbots, my over all experience has not been great.  I specifically called in the order over the phone to make sure there were no mistakes in the order and ordered them early to make sure they would arrive before Christmas.  Now, both a significant mistake has occurred, resulting in the fact that only one will be here on time for Christmas.  Thus, the jury is still out.  As of this writing I am waiting to hear if Wellbots has some way, other than a $20.00 discount on a $1,500.00 purchase to try to make this right.  I will update this review accordingly once this gets resolved."

I understand the Holidays may affect the shipment, so I waited to contact Wellbots.  On 29 December 2022 , when I did not get a shipping email, I sent an email to the support address in the confirmation email I received.  I did not get a response to the support email.  On 7 January 2023, to my surprise, I received the SuperTank Pro.  On 8 January 2023, I received an email saying my order was on the way - AFTER I received the SuperTank Pro!  The communication from Wellbots was not good.  While I received the SuperTank Pro, it would have been good to know when to expect the package.  Wellbots needs to communicate with its customers better.  I would not have minded a delay if I was informed about it.  Based on this experience, I will probably order from some place else even if Wellbots has the lowest price."

It took them 3 days to return an email in which they said the item was shipped and they couldn't make the change. However, I didn't receive a confirmation email and tracking number; the order still reads \"You\u2019ll receive an email when your order is ready.\"Wellbots's customer service is full of lies. Their live chat window boasts of \"typically reply within minutes.\" My experience is that they typically ignore you and occasionally reply after half a day. Avoid Wellbots. Eventually, the meager discount you get from Wellbots comes at a huge emotional cost.Update: The order was delivered within 1 week, as advertised by the retailer; and they gave me the color that I wanted. It was still not a satisfactory experience because I had never received an email confirming the shipping of my order. To date, my order status still reads \"Your order is confirmed. You\u2019ll receive an email when your order is ready.\" Not only did their system malfunction, but also their customer service. They did not provide me with correct information with regard to my order.I thus changed my rating to 3 stars."

Original: Haven't even received item yet but won't shop here again. Ordered on a Tues..said 2-3 days processing. Thursday I was inquiring status..hadn't shipped. Friday still nothing, and - they didn't answer live chat or email so now i had to wait the weekend. Monday still nothing. Finally called and got a human, which was great (but hard to understand). There was a \"delay\" but they'd get it shipped today (no notification of this delay was provided). I asked if they could expedite shipping she said she couldn't or it would be a big extra charge. I asked if it could be waived since there was a delay on their side..she said she would check and get back to me..and never did. Shortly after it was shipped via snail speed ground and isn't expected until Friday night (another 4 days). I understand it's not Amazon, but if you want to compete with them (all for it) you are going to have to find a way to do a little better than 10 days when people are used to next day arrival (if it arrives on time)."

I unfolded it easily. And off we went...It was very easy to operate.  I have to say it was too fast for me on level 1 full. I had to put it back to as low as it could go.  I would suggest a slower speed or 2 than what it has now. The basket and bag are both very handy.  Not to crazy about having to fold up the basket before we can fold up the trike. I will be recommending this trike to everyone.  Family and friends!Please improve the user manual. Thanks!!"

The worst must be their customer service. They said many things during the support but did many things different. One example, the customer support, Bryan said he would let me return the \"late arrival\" bike FREE but next day, he asked me to pay a high shipping fee to return it. 2. The next thing I don't like is that they are not reliable and didn't give me a good trust. They promised to deliver it on a given day I planned for my trip, but more than 2 weeks later the item arrived. The item arrived late and I had the bike unused. They blamed on their logistic for delaying it. Well, I buy an item from you, you promised to deliver it on a given day. If you couldn't do that, do not put the promised date on the order. Also a delay from your logistic is a delay done by you because they partnered with you for this business. 3. When I kept seeing the routing of my order kept changing on the tracking number, I contacted their customer service. Instead of them contact the logistic, they asked me to go around, make phone calls to track it. This is not right. 4. Another example of their bad customer service. Brian said he talked to his manager and got approved for a free return and would come back with a return label. Well he never returned with such label. I read a few bad reviews about wellbots, but I didn't trust those reviews. That was bad on my part, but then wellbots proved me how right other customers were. Never again. People please be aware of wellbots and their business."

We tried regular Bark Collars, but unless you have it cinched up to just before choking, he never felt it.With this collar, we have only needed to use the vibrate, and a verbal command, which brings him up short.  Wish we didn't have to charge the collar every third day, the remote holds the charge for a month.  Of course we have a long way to go, but at least he isn't annoying our neighbors, and my husband  :)Thank you Again,Terry-Ann Pesselt"

I first tried by phone, but was never able to get through, so I requested cancellation via the contact form on their website. I did not receive a response until Wednesday, at which point they told me it could not be cancelled because it had already shipped. Then on Thursday I received a notification email saying that my order had just been shipped. When I asked for them to cover return shipping costs since I had asked for the order to be cancelled before it was actually shipped, they declined and informed me that I would need to pay $30 if I chose to return my order."

Thank you Elliot. Merci mille foisI ordered a product, refurbished dji osmo+, the site was quick and easy to use. Took my money right away. Paid extra for shipping as I am super excited to get this product. After I checked on the status of my product, it stated \"Awaiting Shipment\" - when I spoke to a customer service agent, Peter, he said the item was actually not in stock. This is a confusing practice as my money was taken for what seems to be an invisible product that did not state it was backordered or will be back ordered. For future reference it would serve better to just have it state that to begin with.Peter's customer service SUCKS. \"Peter15:17I don't understand. What do you want me to do?\"And I asked 4 times about cancelling my order. Im pretty sure all these positive reviews are paid for.  Peter still has not seen my messages after I have asked multiple times to receive a refund. Thanks peter..."

I read manga and fanfic on it, it\u2019s so much more versatile than a kindle and the side buttons are my fave! very lightweight.

And Wellbots definitely has competitive prices; I don\u2019t want to give the wrong impression about that.)After a few positive purchase experiences with Wellbots, including several truly exceptional customer service experiences, I want to give back on behalf of other folks wondering if they can trust Wellbots. The answer is a resounding yes!! They are the real deal. And they go the extra mile to support their customers.Seriously \u2014 if you\u2019re choosing between Wellbots and some other place to make a purchase, choose Wellbots. There aren\u2019t that many competitors that match their customer service, let alone at the competitive prices they offer."

Any minor questions I had after the sales were addressed by email within 12 hours. Customer service is top notch  I shall be adding to another solar system I already have.

I came well packaged, and early then estimated. I couldn't wait to get started and used it that evening. My little pup was initially startled by the noise but quickly got used to it. It cut her hair quickly and efficiently. If you're on the fence about this product, buy it!"

They answered all of our questions that we had except one. He told us to send an email and we would get a response in 30 or so. About 20 minutes later, a tech person responded to the email with the answers. And we hadn't even ordered yet! Once we placed the order, it was shipped and delivered as promised. The packaging was secure and sturdy. We have been using our Delta 2 and extra battery for a couple of weeks now and it has lived up to all expectations. Very pleased with this company and product all the way around."

Many may have the ability to sell you a product but few stand behind the products they offer and their customer."
