          "Contenu": "Update: Within 30 minutes of writing my original review, I received a call from the company letting me know that I should receive my refund shortly. I never asked for a refund but it hit my bank account this morning, less than 24-hours from the time they sent it! I asked if they wanted me to return the defective product, was told no need to return it. I am TRULY IMPRESSED with the level of customer service and  effort to make my customer experience better. I will buy from Encore Data in the future. Hopefully this was a one off. Everyone deserves a second chance, especially when they do right by you!I received the headsets with mic within the time that was promised but after only a few days, they stopped working. People can not hear me when I speak into the mic. VERY DISSATISFIED with this product. I knew because of the price point that they were bottom of the line in quality. However, I did expect more than a week out them!"

Overall pretty satisfied initially and hope that once I really start using them they'll do the job for me."

I had ordered the antimicrobial wipes which most places have been out of and they made sure I could get them for our business. So glad I ordered these. Good sized sheets and you can wipes down a pretty big area before it starts to dry out on you. The smell is pleasant as well. Not hard like chemicals but no so lemony that you instantly pucker. Very happy with this product, especially during these strange times. Will definitely order again. Thank You."

There were a couple that were a bit smashed on the corner, but still usable.  There was one that the rings did not close properly and I had to return it for a new one.  Customer service took a little time to figure out how to exchange the item (I think the issue was that it was a single binder and not a whole case), but did so without fuss.  Although these are decent binders, they are not holding up as well as I had hoped they would - probably because they are being dragged around by 7-9 year olds!  Overall, I am happy enough since they were a great price.  However, I may have to find something new next year - or spend a little more for a higher grade binder.  Thanks!"

I like that there is volume control, the headphones fit a variety of head shapes and sizes from kindergarten to sixth grade, they are durable, the sound quality is great for the computer lab, and the cord is fabric-y so that it deters children from chewing on the cord. I recommend these headphones for a classroom!"
