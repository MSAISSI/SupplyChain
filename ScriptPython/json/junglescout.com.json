          "Contenu": "***Avoid this company***Estimates are wildly inaccurate.The estimates are incredibly inaccurate. I paid for a year of service but soon realised that the estimations were way off. I could have accepted up to a 20% difference, but most of them were showing over 5 times the actual sales at the very least. The worst case was more than 100 times off.When I contacted customer service about the issue, they simply blamed Amazon, saying they were only displaying the sub-category data. It would have been much better if the software showed no data at all, rather than providing such wildly inaccurate figures.They have now updated me 4 months later saying they have \"fixed\" the issue. This company has cost me thousands with their issues and then had the cheek to offer me 2 months free as \"compensation\"."

I asked them to add one extra day of active subscription as I did not have an opportunity to use JungleScout features due to their bug. Double ping message did not help.So, you need to understand that you as their pottential and actual customer can be ignored by support. Also, there is a chance that you will be charged for the service and will not have an opportunity to use them!"

Many products they show are not what they seem to be, info is often inaccurate and many times the chrome extension doesn't work well. I've paid a couple hundred bucks and I'm very disappointed. I started using other software to compare and many worked better or gave me really interesting products that JS didn't show. Eventhough I have the pro chrome extension I use other extensions now. waste of my money."

The only data available was incredibly vague and no better than using Amazon directly / Sonar. JS has no real suggestion other than to wait for them to catch up. So unfortunately i cannot comment on the rest of the functions, very disappointing but my suggestion is to use the 14 days trial thoroughly to check that all tools you need work as they should for your specific marketplace and category also checking their accuracy. Cancelling within the 14 days was very quick and easy however and i received a fast full refund. You will need to check terms of cancellation if you have this issue beyond the trial period."

As a customer, I'm saying this could have been made much clearer to first time purchasers. Once I discovered this, I contacted you and was informed I needed to purchase the Suite Plan to obtain sufficient Product Research inquiries.  At the time, I saw it advertised for $49/mo. and requested an upgrade.  I was then informed that the price increased to $69/mo.  This looked like deceptive/false/bait&switch advertising  and I canceled everything.  This was very disturbing to me and I thought how can they treat customers like that?

Jungle Scout is a mess after they merged JumpSend, JungleScout, and others.I can't use the Launch to promote my new product ever since they merged,  there is some technical issue on their end that makes the information can't be synchronized from Amazon. Without a correct profile image, it's useless to do a giveaway on Launch (formerly, jump send). I've been asking them to fix it and they admitted there's a bug but they still haven't been able to fix such a small bug for over a month. Their e-mail templates have also been broken with regards to simple \"variable\" replacements. Something so simple, yet it's been months and they can't fix it. All I've gotten from them is daily automated e-mails saying \"Thank you for raising the issue, your issue is being investigated as VIP and we'll get back to you...\"You might want to wait till they get more stable support if you plan to subscribe to it."

The problem I have is that the fees are not accurately calculated.  After several weeks and countless hours of research and product development I placed my first order based on info from the product database. It appeared from JS that I could net about $6-8 per unit after sourcing and shipping to Amazon.  The problem is that JS mis calculated fees by $6 thus leaving me with a product that will make no money. I have checked dozens of other products against the FBA fee calculator and they are way off. Mostly by 15%. Some over 20%. The mistake I made was finding the amazon fee calculator after my order was placed. I trusted JS\u2019s info. They have skirted the problem in several emails and never addressed it head on.  It\u2019s a problem and the info is highly misleading. To this day, it\u2019s still a problem."

After being forced to choose a new plan, I was charged additional fees on my account, on top of what they already charged me for my annual subscription and the mysterious upgrade charge, with no clear explanation as to how any new charges were calculated. After a week of back and forth on email with no option to speak to someone else or escalate my concerns, I was forced to cancel my subscription due to this, which was not my intention. If it were not for this customer service experience, I would've remained a paying Jungle Scout customer. Although received I some partial refunds, only after having to ask repeatedly for them, I had to accept some charges - however there was no transparency in this whole process, none of the refunded or un-refunded amounts were clearly explained to me. And now my chrome extension is inactive - although i purchased this product as a one time charge back in 2018.  It was not part of a subscription.I'm leaving this review for current users, this will be the expectation in your near future."

I went back into my JS account and their was no record of my cancellation date. I contacted their customer service, they got back to me with a lame excuse. Word to the wise - take a screenshot of your cancellation page and make them honor their guarantee.**UPDATE: Jungle Scout responded to my review shortly after my submission. They get an extra star for that. Jungle Scout also refunded me the amount that I paid. It was described as an exception, however it ought to be standard. I thanked the representative and added that it was ironic that a data company doesn\u2019t provide account data(i.e. dates) to their customers. Once my budget allows, I would use them again. For that, another star."

I know that JS cannot provide its customers with accurate numbers, but would be nice if it was closer to the real deal!

I've contacted support twice and they advise that the limit is currently 5,000.  Fine but why can't I just move to the next 5,000?   I find it very frustrating. Additionally, I can only download 200 lines of the CSV file.  I hope you can find a way to allow much greater access.Jo"

Jungle Scout is the first software of the market, that is why many people choose them but it is not good enough for me. Their strongest card is supplier database, I respect that, but finding and tracking supplier is the only advantage of Jungle Scout against competitors. To sum up, as a 350k/year professional fba seller, I have used paid plans for almost everything. My favorite is Helium 10.Let me explain short and easy,Jungle Scout = NokiaHelium 10 = Apple Iphone"

I initially had an issue with the extension and went back and forth trying to get it fixed, the end result...we will let our tech know about the problem. No fix for me it was like oh well deal with the issue. Next came my cancelling of my App and working with the extension. An error in billing and instead of taking the time to be thorough my extension, which I was still active was cancelled. I immediately reached out as I was due to participate in a webinar using the extension. No response. I again reached out hearing back a couple days or near that missing my webinar. In the message the customer service rep used an exclamation, like I don't know what that means and stated, oh I extended your account 2 days, you didn't extend anything that's what I paid for.  Not good, actually bad. I don't know anyone at Helium but they sure have treated me better. Greg, you're webinar's are helpful, videos good, but take a look at customer service. I may be but one customer but I'm sure this isn't just me.  I should have been treated a lot better. I trusted your service, spent my money...sad."

I think the type of error I am writing below should not be part of JS. Their extension is cool but I no longer use their web app, I am using another company which seems better.If JS improves their service to catchup with other companies in terms of reliability, more tools and punctual customer service I think I can re-consider to try them again. (but it seems it's a better tool for beginners)----I appreciate some of the JS tools and I have used it (keyword research, listing builder, asking for reviews tool etc.) and I had good experience with customer service. I appreciated because in the beginning it helped me a lot.But recently, there is a major bug on the website about the calendars, I have tried many times from chrome and safari. I cannot use the promotions tool and also cannot review my profits. It is still going on. I have sent 3 emails and NONE of them got response.Today I cannot even log in to my account, it just shows a blank page. That was the last drop on the glass. How I can rely on JS if it gives me problems like that? If you guys could communicate me in advance or respond timely I could understand, but it seems nobody cares.I am very very disappointed about this."

Now, you guys came out with a much more streamlined e-book and 7 part product research videos. You guys denied me and every members who already paid for JS with some absurd rational that you set (anyone who joined 2 weeks prior to the 2017 special is not getting these 2 valuable resources. Try to tell that to customers who joined 18 - 20 days before and see how that's turn out). Your customers who already paid for JS could benefit from the e-book and the video lessons for sure. By pointing out to similar resources that used to create these ebooks and videos bonuses as an alternative solution is alright but not good enough since it will take more time to go through those scattered videos (which defeat the purpose of time saving by using JS).By telling me that you're considered to make these two resources available to current members in the future is not good enough either. Those two resources are already available for new members which mean it wouldn't cost you much to actually provide great value for your current members.Since, JS doesn't value a paying customer like myself, I will not continue with the monthly payment. (I get it, I already paid for the extension so no more significant value financially. There is no big $ to be made from me just a low value monthly payment which I could cancel anytime).Please don't contact me again."

          "Contenu": "A great help and useful tool, though for the price I feel it could provide a better user experience.Pros: Saves you a crap ton of time.  It aggregates all the data that you want (or most of it anyway) from an Amazon search page in just a few minutes versus the 15 or so minutes it would take you to do the same.Easy to use.  Very easy.Cons:While it is far faster than doing the work yourself, it really could be faster.  Opening the extension on a search page still takes it a few minutes to grab all the data and then usually another minute for the \"opportunity\" score to appear.  Not deceptive, but they make it appear to function far faster in their videosLogging in all the time.  I get they don't want people sharing the app, bu the fact is almost everyone uses multiple computers and browsers these days.  Most have a PC and a laptop or example.  Every time I move from one to the other, I have to relog in.  Further more, if I want several browser windows open for organization, it often makes me log out in one to log in on another.Not as configureable as I'd like.  For example, you can't set how many results to list.  In nearly every class given on product research, including Jungle Scout's own videos, it is suggested to look at the top 10 for certain metrics.  This extension handily gives you information like average sales volume, average cost, average rating, etc but you can't see the averages for the Top 10 because it always retrieves 60 some odd results.  I'd love to see an option to limit the results to just the first 10-15 items (or really user settable) to make it both run faster and make the averages more useful.Laggy UI.  The UI is not smooth and sometimes frustrating.  When you are trying for example to remove items, the \"X\" often doesn't even show up, you have to wav your mouse around to get it to come up.  Adding items with the \"+\" icon sometimes just does nothing, or takes several seconds.No bulk actions.  It would be nice to be able to have a column for selecting multiple items and then have bulk operations on the selected items like add all selected to tracker, or export data just for selected items.Overall a very nice and useful extension, but with lots of room for improvement especially given the cost.  If it was half the price I would be more forgiving of its shortcomings."

          "Contenu": "When we \"subscribed\" to a monthly plan to test out the software, their prompts told us it was $49/month for the plan we wanted. We figured that was an OK price to test out the software for a few months to see if it was something we could make use of. So, we subscribed and didn't think about the pricing again (rarely using the software) until 4 months later when reviewing our credit card statement I see that we had that same day been shifted into a \"Seller Level 5\" tier and charged an additional $350! Then, we were charged $400 per month for the next 3 months. Our accountant thought I had legitimately decided to pay $400 for the software so never raised the issue to me. Apparently, after subscribing, JungleScout prompted us to sync our orders in order to utilize all the \"features\" of their software. We didn't really need these additional features, but figured we'd test them out since we were paying for the software anyhow. Of course, those prompts didn't warn us that if our orders were above certain thresholds, we would be charged WAY more than we'd signed up for.  After JungleScout imported our sales stats they upped our fee without the slightest warning or notification either on our account after signing in nor via email. To top it off, JungleScout never sent 1 email with an invoice. To me, this implies that they are making every effort to hide their charges from sellers in order to swindle sellers into overpaying. Have you ever had an online subscription that didn't email you every time they charged you, nonetheless when they shift you into a new pricing tier that costs 4x more?? Of course, had I received any sort of notification I would have immediately canceled, but they probably know that and that's why they don't bother notifying customers.My guess is that this deception is part of their tactics, in hopes that as sellers grow they can skim more from their customers and hope it gets through unnoticed, siphoning away your hard earned money.  Even if you are a small seller, I would be wary to start developing your business practices around software built on such questionable tactics. If you decide to give it a try, just be aware of the pricing scheme. My suggestion would be to look elsewhere, as there are other options out there with similar tools that are transparent with their pricing. To JungleScout's credit, they did end up refunding the extra that was charged for those 4 months without too much of a hassle, but I doubt they will change their method of charging/notifying customers.The software may be OK, but it's clearly backed by a company with questionable tactics that I would not be comfortable basing my business around. We tested another option at the same time and preferred their data and interface over that of Jungle Scout, at least for what we wanted out of the software.TLDR - Beware of their pricing scheme that is not immediately apparent and that charges/increases automatically. You will receive no notification of charges or increases. There are other options, take the time to test out what's out there."

I had to open up another dispute with my card company and my card Company  said their hands are tied and they can't take the funds back from them for a second time. They gave me a fake ARN to \"track down the funds.\" My card company told me that it is a fake ARN number and that there are no funds to track. Truly disappointed with the company and I advise anyone to steer clear."

I would expect that this is supposed to be a cutting edge company that would have a chat option, so they can respond to customer queries in real time. So the only option is to send an email and wait ( perhaps for days) to get a response to a query raised.  I've not even started using the product yet because I'm unable to download the extension. Off the gate customer service is rated one star! I mean not a company like this .. no chat option!Okay i was impressed about how Jungle scout redeemed this situation. Im glad that brands are catching on to the fact that its all about perception. Thanks Jungle scout!"
