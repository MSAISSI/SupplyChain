          "Contenu": "DreamHost wasn\u2019t so Dreamy! I was with DreamHost for several years always having issues with the uptime of my sites. While I had an entry level Virtual Private Server (VPS) with DreamHost, I had never had an issue like this with my previous VPS providers. Trouble tickets were created with DreamHost Support over the years and I would always follow any advice to optimize the speed of the processor and/or RAM usage, however nothing seemed to change the performance of my sites on their VPS. Also, just because you purchased a VPS with DreamHost does not mean that your SQL databases will run on it. I\u2019m pretty sure they are still using shared hosting for your SQL databases and they upsell you to move them over to a faster VPS.In addition to the uptime issues, they kept raising their rates on a VPS that was not working properly and auto renewing my contract. If you don\u2019t cancel your auto renewing VPS subscription in time, they will charge you for everyday that it is open or running, so be sure to backup your sites and cancel or close your VPS before the plan auto renews.If you are looking for a VPS I would do your research because hosting companies have a huge markup on their products. I would recommend looking at a VPS like AWS Lightsail. It may take a little more work and education on the platform to get started however in the long run you will understand how a VPS works with a lower overall expense.  I hope this helps someone that has had the same experience that I have had with DreamHost."

Getting backups of the files proved unfruitful, and restoring these files were of little use without having a SUDO account.

We checked within minutes, and all files are properly linked and are active, being accessed regularly by viewers. I wrote back and told Dreamhost this. Then we wrote again providing even more information. we waited for a reply. We have now received two more replies same as the first one, all identical, saying we were in AUP violation by hosting these files. We wrote two more times. Dreamhost will not respond in any way except to continue repeating the same AUP violation email. Obviously, this is nuts, and we are left to conclude that DreamHost has been taken over by crazy woke millennials. Since Dreamhost steadfastly refuses to respond in any logical manner, we are now going to the following agencies with our complaints, including but not limited to, TrutPilot, the attorney general, the FTC, and many others. If they forcibly remove valid, linked content, saying they are orphaned, we will turn it over to the attorneys and tell them to get in into court no matter what it takes. Clearly, there is something wrong with Dreamhost's people. Clearly. In 20 years with Dreamhost, they have become flakier and flakier. Now they appear to be not only utterly worthless, but a true financial liability as well."

The first version of the 'repaired' site was so obviously broken that I had to ask that it be taken offline; when I pointed out the obvious issues I was then told that I would have to pay several hundred dollars extra for the site to be brought back as it was before it was hacked - which is what they told me I would get for the first payment.On top of that, they was never any sense of urgency and they failed to keep my colleagues copied in on correspondence properly despite being repeatedly asked to copy everyone in.I will be migrating the site away from the provider so that I won't ever be in a position where I have to rely upon them again."

          "Contenu": "My blog theme had been customized for over 10 years, and it was working fine. However, a few days ago, I encountered an issue where the dreamhost informed me that one of the folders had reached its storage limit, which prevented me from publishing new posts. They deleted the old backup and restored the data, but unfortunately, the work I had done in the past few days was lost. Although the homepage appeared perfect and intact, when I clicked on a post link, it displayed a blank page and indicated that the theme directory did not exist.I contacted the support team and provided specific links, but each time I received a response from a new person who didn't read the chat history. They either seemed too busy to address the problems I mentioned or provided incorrect replies intended for other customers. In the meantime, I discovered that my theme had been switched to another theme by DreamHost (possibly for testing purposes). I immediately switched back to my original theme, only to realize that I could no longer customize it. The theme was too old, the developer was no longer available, and it wasn't compatible with the current WordPress system. In summary, I now need to choose and purchase a new theme and seek customization. Currently, my blog looks very unattractive, and it seems like I might have to abandon all the work I have done for this blog over the past 16 years.The main point is that it would be more effective for both parties if the same person could follow a case, so I wouldn't have to explain everything from the beginning again. This would also help resolve the issues more efficiently. I feel extremely frustrated right now."

After checking my account I saw a bill of 34,99 dollars which appeared from nowhere. It Has been 25 days since I wrote to them being assured all will be fixed and I am trying to negotiate that it has been a mistake but they are very poor in explanations and they don't understand what I am writing about nor what they said 25 days ago. I wonder if they really understand English as they said they will close my account if I don't pay their absurd bill until the 14th of August for nothing and this sucks anyway. I don't want to pay for something I didn't agree on. Can someone really help me make some justice here as no one deserves to lose their work, time and money?I will also make a video review this week on my YouTube Channel so people like me with a low starting budget for a website and business don't waste the little money they have on this service that is lacking humanity and quality customer support and fair play.There is a word in my country, I hope you buy yourself candles for all the money you are taking illegally from people...The End"

Outcome is domain is now renewed (thanks to my perseverance) but it remains one star for inconvenience, lack of explanation as to why it failed,  and lack of customer care.----------I decided to renew one of my domains and paid in full. I received a receipt confirming payment, but nowhere on the receipt did it indicate what it was for. Logging into DreamHost's panel wasn't any more helpful. Just indicated a payment but no explanation, so the receipt is worse than useless. HMRC will question this, and unless detail is written on it, I won't be able to provide answers, so they'd probably disallow it.So the issue is despite paying the renewal fee, the domain remains set to expire in a few days!!!!!Absolute pile of crap to be honest. Typical 'take your money' and don't actually do what you paid them. I clicked Renew against this domain so there's no possibility of mistake on my part.I spoke with an agent via web chat who couldn't see any evidence of the renewal and couldn't explain what was going on. He had to 'email' the 'team' hoping for a response. Really?! I mean the incompetence is spreading. They shouldn't be allowed to take money if it's not allocated to a service. Stealing money from \u2260customers is probably not your best policy!Dreamhost: sort this out and explain why this has happened. The way things are, I am not now planning to renew hosting and may take all my domains and hosting elsewhere and claim a full refund of ALL payments. And that will be a minimum. I may seek legal retribution for this inexcusable incompetence. Really incensed by your incompetence."

They were simply the best. No problems, and support was as swift as it was smart. In short, Dreamhost was a dream!But that dream turned into a nightmare this year, when my busiest and most crucial domain was hijacked. And in my hour of need, Dreamhost support failed me completely. Nobody could explain the problem to me or how long it would or could take to fix. I asked for help from a supervisor on multiple occasions, and was told nobody knew when their supervisor was coming back to work next.Worst of all, with all their support now coming from overseas, the first hour or so of every interaction involved me trying over and over again to explain the problem to someone who just couldn't understand me (and who I couldn't understand in return). By the time support did finally understand what as going on, I was in tears and ready to give up - only to discover that it would take another 1-4 hours for them to tell me they didn't know.In total, I spent roughly 14 hours over 4 days trying to restore my domain and email and associated services. All the while dealing with an uncaring, unresponsive, and lethargic support team who would rather fob me off  to the incoming day/night shift than alay my concerns.I'm in the process of transferring all 20+ domains and websites out of Dreamhost now. Customer support is critical when it comes to web hosting and Dreamhost just doesn't care about their customers anymore."

          "Contenu": "SEE OVER 200 1 Star Reviews on TrustPilot!! - I have hosted with Dream Host for over a decade. At first, they were amazing with support and service; speedy load times, etc.However; when I signed up all those years ago, I was given a \"discounted\" rate of $5/month with unlimited everything, including unlimited hosted domains.They said it was not a discount gimmick, but would stay that price until I decided to discontinue my hosting plan.Over the past few years, not only have my servers been bogged down to where my Web sites were taking a considerably embarrassing amount of time to load (in front of clients, many times) - but they obviously hired a bunch of challenged individuals for tech support that don't have a clue how to talk to customers, provide prompt service or make things happen like they used to do.I have literally had techs just go in the back of my system for me many times and fix issues that they could see, without requiring me to do it.This was amazing customer support (THEN, not now), where they saw an issue on their end and fixed it.Recently, these lazy techs they have working for them now have found issues, after making me wait for a unnecessary amount of time - but instead of just clicking a button to fix it - send me in circles to figure out how to get to the same page they were on, expecting me to fix it, myself.Not only have these unprofessional NEW techs made getting help a huge nightmare, but they have redesigned their pages and navigation of the admin sections so confusing, you can't find anything that would sensibly be found in an ordinarily expected menu heading, sub menu or button.But my biggest problem was when I found out I was being billed $15/month for my $5/month hosting plan, without any prior notice - and against the agreement I initially signed up for over a decade ago - where I was told it would stay at the $5/month fee until I discontinued my plan.When confronting them about this, they made excuses, but wouldn't show me any agreement that stated they could change my plan to another rate, or where I had agreed to such changes.Instead of putting me back on my same payment plan, they said \"We feel like we are offering our customers a great value as we keep upgrading things to make our services better.\"That's bull-crap corporate (greedy) lingo for \"We know you were fine with what you were getting, but to justify our desire to buy more stuff and increase our CE0's take home check, etc - we are going to force a full $10 extra per month on you, without prior notice, without proof of an agreement when you signed up (that says we can and you agree to let us)\".Even a few years ago I was blown away to see them try a sneaky approach to get new sign ups by stating \"$4/month hosting, unlimited everything\".But after being funneled through a cleverly crafted slew of pages and drivel about their amazing features, you end up finding out that $4/month fee is only available if you pay for THREE full years at sign up!I am tired of their excuses and nonsense. I refuse to pay anyone more if I didn't agree to such increases and they cannot provide me any proof that their agreement with me gave them the right to do so in the future.Today, I tried to change the DNS of my domains on Dreamhost (NightmareHost) to another hosting company.They literally blocked my access to do so; in other words, holding my domains that I already paid fees to use, hostage, wanting me to pay them the extra monthly fees that they FORCED on me without ANY NOTICE.The online tech even told me \"It shouldn't be blocked, you should have access to change the DNS\".Funny how after I asked him about this hostage situation, the BUTTON in my admin page all-of-a-sudden became clickable to get to the DNS page.I asked if he did that, he admitted he did turn it on and then told me I could change the DNS, as I had a right to do so.But when I clicked \"change DNS\" when putting in the new hosting DNS info, it blocked me with \"You don't have permission to do that!\"I asked him why??? He had me wait while he \"looked into it\", then came back to the chat window and said \"unfortunately, access to your DNS is part of our hosting plan\".REALLY??????!!!! They make money from my domain registration fees, but can block me from pointing them to another host because I don't agree to pay their incredibly high jacked up price on my hosting plan?The emails I have used for bank accounts, etc are under the domain they are holding hostage.I smell a big rat with all of the 4+ ratings on this Trust Pilot Web site, as I know other people are tired of this company's downhill fall in quality, outsourcing their tech support to other countries, etc.I don't trust these reviews being real customers, but insiders trying to hide the truth.I CANNOT recommend this hosting company! GREEDY hostage holding thugs that don't care about anything but the CASH!"

It turned out it was some no longer linked content which I forgot about over the years. This seemed fine to me.More recently though, the wiping-out process started becoming much more aggressive and content that was publicly shared started getting removed on the premise of \"misusing the system for backup purposes\". The final straw came when they removed all pictures from my family photo album, which I was building and cataloguing over the years using Lychee. I have no clue how they classified it like that. I reached out to support and essentially got informed that it's not allowed to host a (password-protected) web photo gallery anymore on DreamHost... My yearly renewal was in two days.

I pre-paid for a year, so after that ends, I will be looking for a better shared hosting provider or possibly returning to FatCow. If you only have a simple Wordpress blog and you're not using any plug-ins and have a low visitor count, then the shared hosting might work fine for you.

This was out of the blue, and for no apparent reason.  After some frustrating back and forth discussions, it led to an impass.  I later got an apology from somebody else in the support staff, but by then I had already requested a cancellation and had started service with another provider and had started to move DNS and everything else to the new provider.   Over the years, I had sometimes been told that I'm using too much disk space, or my website is generating too many errors.  Every time, I would work to fix it, and the support staff worked with me while I tried to figure out exactly what they needed me to do.  It wasn't confrontational, until this last one where it sounded like Dreamhost basically decided they didn't want my service.  It was a lot of work and a frustrating situation.  I gave 2 stars because it is probably unfair to give 1 star given years of great service, but the complete and utter lack of quality control on draconian nazi-like support staff is ridiculous."

          "Contenu": "This website took six months to build - whereas I was led to believe (by the sales team) that it would take a month. It is not a commercial site or one that sells products. The average length of time it took for each minor change was 3-5 days or so - and there were many. Sometimes the version that I was asked to review included changes I did not ask for - which resulted in more changes. I think it would have helped immensely if we had been able to discuss the pages being built through a screen share session instead of  me being asked to review each page as it was finished and provide feedback. The feedback I gave seemed to be either misunderstood or ignored.  This resulted in me sending back sometimes several written pages with screen shots to try to explain what needed to change. Often the next version I got back to review - only addressed some of the feedback I gave but not all of it. As you can imagine this was very time consuming and frustrating. There did not seem to be any project quality control - as I was sent pages to review that had - for example - a banner photo with a splice line very visible running through the middle of it. Also the team's selection of elements like social media icons were all over the board - no consistency in size or style. I didn't think these types of things should have to be pointed out by the customer during the feedback stage, and each one of these items - seemed to take an additional 3-5 days to be addressed. The project lead was a very nice person -  but I'm not sure what his role was on the build project - other than liaison with customer - so not sure if he had any say or influence with the actual web team/ coders. I have never given anyone a two star rating before - but I am doing so in this case because the description of services on your website fell quite short of my actual experience."

I have been with DreamHost since 2004 and stayed with them for their customer service, but the quality has completely deteriorated to the point I'm moving everything to another provider.I realize as a shared hosting customer, I'm probably not very high priority--but it doesn't really feel good when I wanted to use Dreamhost for my ecommerce business and don't feel I would get the quality of service I need at scale. A customer should not have to complain on Twitter to get escalated to a support lead. I had a couple of very minor issues that took over 2 weeks to fix because the agents never actually read the emails I sent, just responded with a template that had a vaguely similar keyword. The last straw was when after waiting for days for a fix, I asked GSuite for help. They actually went through proper triage steps and fixed the issue in 5 minutes.When I gave the rep feedback about this, he and said he had never seen the records that needed fixing when I had referenced it in my first email which meant the tickets are definitely not getting the attention they need. If you have a relatively easy problem that can be fixed through reading the Customer Help wiki, then their Customer Service is fine. If you have any issue that needs a human look into your case, enjoy waiting for 1-2 days for a response that's essentially the same thing you just read online until you get so frustrated you end up screaming on the internet. If you're a business owner, you have better things to do than hold a customer service rep's hand while you triage the problem for them. After 16 years, I will be taking my business elsewhere. I checked my customer support records and the last time I asked for help was 6 years ago. I'm not a whiner, just disappointed."

I couldn't understand the connection between hosting and email, and was overpaying for email service monthly for many years.  The customer service support team corresponded with me, a now very angry customer over the day.  I've been billed for hosting fees when all I wanted was email.  The customer service team lectured me instead of helping.  I've been with Dreamhost for more than ten years.  I was prepared to continue email service for the next year but they saw fit to bill me for hosting fees. I'm very let down by the bad faith and legalistic customer service style.  In particular, I am disappointed by Jonathon, Gus and Truman in billing who took the time to say things like:  \"When I reviewed your account's support history, I confirmed that you did not contact us about ending your shared hosting service until earlier today\"  That was from Truman.Translation:  I tried my damndest to resolve my billing problem on my own and not bother anybody about it, but couldn't understand how hosting and email works.  So I'm supposed to contact customer service every time I have a problem, or else I won't get any kind of refund?  I have received much fairer customer service from many other companies I've worked with for just as long as Dreamhost.Truman condescends further:\"I prorated your shared hosting charge posted on  for the time hosting services were rendered to you as a courtesy\"  Well gee, thank you so much, Truman. but if you were really trying to help, you'd recognise that I've been overcharged for years for hosting fees that weren't necessary and not what I wanted.  Again:  \"You need to manually go through the process of canceling the service from your panel, which was not done correctly.\"  That was GusP.\"The active Shared Hosting plan was indeed hosting your active Mailboxesduring that time,  and Indeed hosting service is required for your Email hosting. Had you properly canceled the service at that timeyour email service would have ended as well. However since the service was not canceled your Email service was still active and your mail continued to function during that time.\"Well Gus, isn't it obvious that I tried to do it, but I'm obviously not techy.  But at least I'm an honest, long-term customer.  So what, now I just get charged even more for service I didn't want and didn't need.  Because I \"didn't manually do things correctly\".I've been writing to Dreamhost for hours today.  I've been helped by many other companies I've had to stop working with because money is tight, but Dreamhost has been the most difficult and unhelpful by far."

          "Contenu": "I wanted to start off by saying that if you're looking for inexpensive shared hosting, this is probably a decent choice. Just hope you don't have to place any requests or speak to their 'team' at any point in time. \r I really hate to leave a negative review, but I feel my experience was fairly unacceptable and thought people should know. It all started when I was curious about signing up for an additional package on top of my shared hosting package for a project I was working on. I had signed up for their shared hosting plan before they offered them on SSD's, but now all new customers are apparently offered this and they specifically offer an option in your \"Manage Account\" section to request migration to SSD hosting so I thought I'd give this a shot and see if there was any performance difference before signing up a second package. I did this towards the end of May. Once you process this automated request they send you an automated response and tell you that you're on the waiting list and ask that you remove an unused files etc to quicken the process. Not a problem.\r A week and a half go by and I haven't heard anything about the process so I thought I'd jump into their live chat to ask about how long it will take. I spoke to a rep who states \"It appears there wasn't an explicit request to get moved to the new ssd hosting\", even though its an automated system through their own control panel that even sends a confirmation that you can plainly see in my support history. I explain this to him and he's nice and says \"Ok currently the admin that is doing the migrations is not working so I can't get a definite answer for you right now. But, I will submit a ticket for you and escalate so I can get an answer for you\". Fair enough, thanks.\r A little less than a week go by, no response. I go back into chat and ask for an update and am told \"Okay, it looks like there was some miscommunication before, sorry. You can submit a new ticket about this here to specifically request being upgraded to SSD hosting\" ????? ok, now I'm a bit frustrated. I explain that I've already sent in a request, and spoke to someone who was suppose to escalate my ticket. He then responds \"Okay, I've submitted an expedite request for this for you now. We'll get you upgraded as soon as we possibly can\". Great, thank you for your help.\r The next day I get a response from their \"SSD Migration Team\" saying thanks for being patient, they've logged my request and that they may not be able to have it migrated for \"a week or two\". Keep in mind this is on 6.12.2015 after a few contacts already.\r Two and a half weeks go by, and I thought I'd just check up on the status, they essentially tell me there has been no update on the progress and that I'll be alerted when it's been taken care of. At this point I've decided to go with another provider for my additional services, but decide to keep my shared hosting account and request for SSD migration. Their rep says he understands, and that they will let me know again when this will take place.\r Almost 3 weeks since then and still no update. This is probably the worst experience I've ever had with a hosting company. Two months for a small migration request on an account that doesn't use much space to begin with, and a bunch of contacts with absolutely no resolution. I kept the rating at 3 stars because I feel like I really shouldn't expect much from my shared hosting account. Overall I'm very dissatisfied, and unfortunately they lost potential revenue from the additional VPS accounts/other hosting solutions I was planning to open with them that I've went elsewhere for. Hoping to get some resolution at some point for this though. But I won't hold my breath at this point.\r Edit* Lowered to two stars after laughable trustpilot response. Did you even read a thing I said? It's been two months and absolutely no progress has been made aside from claiming I am in queue that lasts 1-2 weeks when it's been 8. Everytime I reach out its more and more infuriating. I've reached out to you through your automated system, through your ticket system, through your chat system, and through trustpilot. Now you wish me to reach you via twitter? No thanks."

The transition required much more input from me that I hadn't expected, and wasn't very confident in my abilities. I thought from my initial conversations that Dreamhost would be in charge of the change over details. Probably a misunderstanding from the outset when I signed up. Now that we're up and running your site is easy for me to navigate and the more current version of Wordpress is easier for me to make price changes. I would absolutely recommend Dreamhost to someone, but I'd make sure they'd know they'd have a role to play in the transition."

I had download all files and re-upload my website to reinstate it. Time consuming, considering it's a hobby! Expensive, too. Had to pay upfront due to automated payment systems, and then be reimbursed afterwards.If on their Shared Server and your website causes \"server load\" issues (either due to crawlers and bots, which can't be blocked until they start causing a problem, or due to a temporary surge in popularity), they will simply disable your site until it is under control. In most cases reactivating it is easy enough, but it depends on the support person and their experience."

The support system is very dated and limited. On each ticket you raise, they reply in a completely new Post, not quoting your original one which makes it hard to track. Their email system as well works in a weird manner. If you set an auto-forwarder, it does not actually save a copy of the email but rather forward the email to the new destination, so you have no copy. All in all, it's a decent host which I would recommend to people with basic projects but if you need advance tools and support, this is not it."

This was not the case for 4 months and I was billed for my old and new services. When I contacted their billing department I was met with a man named Trueman, who was cobative and had a SEVERE lack of customer service experience. (I am being nice here as the majority of customer support there are really good but it takes one sour apple.)Trueman informed me that it was my fault entirely! And clearly stated I will not get a refund for this. (Still have not received my refund.)  Now the best bit, he informed me that I am now leaving dreampress, so I am. This was an appalling experience, I was not expecting this at all, especially after all of my prior experiences with dreampress customer support being honest and in good faith.

Basically, the site was so large and complex that the shared server we had moved to was being overwhelmed. Eventually we moved it to a virtual private server and all is now well. The reason I\u2019m not giving a five-star review is that the migration team should have done more to ensure that we were moving to a properly-configured server. If that work had been done, we could have avoided the downtime and significant revenue loss that we experienced.This should be part of every migration prior to starting. If there was a way for the team to determine the resources being used on an existing WordPress installation, compare that with the destination server, and ensure that the migrated site is going to run efficiently on the new server, it would go a long way toward resolving issues during large site migrations."

Their panel while it works fine is not very user friendly.There were some other things like I was checking upgrade possibilities and wham I sign up for a new contract without actually authorizing a payment or seeing a final confirmation screen. The support eventually cancelled my mistaken order.When I canceled my plan this year neither did I receive a refund for the last remaining month nor was I able to actually keep my website running until my contract ended. They would with one click just end my hosting even though I paid for a full year. I expected them to keep my plan running until my contract runs out. I already transferred my website so I probably wont bother complaining about it to them but I found this to be rather customer unfriendly.The last year I had several outages when my website was not available. Sometimes I did not even find any information on their website or Twitter. Downtimes seemed to have increased in 2022.In the end Dreamhost Shared Wordpress is just very slow and not worth the money.

I was hoping that I would be hiring a technical support staff that would work with me and my customized needs, but mostly I receive a \"we won't talk about that\" or \"we don't support custom configurations\".  While that is indicative of the industry, I was hoping for more with DreamHost.  I'm not an *nix Admin, but I am forced to become one, because of a couple of custom configurations that I must have.\r Bottom line: good prices and good services, average technical support."

          "Titre": "Good value and fairly reliable, but more teething issues than expected",
          "Contenu": "I turned to Dreamhost because I needed to host a Canadian domain alongside British and some global .com. Not all hosts support all of these particularly ones in Europe and UK. Dreamhost does.There are loads of hosts that I could have gone to. Dreamhost was amongst a few with a good reputation. Their pricing was also good and about the only one that had fair pricing over a number of years. Not unsustainably cheap for first 12 months followed by the trauma of a price hike month 13 and the inconvenience of shifting everything away.So I was pleased to sign up with DH and figured this could be a longer term relationship. However there are a few issues which have caused inconvenience.Firstly I assumed that DH would offer all of what other hosts offer and more. One such feature would be multiple FTP accounts. This way I can offer a log in to a content producer which allows them limited access to parts of a website. I was amazed to understand I'm limited to one account per domain which means I'd have to share access to an entire website, or temporarily limit it and then share my password with someone else. Really can't believe it.It doesn't end there. Whilst trying to set up FTP access via Dreamweaver I kept entering details and was told password incorrect or FTP problem. Kept trying. Found it locked ALL my accounts from FTP access not just new one. Figured it was a system level problem Eventually contacted support, which is at least good. Seemed I'd been locked out for some reason, Not explained.I also find the whole dashboard really overwhelming. There are definitely serious usability issues which keep users on their toes to understand exactly what's going on. I often end up going around in circles even when I've just seconds before seen an option I now want to select. For example getting a security thing for the domain. It happens to be on its own option but I'd seen it somewhere else and couldn't then find it when I wanted to apply for a new domain.Further, when setting up password for FTP access, the whole process is simply wrong. Instead of inviting user to enter a new password, the only option is to Change. This makes no sense if you've not already set one up. And if you have other accounts, you start to think it's using same password from a different domain which it is not. Clicking Change and entering a NEW one then results in an absurdly long process. Should be 1 second but more like over a minute!Once set up, I believe everything works ok. Support is quick to respond and have resolved all issues so far which not all hosts do. Unfortunately DH falls short of 5 stars by my book, because the setup process and general maintenance options could be vastly improved. A lot of this simply comes down to rethinking the whole dashboard, doing some user research with actual customers, and asking how to improve the experience.I suppose the problem in my case is I'm not a daily visitor to DH dashboard. If I was I'd probably fathom the whole thing and understand all of the quirks to the point of being indifferent to them. But I'd guess a lot of DH customers are people who set up a single site and are therefore infrequent users.I plan to continue with DH but as usability is such a big deal and DH have a massive population of customers, then I'd expect them to invest effort into either improving the UI, or offering at least two levels. Oh and some additional functionality like multiple FTP accounts; not rocket science."

You can only reach the team via a message board and on occasions messages marked as high priority are not pickup up for over 24 hours. \r The technical abilities of the support team members varies greatly, they seem  to employ a round robin approach to support queries, therefore when you send a reply the next support again has little clue on what the previous agent might have done. Some agents are super stars others are black holes and are to be avoided.\r - With the DreamPress service they employ a varnish cache, which can cause more trouble than it's worth with caching some ajax requests etc.. and this can not be disabled. \r - When signing up you don't get a temporary domain to use, so migrating your live site can be challenging to minimize downtime.\r Overall good but when your sites down you just want to speak to an agent to fix the problem."

The custom control panel is pretty good, once you get used to it (though it could do with a facelift).\r 2.Uptime is excellent. I have had consistent 99.9+% uptime for both my sites.\r 3.Support is fast and prompt, both via email and Twitter (except when it isn't, but more on this later).\r 4.Cloudflare Railgun for free on wen hosting accounts!\r 5.Excellent integration with Cloudflare and Google PageSpeed (more on Cloudflare later)\r 6.The servers have SSDs, so your website should technically load faster.\r So, all in all DreamHost is pretty good! BUT, there are some really big issues that I *hope* DreamHost will fix soon. Here they are,\r 1.Response times of both my websites are consistently >0.2s, 0.2s being the upper threshold that Google PageSpeed Insights recommends for quick loading websites. This was never an issue with my previous host - JustHost, even though they used rotating HDDs and DreamHost uses SSDs. DreamHost's response to it was basically, \"meh, can't help. Upgrade to VPS or DreamPress.\"\r 2.The development team is an absolute nightmare. Here's the thing. A couple of weeks after signing up, I turned on Cloudflare Plus ($10/mo) for one of my domains. Two of the best features of this plan are image lazy loading (Mirage) and image compression (Polish). But for some reason, neither feature worked on my website. After a bit of hunting around, I found that these features were getting automatically disabled from DreamHost's panel. I immediately contacted support and asked them to fix it, because I was being billed for Cloudflare Plus. Turned out the support team couldn't fix the bug, so they transferred it to the development team. That was back in the first week of May, a FULL MONTH AGO. I am yet to hear from the dev team. There is no known way of contacting them - you can only ask the support team about the status, and they have literally no idea when or if the dev team will fix the issue. \r   I still like DreamHost and will continue to host with them for the remaining period of my current cycle, but they really need to tame that wild dev team and fix whatever is keeping the response times down, or else I am a goner."

I should think that they perform very well for sites smaller than ours - even though they claim to be able to handle larger databases.\r This is really more an ambition than it is a reality - since it is clear that the larger sites suffer under load.\r If they could get this right at a optimised server level - the DreamPress could be truly fantastic value for money.\r But like all hosting there is a shortage of MySql Tuning expertise in this space.\r One more push and they could be great.\r 6-8-2015 - Update\r I have been experiencing server error 503 issues with 3 sites for 2 weeks and have had a ticket about the matter open for the last 4 days awaiting a fix.\r It seems as if the servers are not configured correctly - which should be a very basic issue to resolve for a web host.\r To re-iterate - the smaller sites we have hosted experience no such problems - hence there is a direct correlation between the increased size of the hosted content and the number of server crashes.\r There is a continued resistance to understand this relationship....and the required server tuning.\r We joined with Dreamhost because of their claim that the DreamPress 2 service can handle larger databases AND they understand Wordpress.\rThere is clearly a flaw in this offer from my experience and I am keen to work through a solution before exploring my options.\r I have had another Ticket outstanding for 13 days.\r Clearly the response from Dreamhost contradicts what has been said below."

          "Contenu": "When I was first with Dreamhost - support was solid, hosting was steady, uptime was good. The UI was luxurious, and they really felt like they'd hold a high position in the world of consumer and freelancer centric hosting companies.I normally don't write reviews, especially negative ones, but I have had a relationship with this company for far too long to just ghost them. This is my opinion from my experiences with them, and you may have a different relationship. -IN FACT- I saw a review from someone else who started with them in 2001 (same year as me) that has a 5 star review with opposing points!tl;dr - if you're looking to host a simple site, a couple email addresses, buy a domain, and have a CDN - all in one spot - and need something that looks prettier than CPanel but has a similar disjointed UX - Dreamhost can do that, but I don't feel the bang for the buck is there (comparing to others). If you need multiple sites, want to use platforms like Wordpress (without investing in the Dreampress plans), or just do anything more than what was first mentioned, they're not a good fit.I have been with Dreamhost for over 15 years. I've migrated clients to them. I have set friends and family up with accounts. I've hosted many personal sites with them. I've seen their changes in guard, newsletters, and company voice. Mostly, I've been subject to it being less about a dream, and more about sleeping on the job. About five years ago, it was cemented with me that I could not host any site that needed consistent uptime with them. Low traffic, \"address and phone number\" type website for a friends business, sure. Nephew's programming project, absolutely. Ecommerce - no way. Any client site, absolutely not (even comparing dreampress to dedicated WP hosts - comparing apples to apples here).For the entire time I have been with Dreamhost there were regular jokes by customers about needing to move their hosting to whoever Dreamhost uses for Dreamhoststatus.com - the only site that seems to have reliable uptime. Uptime is a difficult word to argue, while a site may be \"servable\" Dreamhost has gotten extremely aggressive about 500 Server errors - which, to me, means downtime.Why I have spent the past two years looking for other hosting options (that's why they're not marked \"BAD\" - I found worse), and the last two months migrating everyone and everything I've put with DreamHost away to other options:- Their proprietary control panel used to be something that helped them stand out in a positive way. Now, it's clunky. It's limiting, and that panel has moved away from customer service and account maintenance to sales tools and discouraging migrating away. It makes sense for their business, just not for the customer.- They used to be the cheap place to get a domain. They're not even competitive anymore.- They used to be fast, now I can expect 500 server errors just installing Wordpress themes - much less for editing sites.- They are behind the times in features like backups, malware protection, and staging sites- 500 errors and downtime- Stingy and secretive with resources, which makes sense for shared hosting, but is probably what causes all the downtime - and maybe there are too many shares on a single server, I don't know. I didn't even know that this was a thing until I started working with and trialing other hosts.Pros:- Their Cloudflare integration is solid/better than CPanel native one.- The UI is still pretty. (If you use CPanel, you'll hate it - nothing is \"where it should be\" - if you hate CPanel, you'll love it)- Domain Management is easy.- I've NEVER had a billing dispute nor grievance with them.I think Dreamhost is trying to be all things to everyone, and not accomplishing that. I feel that if Dreamhost can decide who their customer is, they can get their product in line and thrive again. *When I started, it felt like a consumer-accessible hosting company that would grow with you - and the ethical player that would end godaddy; now it's too tough for the little guy (and too much money), and too feature weak for real customers."

I've hosted a few professional eCommerce portals without any major issues. The reason why I departed and why they don't get a 5-star: significant price increases for renewals over the years, slight drop in service quality, and an attempt to charge me for a service I didn't ask for. After moving my professional high-traffic websites elsewhere and leaving only the smaller ones, that resulted in that for my use case DreamHost became too expensive. Still, even if they're not for me, overall they are the best managed hosting service I ever worked with."

As I felt I could manage the whole thing without incurring additional costs, It took me about 10 back-and-forth tickets and a few days, to make this happen. The tech staff were always helpful and responsive. But in hindsight, I should have paid $100 to let them manage the whole process.

After many years being with DreamHost I can only give them 4 stars, the fifth star was lost when I found out that my website was hosted with another company.  The company only works office hours Mon-Fri-0830_1700 which is no good to anyone who has a business to run and encounters difficulties looking for answers. Now I have to wait until the office opens to find out if my website is lost OR alive. I am praying for the latter."

This time around, I had a complex issue (a firewall update broke our support system) and Dreamhost's customer support strategy backfired somewhat.  Their system ensures a quick response to your inquiries by moving support cases to representatives who can respond within an hour or two.  In this case, I ended up speaking to about 20 different representatives over the course of two months, each of whom had to go get themself up-to-date on a complicated issue.  Eventually the ticket was escalated -- some kind of exception was made so that I could have a slower (12-24 hour response time) conversation but with the same representative.  This person was able to get the full details and resolve the problem.  I just wish it hadn't taken so long to get to that point."

What would have earned a 5-star review from me is clearer communication up front from DreamHost about the whole process. It involved several steps that resulted in strange, unexpected things popping up in my DreamHost panel, with no clarification that these things were only temporary. Also, the Dreamhost bot generated automated emails that sent me false information, such as telling me I needed to create a new password by following a link, which did not work, and then when I asked about this, I was told to ignore the email. It would be better if the email wasn't sent\u2014or if DreamHost drafted up a primer for the customer that outlined the steps to be expected, including the one where an email would appear that you should ignore. The DreamHost guys knew exactly what they were doing, and they competently accomplished the task in the end\u2014but for several days I was wondering if something had gone bad at DreamHost, like what's happening over at the bird site. Thankfully, this is not at all true, and I'm thrilled to now have all my domains and websites over at Dreamhost. I remain a fan."

After the transfer of web hosting and domain hosting, updating my sites, and contacting customer/tech support a few times I can 100% say I am impressed AND very glad I moved to Dreamhost.  I am VERY happy with their services and highly recommend."

I struggled through 3 versions of my website, couldn't get it to look how I wanted, plus it was very slow loading and user experience was poor. They re-did it with a similar look and feel but WAY better, cleaner, faster, with small features that I would never figure out. Really good communication the whole time. I was able to provide input up front (you fill out questions and select templates) and then we iterated a bit during the process. It was very easy to work with the team and I'm thrilled with the results. For someone who is not a website person, this service was a steal for $499. It saved me DAYS of ineffective work, so I could work on things I should be doing for my business. Highly recommend!!"
