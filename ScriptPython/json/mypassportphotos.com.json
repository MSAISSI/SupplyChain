But I wasn't able to receive a refund from ivisa etc. Moving forward, I know what to do and to just visit my local CVS store to obtain a passport photo etc. Which I did and still save $ and at CVS I was able to get a great discount and only paid $5 there. I have no issue with ivisa, mypassport.com. I just went to alternative route and use other services for a passport photo in person."

Then, when I asked for a refund, they tried to tell me they filed it with the government already and they can't refund my $4.09 because of it! They did not file PHOTOS with the government! What a silly reason to lie about to avoid a refund. Then when I told him this, he reluctantly refunded me $3.68, when the order was $4.09 to begin with! Worst experience I've ever had with anything. Terrrible service you have there. Wow! Got it done at Walmart no problem."

However, the reason being is because not every drugstore accepts payments online. You are emailed this information after your purchase & should be reimbursed. The pictures are printed out in a 4x6 picture with outlines to help you cut each individual photo.

I wasn't told that I would have to cut the photo out by myself until my order was ready for pick up, so that was a little disappointing to find out. I also didn't realize that they would charge a printing fee at the store ($0.43). However, customer service refunded me the fee within 3 hrs of my request! I paid extra so that my picture would be compliant with the Chinese visa application, and that worked out. Also, they gave me two pictures instead of one so that was nice."
