I paid for one day shipping for I can avoid getting my product later than expected. The one day shipping did not live up to expectations (guarantee one day shipping). It Is arriving later than expected. In that case it should follow under 2-3 days shipping instead of one. Once again, I paid $164.42 and it is not a fair act of service and didnt not live up to the date arrival. I was not given any updates, change of times, it said it would arrive on January 11, 2021, it is now January 12th therefore Marks as 2+ days   shipping. As I am still tracking my order I am aware and disappointed that I continue to as of now see change of dates arrival. It is only fair I recieve a refund for the one business day. It is now on day 2. Thos is what i sent them they steal your money and lie. These people are scams."

The manufacturing was horrible.  Believe it or not, this is the great part of the story. I attempted to reach out to the manufacturer and recent less than no help.  The actually confirmed they seen this many times but deem this as \"damaged\" not a \"defect\".  Direct quote from customer service \"We are not obligated to replace a damaged product, and we are not obligated to accept a return of your product if it was damaged by you.\" So, a polite go screw. Actual email thread from customer support:Hello, As I have stated, the product comes with a 1 year warranty. If you believe this is a defect, XIM Technologies can examine the product and determine if they agree. However, we have seen this issue happen a number of times. If the product is removed at an angle from the console, it can cause excess friction on the USB port and cause separation from the device. As this was damaged during use, we can not replace the product. Your credit card company may provide a 'damage warranty' (some CC companies do) and it may be worth investigating with them to see if that is the case. We are not obligated to replace a damaged product, and we are not obligated to accept a return of your product if it was damaged by you. We are sorry that your product got damaged. XIM Technologies does offer a repair service, and may be willing to do so a price that is far lower than the cost of a new item. Sincerely, Flashback Limited"

I would like to know if somebody came across such a situation and what to do. I bought xim apex on flashbackltd.com. I'm from Russia. ahead of the questions I will explain that we sell it at 30% more expensive, even taking into account the delivery. I made a choice in favor of this store. The delivery is very fast, but it is more the merit of postal services. I ordered this device for shooting a review in one of the Russian-speaking gaming communities. but before the detailed review there had to be a video about unpacking and the first impression, as well as a comparison with hori tac pro. This was done in order to publish this review in the xim user group and attach a referral link for further receiving small bonuses. I attach the link to the failed video. why did it fail? because there was no device inside. only hub however, he was in 2 packs (!). Perhaps this is done to correct the weight of the parcel. I will say in advance that at the customs in Russia and at the postal service they assured me that the parcel had not been opened, otherwise 2 acts would have been drawn up. I also checked the integrity of the outer packaging at the post office. I dropped the video to the support service, but a few days later they said that it was not their problem and they were fine. they refused to solve the problem in any way. They didn\u2019t answer the question of shipping insurance. Actually the topic: 1. Is there an opportunity to complain to this site and return the money? what to do and where to write? 2. Never buy there. below the video. most likely you will not understand anything, but this is not necessary. without words everything is clear.You can look at video, search on YouTube xim apex Flashbackltd"

When I emailed to the Customer service representative, I was under the impression that they would ship a replacement part, even though I wouldn\u2019t recieve it when I needed it, i still accepted that offer. A few days later I received  an email saying my money had been refunded. All in all, I received my fan about 3 weeks after I actually needed it. As someone who works in the e-commerce business, I was very disappointed with my experience here."

I\u2019m taking off another star because if you try to move completely horizontally to the right, the cursor will also move down as you move to the right. The opposite is done when you move to the left, the cursor moves up along with it. One more complaint I have is in the game Rainbow Six Siege. If you are sprinting forward and press Q or W, you will stop sprinting and walk forward in that direction. You are usually able to continue sprinting in a diagonal direction when doing this on both pc and Xbox."
