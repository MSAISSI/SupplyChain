          "Titre": "I was considering another service..",
          "Contenu": "I originally was going to use another authentication method for my applications until I came across KeyAuth, I believe I had already seen it before as I had a login already and at the time I don\u2019t think I needed an authentication so I simply forgot about it. Well not anymore, the service comes with 3 total plans; tester, developer, and seller, the first thing I\u2019d like to mention is that the tester plan is completely free with detailed documentation on how to implement KeyAuth into a wide range of different programming languages like C#, C++, Javascript, Python, and a lot more. Typically what sets apart authentication methods for me is for one, the security it provides for me and my users and two, does the service seem to have a structured place of giving information to new users, for me it is their Discord server as I use Discord the most so them having one that looks great and is not all over the place is very good, on top of that they have support bots within the server which you can direct message and it\u2019s pretty much a ticket system, this is incredibly helpful because being able to reach out if you encounter any issues is such a great thing to provide so props for that. Saying that, Discord is not their only means of community in fact they also have a Telegram, their own forums which people can and have posted a wide variety of helpful information. The fact that I haven\u2019t even talked about the prices they ask for on their developer and seller plan speaks volumes about the detail they provide in their service, the developer plan comes in at $10 USD with a wide range of different positives that aren\u2019t on the tester plan such as unlimited logs, unlimited files, a we hook system to hide your webhook url calls from bad actors, their file system as it allows to download files securely and if you want to hide sensitive information or code you don\u2019t want the user to see then you can simple load it into memory which, even though it is not within the scope of their service, they provide links to stackoverflow info how this is exactly done. As such the developer plan is leagues better than the free tester plan, which typically is the case but the interesting plan is their Seller Plan which is double the money but you also gain all developer features with an increase of 25MB of file storage and gain access to their Seller API and access to use a Discord bot with their system to generate tokens and whatnot.All-in-all, I will definitely be using this service for all of my authentication needs as it just far exceeds the competition and I know that there are other alternatives that may even but better but to that I just must say that KeyAuth\u2019s detailed step-by-step allows literally anyone to securely provide safe and secure authentication to their users, whatever use-case it may be which is far more support than you may get from other services and any errors or issues I had with implementing it into my own program, their support is ready to help which is quite refreshing as it typically takes a while to get responses most of the time.Another point to add that I forgot, KeyAuth is completely open-sourced meaning practically anyone can view the code and or improve upon it. This means that there are a multitude of people thy can view and inspect the code they are trusting their users with and can go a long way, especially for me, in making someone purchase.Discord: Legend Modz#1337 or thatladlegend with their new username system."

You (the admin) also have lots of freedom to manage users. you can ban, change password, create variables to access from the client and there is also a live chat for you users in you app in the latest example. Keep in mind Keyauth also has a #code channel on their discord server where users upload free code examples you can use. Overall All my programs are way better with KeyAuth and I've give it a 10/10.- ShadowMonster#2247"
