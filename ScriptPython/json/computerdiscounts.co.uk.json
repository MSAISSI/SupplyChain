          "Contenu": "Recommend you stay clear of buying anything from this company. If you have issues they only send you \"How-to-Geek\" suggested solutions. They are reluctant to take the product back to address the issues identified and even when they do, the same issues exist when you receive it back. Issues arose 5 months into the 12 month warranty period for a MacBook Pro13 and they basically ran down the remaining 7 months without providing a fix and then advised us to take it up with Apple directly, as their warranty had expired. Not an ethical company to deal with - stay clear!"

Beware!P.s. I note that you have replied saying you\u2019ve given a full refund as though that resolves the matter. It doesn\u2019t. With the cost of returning the faulty laptop, it has now cost me \u00a3411 for this awful experience and you still haven\u2019t replied to the pre court notice. I still haven\u2019t received the refund so I\u2019m still an extra \u00a3170 out of pocket, that\u2019s \u00a3581 - which is more than the cost of the laptop."

          "Contenu": "I bought a macbook pro (\u00a3864.99) from this company in late 2020 and received a really faulty product. Despite their promise that it would function as new, the macbook had a damaged screen and only a 45 minute battery life. I had to really fight for a replacement and 18 months later, that too is completely unusable. The battery life has drastically declined and it gets SO HOT that I can't use it, to be honest it's DANGEROUS. I've repeatedly asked them for a replacement or refund and implicated my legal rights as a consumer. Every email I send is answered with the same obstructive line about how my \"12 month warranty has expired\" and they are refusing to address anything I say about my consumer rights. It's deeply frustrating and unfortunately it seems that my only option is pursue legal action. Just bite the bullet and buy new, you'll be thankful that you did!Edit: Update in response to the reply they've given me below. You can clearly see a great example here of how they are refusing to acknowledge my consumer rights and are instead stonewalling me by constantly referring back to the expired warranty (which does not affect my rights as a consumer). Replacing a faulty product with another faulty product is not a viable solution. I have rejected the product for a refund, which I am entitled to do under the consumer rights act. REGARDLESS OF THE EXPIRED WARRANTY. Refusing to process that return is an obstruction of my rights. Please do not buy from this company."

          "Contenu": "Do not buy from this company!I ordered a laptop from computer discounts and because they failed to label it correctly it didn\u2019t get delivered. The second delivery failed because the delivery driver didn\u2019t read the delivery instructions and so it had to be delivered a third time. I had to take 2.5 days off work to deal with it at a loss of \u00a3300 to myself and have also been charged \u00a336 for phoning DHL express to try and track the delivery. Computer Discounts have refused to do anything to resolve this, refused to disclose their complaints procedure, refused to give other legally requested information, refused to answer or give a phone call, reply only by e-mail and do not address the issue raised but just fob off the customer. There is no customer care, no after sales support and no way to make a complaint or to have any issues addressed properly. I\u2019m not sure if they have a head office or not or just a warehouse with a couple of staff but if they do have a head office they refuse to give details for it. Even after involving Trading Standards they are refusing to give the legally requested information or to attempt any resolution. I just want to warn others so they don\u2019t have to go through the same miserable experience I did. 2.5 days spent waiting for and tracking delivery, hours of phone calls, a whole load of stress, \u00a3336 out of pocket plus the cost of the laptop at \u00a3500+I also noticed they had the exact same laptop/exact same specification advertised for a lower price elsewhere on their website and when I\u2019ve looked on other sites subsequently the exact same spec laptops are available at lower prices and some with next day delivery. So this firm is not the best value, not the most efficient and give no or appalling customer service. Please look elsewhere before using them."

It didn\u2019t have the serial number at the bottom, the mouse pad was not working as a normal macbook and the screen was so fragile. I was so disappointed as that was not a real MacBook nor a refurbished one. Although I had to pay the shipments I sent it back the same day and asked a refund which arrived within one week, which was really good. Also they were really responsive to my emails. Nonetheless the worst place to buy, as I got very scared since I paid such a big amount of money for being messed up with."

I have received the same response verbatim on several occasions.  After waiting over a week for a replacement or acknowledgment that they had received the damaged computer, they simply stopped responding to emails altogether.  Only when threatened with legal action did they acknowledge my correspondence and supposedly issued a refund.  This can all be backed up with emails.  Since writing this, I have been inundated with correspondence from them begging me to edit my review of my experience, promising me a 'gift' if I complied.Having just read some of the other reviews on this company I was surprised to learn that they had tried to discredit their reviews with Trustpilot as well.

Open the box and the laptop is scratched to all hell and will not work if it is not plugged in as it doesn't hold its charge. Requested to refund and we agreed a courier would come on the 18th to collect so took the day off work. Found out on the 18th that the courier wasnt coming till the today so I asked them why and they tell me that DPD advised they could not collect till the 19th.. so why did no one tell me? I could have gone to work and I am a frontline a&e worker so getting the day off wasnt easy! Collection should have been today so because I couldnt have another day off work my mum did and I got notification to say it had been collected by DPD local.. it hasnt its still here in my house! So disappointed. I wont hold my breath for getting my refund. Customer services are kind but thats the only good thing to say about this company.

He's a child and it was his first computer, so we thought a refurbished computer was the best option, as it's cheaper. This company had good reviews, so we decided to go with them. Mistake.We received the computer quickly and it was well packaged. The first thing we realised was that everything was a different make: the tower, screen and screen stand. Not a big problem, but it did look quite cheap.The mouse and keyboard were light, cheap plastic. By looking at them we knew we would have to replace them soon.When we plugged it, we realised that the PC's language was set to French. Luckily, we are French speakers, so it was not a problem (other than the fact it was not what we had ordered), but we thought this could have been problematic for a different family. The computer was fairly slow to boot, but my son was so happy with his gift that he did not find it frustrating.We bought the PC for my son to play Minecraft. While he was playing in the evening of Christmas day, the computer's screen went black and a message appeared. It read : A disk read error occurred Press Ctrl + Alt + Del to restart. When we restarted, the same message appeared.I emailed Computer Discounts, to ask them what to do. They had no clue. They told me I should go and fiddle with System preferecences and reboot windows. I had no access to Windows. Some friends of mine are computer engineers. I asked them what to do and they said the disk was faulty (and that the people who refurbished the computer probably knew it) and there was nothing to be done, it needed binned and changed.The kerfuffle began. I think we must have exchanged about 70 emails. They would not answer my questions, they would write in such poor English that understanding what they meant was at times impossible. I wanted to talk on the phone, but they refused to give me a phone number.I live in Scotland. They told me that in order to return the computer, I would have to arrange my own courier, because their courier only deals with mainland UK. I had to write an email explaining to an adult that Scotland is indeed in mainland UK. Who are these people? A joke.The emails they sent me are so unbeliveable that I've kept them. If you want to have a look at them, contact me, a few weeks after the event, they're funny. Not at the time, though. At one point, they even told me how much margin they make on each computer, and explained that by organising the courier themselves, they would be making no money out of this sale. Why should I worry about this? How unprofessional!They also told me they 'expected my kind understanding' several times. Cheek! They are so aware of how ridiculous they look that at least three times they felt the need to add to their email 'we are a legitimate company'. Who does that but unprofessional dodgy businesses? It's like dealing with kids who'd be selling fake raffle tickets.It took days to arrange for their faulty computer to be sent away. I commend my wife who managed to understand their emails in spite of their lack of basic English writing skills. Weeks later, we were fully refunded, and went to a proper computer dealer and bought a proper computer. It works, looks good and sturdy. Because of this joke of a 'company' my son was so disappointed on Christmas day, but he is happy now.Do not buy from them, they are a farce.Edit: I was wondering how they get such good reviews. Yesterday, they sent me an email, offering me \u00a310 to remove my negative review. Why not a Mars bar, or some marbles? This must be a bad BTEC project, surely. Legitimate companies don't pay to keep their customers misinformed. You don't need to have attended business school to know that that's a really dodgy marketing technique.People who do this don't hesitate to write their own positive reviews. Stay away."

And now that line has turned into a solid 2inch band and they cant help me because it's beyond their contract, even though the problem started early on and I notified them."

I reported this but was told it is a 'software problem' and not covered by the warranty. So I had to research and try to repair it all for myself. I have since learned that the Core 2 CPU is old hat these days and the SFF itself has limited upgrade potential, unless I buy Dell products. The company ignored my requests for advice in upgrading and refused to swap the unit for a similarly cost, better performance model. I shall not be using this company again. Too iffy by far."

When I contacted their customer services to complain of these issues, I was told that all of these faults are \"standard for refurbished machines\"!

          "Contenu": "I do believe that this company is an honest seller. However there were a number of issues with my purchase. I purchased a refurbished Mac Book Air online on 14th December. When checking out the website advised that I would receive my order on 17th December. It was a Christmas present so this was fine. As I hadn't heard from them by the 17th I emailed customer service to be advised that it would be dispatched on the 18th December for delivery on 21st December. Again I heard nothing from them so emailed (There is no customer service telephone number so all communication is done by email) them on the 21st to be advised 'Good news, your order will be dispatched on 26th December for delivery on 29th December'. Obviously this would have been a disaster so some heated emailing then took place. Eventually the order was actually delivered on 23rd December so disaster averted! On delivery I opened the parcel to find a Mac Book Air in great condition. I did not start it up. So on Christmas day when the gift was opened it quickly became apparent that the advertised operating system had not been installed and instead an ancient OS was on there that would not load or run many apps or streaming services. It was also impossible to upgrade to a more up to date OS. After a few more email exchanges (response rates always very quick) they agreed to give me a refund. This came through today. This was my first (and probably last) foray into refurbed IT purchases and really wasn't great. The upshot was a lot of stress pre delivery and a disappointed child on Christmas day. They will not speak to you after you have placed your order but are always quick to respond to email enquiries. As stated I do believe they are a genuine seller and the customer service was good. However my overall experience has been poor as the product advertised was not what I received."

Item arrived on the Friday so I didn\u2019t have to wait as long as expected so that was awesome I was so pleased.Overall a great product and a quick service with clear communication when asked.The MacBook Pro was in good condition some scratches which is expected but that\u2019s what covers are for.Maybe moving forward look at way to update the customer saying the item has been picked, checking, then in quality assurance.Customers like to know where there items are and at what stage so just a minor development point."

I already own an iPad mini 3 purchased in 2014 that is up-to-date and runs on IOS 12.4.6.  However, the battery is beginning to have problems and the machine itself has to be reconnected to my broadband after any short interval of inactivity.  This new, refurbished iPad runs on IOS 9.3.5 and is obviously an earlier version of my 2014 machine.  This means that it is not compatible with iCloud which is not a problem for me but I wonder about its security.  I am happy with its speed and it has no problems with maintaining its broadband connection but I wonder if it will no longer have software updates and therefore become more susceptible to malware.  Your reassurance would be helpful.  Cheers.Mike Dobbie"

I have a US keyboard, but the key function is UK.  That's okay for me, as I know where the functions are (you could also change the function to US if you need the function to do what's printed on the key).  However, I have to use an alternative keyboard for a backslash (which I currently don't have to use often).My laptop was excellent value for money and I'm very happy with it."

I would have expected to find this on the order page (a tooltip next to delivery of the checkout page would have done); it wasn't in the FAQs either.So A) I didn't know for sure that the order has been received/dispatched and B) I had no idea how long it would be before it was likely to be delivered, that could have been 2 day, a week or even two weeks!I am an eCommerce consultant so might being slightly critical but these two things together did impact my experience of using the site."

When I contacted the warehouse and explained the problem of cables not marching with the computer monitor and that computer monitor which I ordered was widescreen and the included was not. They were not helpful, if only they suggested okay what about the other items. I would have told them, okay but can you resend the correct cables that connect the desktop with the correct widescreen monitor. That should have resolved the matter, but he insisted that what what they were asked to deliver. Can I then have my refund and return the computer. The ware house its not their business to arrange that. I should speak to the sale department. I tried several times to contact options 1, and 2 many times I cannot speak to anyone to till now that I am writing this feed. I have written many more emails without any positive feedback. I hope they would improve in their communication eith on chat, phone or email. Thanks"

          "Contenu": "I bought a refurbished MacBook Air from this company. Most aspects of the purchase were very good - the website, order, speed of dispatch and hitting the target delivery date, which was just 3 days from when I ordered it I think. The packaging was good and the laptop itself was in good condition. An issue arose when I tried to install MS Office using my Office 365 Family Subscription - I couldn\u2019t. It turned out the reason I couldn\u2019t was because the laptop was running the MacOS called High Sierra. Office won\u2019t install on anything older than Cortana and Cortana won\u2019t install on any MacBook older than 2012. Unbeknown to me was that the refurbished laptop was 10 years old (2011). That\u2019s not a problem in itself but if I\u2019d known, I would not have purchased it, and the problem is that the age of the laptop was not stated anywhere in the product description. I returned the laptop at a cost of \u00a322 postage. The returns process was perfect - their customer service is brilliant. I just think they should give all the facts about their refurbished equipment rather than wait for customers to discover important information after they\u2019ve purchased."

I am impressed and would recommend Computer Discount unreservedly.  Mrs Carole Kirsopp."

          "Contenu": "Excellent service at point of sale and delivery, and great first impressions!I am cynical about online offers - if it looks too good to be true, then it usually is. However, on this occasion I was proved wrong. I put my faith in Computer Discounts and they didn't let me down. I've had my new (refurbished) MacBook Air 2017 for 2 weeks now and can honestly say it was a very positive experience buying from this company. The initial questions I had were answered by email promptly and clearly. I was kept informed about the process of preparation and delivery. The delivery was fast - 48 hours to an off-shore UK island. The laptop was in superb condition and easy to set up. So far, I am impressed. I say \"so far\" because I can't yet comment on any after-service processes or responses; I hope not to have to need to tbh.My only slight observation is that the packaging very clearly stated what was inside. I was a little surprised that it was so obvious as surely any \"loss\" in transit wouldn't be covered by their insurance if they are declaring to all who handle it (or trustingly leave it with a neighbour or in a \"safe place\" on delivery if you're out) that there is an expensive computer/device in the box; I'd expected it to be more discreet. Also sort of gives the game away if you're buying it as a gift for someone you live with.Yep - so far, would fully recommend this company :-)"

          "Contenu": "I was looking for a new laptop for my business similar to my previous model with identical features such as sd card input, a few USB, CD/Video player basically all in one computer but still being portable. The new MacBook Pros 2020 on high street today are out of my pocket and Out of my need. I found a perfect solution after [chatting] with one of the staff at CD on possible options. I was hesitant at first why nobody would pick up the phone after several attempts trying to reach the company. I always prefer a human interaction especially when buying any gadgets, to ask a question as a reassurance for what tech terms means for example....because of that vital to me option was not available I will rate CD a good company. However I did get some limited correspondence and information  via emails regarding the stock, the models and delivery. It took 4 working days to receive my laptop. 2 days to get the order placed, hence absence of \u201chuman touch\u201d.  I highly suggest to implement at least a what's up text and voice messages when possible.Gentleman from the delivery firm came all the way to the 4th floor to hand me in person my order, normally deliveries are left Inside the hall by the front door.Excellent service by the chosen delivery Firm, 5 star to the driver, 5 star for the price of my new MacBookPro that I paid only \u00a3380 for.The product functions very good, So far I am happy with the purchase but I'm still within my 1 year warranty, so time will show how long this type of technology will last. As this is my first time that I bought a used Technology from a third party."
