No white-labeling option for emails (unless you are on an expensive plan, and then you can only use branded emails for 2 clients before needed another expensive plan). Styling and formatting the forms is also limited and/or overly complicated.For simple forms, (name, email, comments) it might be okay (as you can hide the ugly summary), but you still have to live with the spammy-looking, Cognito-branded no-reply email.I have a paid plan, but will stick with my other forms provider."

I've been on their $10/month plan just to remove their \"Powered by Cognito\" on the forms on the clients websites. Now they have increased the price up to $15/month (50%).

          "Contenu": "We fell in love with Cognito forms when we first started building forms. All the options and possibilities are extremely useful and it helped us build a very precise and intelligent form. However, there are some inconveniences... We use our forms in a postsecondary institution in order to schedule exam appointements for students who require accommodations. In our form we built a part for the student, a part for (us) internal reviewing of the request and a last part for the professor to provide exam information. The first problem we encountered was the date rule. We wanted request to be sent 7 days prior to the exam date, but had to remove this rule as we could not override it to accomodate exceptions. Also, we nor the professors could fill or modify the form because of the 7 day restriction. It would prevent resubmission if the modifications were applied outside of the 7 day period.The following issue we encountered had to do with forwarding the forms to the professors. At first, we were able to send them a link with a personalised message directly from cognito form (had to copy/paste the text). However, with the changes made following the addition of \"workflow\", it was no longer possible. We had to generate the link and copy paste it in an email. It didn't look as presentable and was alot more time consuming. In fact, if the email option could be brought back with a possibility to pre-program/automate the message without copy/pasting (while still being able to modify it before sending) that would be perfect. Furthermore, we were hoping to be able to use the different statuses to keep track of the progress of every request/entry. However, it came to our attention that if the status of the entry was changed to anything other than \"incomplete\", the professors were unable to fil their parts of the form (the link would not work). As a matter of fact, if we could have custom status categories and colors, that would be very interesting.Another thing that would have been useful, is the ability to lock/block the student's portion of the form when sent to the professors in order to avoid them changing any information by mistake. This could be a feature that would be controlled internally before sending the link.Very sorry for the length of this feedback. Those are just a few comments and observations that come to mind. We're still new to this platform, so we might observe more and discover other features as we continue to use this product. All in all, very interesting."

A few teething problems down to me learning about formulas and conditional questions, but all sorted now.I highly recommend starting with the free version and see if that will do. My only gripe is it is a bit \"stale\" to look at especially if you want the fonts/colours to match the site. It does go a long way towards it, but it definitely looks like an outside add on.The capture and notification of data received is also really good. The only other reason I moved to a higher package is the cross-referring of data from one form to another to save clients reentering things twice,but I have yet to play with that."

We relied on that form to immediately inform us of new members, their contact and artistic information and their dues.  As we grew tired of creating a \"work-around\", I started to look other places. My personal IT tech suggested trying another forms supplier, specifically Cognito Forms.  In less that 20 minutes, he remotely had it set up for me, and before the day was over, it was seamlessly sending up-to-date member submissions to all who need them.  Not looking back to google for help, again!!"

I used to you a different booking system, but now I exclusively use this.  Like anything, there is a slight learning curve for the first day, but with the help of their staff, I managed to figure out everything I needed.  I can even use these forms to support gift vouchers.  When I want to make new forms, I simply copy an old form and make minor changes to it.  The layout is nice as well.  Customers are much more satisfied with this system.  The price is also much cheaper than other companies.  This is has been a lifesaver for my business.  I just wish I had found this company a few years ago."
