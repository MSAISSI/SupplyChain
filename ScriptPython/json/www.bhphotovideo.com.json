          "Contenu": "I bought a $2500 apple MacBook from B&H new in the box. They said they were an authorized apple reseller. They said unconditional money back guarantee within 30 days on the site. Apple also advertises an unconditional money back guarantee, and I assumed an authorized reseller would match them. I used it for a day and realized the operating system version was not going to be compatible with my legacy software. I tried to return and was pointed to the fine print on the site that says the return is unconditional UNLESS you have opened the seal on the box! That's like offering an unconditional return on a car, unless you drive it off the lot. And Apple will not take the product back if they didn't sell it to you. The internet is full of complaints about exactly this--And it's interesting that they have great reviews on all the sites they link to on their web site, but lousy reviews on Yelp.  Why pay the same price to buy from B&H as from Apple, and take the chance?"

There are other vendors with better customer service (and websites that actually work and update your address when you tell it to).Edit:In response to the reply, this just goes further to show their lack of customer service.  As I said, I did update my address. I did not receive a delivery confirmation until 12/02.  A large company like B&H should sent out a replacement when they ship something to the wrong address. It's not my fault that their ridiculous system seems to want to default to a 20 year old address, even after I have put in my updated address. Funny how they didn't have any trouble collecting payment from the new address, hmm?  Well I can just take my business elsewhere."

All they did was keeping us hanging on the international phone call ( for three days and around 30 minutes every time) knowing that i have confirmed on the credit card info and my bank account joint with my wife. When I wired the money as constructed by YOU, and even before checking on the transaction i got a couple of emails stating that the order was cancelled (I talked to Levi that day and he kept waiting on line for half an hour). This is where I decided to drive to my bank cancel the transfer and suffer more expenses. This is ridiculous and very unprofessional; anyway I am glad I cancelled with you, as I have found better my needs with another supplier."

Therefore, we kindly ask; that if you or a colleague of yours has previously shopped at B&H Photo, whether it was online, over the phone or at our Superstore in NYC, we ask if you can provide us with the details associated with that order.However, if this is your first time shopping with us; we ask respectfully that you provide us with some additional information such as a link to your online profile at Facebook or LinkedIn or a similar page; Alternatively, if you have a work email address with a valid domain replying from it will help expedite the processing of your order.

Fricking order details of another person?Have you ever heard of privacy or is that concept is non-existent in modern America?Am I tripping or even Amazon (a privacy-nightmarish company itself) could not possibly have sent a more outrageous email. Whoever runs your VeRiFiCaTiOn Department, wake up! This is not the way fraud works, this is not the way you treat new customers. They came from your competitors and they can just as easily go back to them!The payment processed just fine when I placed my order. However, it took your VeRiFiCaTiOn Department around 24 hours to suspect the alleged fraud, charge me with another 1$ for nothing and then send me that beautiful email saying I have to prove something to them.What in the name of Christ is that? First experience with this store and the fricking last!UPD. What is even better, they keep charging me 1$ each time they reply to my support request. How cool is that? Oh how ironic, they were worried about the alleged fraud when in fact THEY ARE the real fraud."

I have heard nothing but good things about BH Photo & Video but my first experience buying from them has been the most miserable online shopping experience I can remember. I ordered a Christmas gift for my wife on Monday. I'm in Canada, but not prob- they ship to Canada. Great. The Tracking number only ever told me the shipping label was created. I had no attempt to deliver, nobody to my door, no slip, nothing. I have a smart doorbell so I even checked my log. I get a notification today that my shipment was returned. Then I get an email I got a refund. They decided I returned my order (which I never returned, didn't even receive it!) This is annoying, and obviously when your order gets screwed up you call in to see what's going on. E.g. maybe it was a bug, idk. So I call in just to find out they have no idea what happened. So from here they didn't offer to escalate, look into it, etc. That was literally it. They said you could try to reorder. So, okay. I'm not going to try and reorder when you are so incompetent as an org you can't figure out why my first order returned itself. From here it gets worse because they're not even going to refund me the taxes and duties I paid on it. They just confirmed they won't do it because it was paid to Canadian Gov, even though THEY screwed something up in the order. I did literally nothing other than give them business, and they decide that it's okay to steal from me because they messed up my order. What the heck. They also didn't care that I'm also out money from an FX fee charged by my bank for cross currency transactions. They say it's not in their control. Okay obviously it's not, but when you screw me over with something that is COMPLETELY within your control how dare you not make it right for me and get me those couple of bucks back? Just a total failure in customer support and internal process. If they had someone with a sliver of empathy we could have figured this thing out in five minutes. PS. they still can't tell me what actually happened to the order. I'm literally out $25 because I chose to try and give them business. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"

It's not the $10 its the principle of the matter. They should stand behind thier products and do the right thing.      Update:       Thats great, this has been going on since July 2022, I show proof that the item was returned and they just fought me, denying my refund over and over, until thier bad customer service practices are exposed publicly by my review, then all the sudden they take notice and finally refund me. If no one was watching, they never would have refunded me. It probably cost them way more than $10 in labor for all the months or fighting me and denying my refund for 6 months, certainly wasted a ton of my personal time, ALL OVER $10. Its not the money but the principal. I won't be shopping there again, EVER!"

He put me on hold for 15 minutes and came back to tell me that no, they could not honor that deal. A difference of $20.. really ridiculous. They clearly do not take care of their customers or value them. I also had a bad experience with customer service when I called in the past about my r6 and the military discount they supposedly offered which they would not honor for the camera after being put on hold for a long time for that as well.

For more information please contact the shipper.\" So basically, B&H tells me to contact FedEx, and FedEx tells me to contact B&H. What is especially frustrating is that I noticed the error when the package was right here in Sacramento, where I live. Yet B&H claimed they could do nothing. Thankfully I did not order something more expensive. I will never buy from this company again."

          "Contenu": "I've been a loyal customer of B&H Photo for over two years, and I've always appreciated their wide range of products and excellent customer service. However, my recent experience with their return policy has left me quite disappointed.I purchased 3 rolls of  Canon Heavyweight Matte Coated paper for my Canon 4100, but unfortunately, I realized it was the wrong size. The product was still untouched and sealed in its original box, but because I had cut the tape off the box to inspect the paper, I was told that I couldn't return it. This was surprising and frustrating, especially considering that the product itself was undamaged.I understand the importance of return policies to prevent fraud, but in this case, it felt like B&H Photo was prioritizing policy over customer loyalty and satisfaction. I've spent approximately ten thousand dollars with them over the years, and it's disheartening to see that they weren't willing to accommodate a simple return in this particular instance.What makes this situation even more frustrating is that some of their competitors allow open box returns, which I've always considered a customer-friendly approach. I never thought such a minor issue would be met with such inflexibility from B&H Photo.In the end, I could have easily resealed the box with new tape, and no one would have been the wiser, but I believe in honesty and integrity. I hoped B&H Photo would share those values, especially since the product was in perfect condition.I hope B&H Photo reevaluates their return policy, considering the loyalty and support of their long-time customers. As for me, I'll have to think twice before making future purchases from them, knowing that their return policy might not be as customer-centric as I had previously believed"

Nor is the UNSUBSCRIPTION related to anything I've received. Risible, but true! Is Mr. Posner that clueless?Not really! The company answer is merely a perfunctory, cosmetic response with no bearing on nor resolution of any reality addressed in the complaint.Thus, patently, apathy is the trademark of BHPhoto, while regard for any supposed egregious behavior on their part towards the public is simply not acknowledged. It would have been better to just say: \"We don't care!\"Meanwhile, Cyber Bullying of the public continues, stuffing email boxes full of unsolicited junk that one CANNOT unsubscribe from.

          "Contenu": "So I\u2019m editing this reply to answer Mr. Posners reply. Mr. Posner. You are incorrect. First of all, the file created on my case DOES say that the drive is defective. I happen to know this because somebody read me the file. Also, one of your sales associates, whom I spoke to at length, told me that this was the wrong drive for me all together, and that the same thing was likely to happen again that is\u2026 It was likely to work for a few days and then stop working. I did not save the packaging because it was working fine for five days , I also did my homework and looked up what  is the best drive to save photos on and this particular drive was mentioned. However, the sales associate said he has heard many times about this kind of thing happening when you are trying to download a large file set, and he told me that in fact, I really should be able to exchange for the proper drive, which he told me the name of. He wrote a special note into my  complaint, describing the issue and recommending that I\u2019d be allowed to exchange for the correct drive. When I asked him if there was something I should have noticed about the description that would have alerted me that this was not appropriate for me, he said no there is nothing in the description that would\u2019ve alerted you it just isn\u2019t the right drive. He recommended two other options. Bottom line is I was willing to buy a more expensive drive if I could exchange this wrong one,  but your customer service refused me three times saying my only option was an even exchange for yet another WRONG DRIVE. As far as I am concerned, your customer service was terrible. I bought a recommended hard drive for a recommended use. It failed after five days. Your service person told me I should really have a different drive altogether, because this was likely to happen again . And now I am stuck with a drive that will never work for me even though I only bought it less than a week ago. Beyond that, I was willing to do an exchange for a much more expensive item as long as it would work for me.  I do not understand why the description of this drive makes me think it will work for me, and then your sales associate tells me it won\u2019t. It fails, and you refuse to even exchange for something that will. I did not keep the packaging because it\u2019s a hard drive, and it was working fine for five days. I do not understand why your management team cannot make this right for me. I am stuck with a hard drive I can never use.I am happy to go into detail and prove every point I have made if you care to discuss it further. As a former investigative reporter for the program \u201c60 Minutes\u201d I am totally aware of what is right and what is wrong in consumer matters and what your team and B&H Photo did was WRONG. Now I am going to be stuck with hundreds of dollars of (to me) useless gear.  339-970-1202 I bought a 12T hard drive formatted for my Apple computer ... then after one week siting on my desk downloading 10T of photos from the cloud, it failed to mount. I had thrown away the packaging as it never occurred to me after it worked fine initially that it would BREAK in a week. Now all they are willing to do is send the THE SAME THING. This is despite the fact that their own sales person said the product is WRONG for my uses and will break again!  I want to exchange for the right product or get a refund. The customer service was APPALLING."

          "Contenu": "For years, B&H Photo has been a trusted name in the photography and videography world, but their recent partnership with Comenity Capital Bank has raised serious concerns about their commitment to customers' well-being.Questionable Partnerships: B&H's decision to partner with Comenity Capital Bank for the Payboo Card has exposed their loyal customers to questionable financial practices. This bank's history of what many, including myself, deem predatory behavior is widely documented. Such an association is surprising and deeply disappointing from a brand that holds such a reputable position in the market.Shared Responsibility: By choosing to do business with a bank with a contentious reputation, B&H Photo is indirectly subjecting its patrons to potentially deceptive and harmful financial practices. While B&H might argue that the responsibility lies with Comenity, it's essential to acknowledge that B&H's endorsement of the Payboo Card makes them complicit. They cannot turn a blind eye to the experiences their customers face due to this partnership.Reputation at Stake: B&H's association with Comenity Capital Bank has already begun to tarnish their otherwise stellar reputation. It's a classic case of a company's actions speaking louder than their words. B&H Photo needs to seriously reconsider this partnership if they wish to maintain the trust and loyalty of their vast customer base.In conclusion, while B&H Photo has always been a reliable source for high-quality photography and videography equipment, their business decisions, particularly their association with Comenity Capital Bank, have cast a shadow of doubt. I urge potential customers to be cautious and make informed decisions when considering financial products associated with B&H. And to B&H Photo - your customers deserve better.====Let me take a moment to respond to you, I appreciate Brian's effort to improve the customer satisfaction, but the case is far from over. was B&H liable for its partner's fault? Yes and No, you can say that's what Comenity Capital Bank's problem, that's right, but it is B&H's choice, I would not even know who is Comenity if it were not because I was doing business with B&H, bird of a feather flock together, that's how perception work, in today's business environment, perception is just reality. So you got to be very careful in choosing who you partner with. Again, I would urge B&H sever the business relationship with Comenity, if you read the reviews of this bank, it is not hard to conclude, theft is a habit. what else you are waiting for?"

Items delivered Jan. 5, but B&H, instead of using my correct address, sent them to an address I have not been at in over 7 years. My options are to wait for wait for the items to be returned to B&H, have the return processed by B&H, then, either refund my credit card, or have B&H reship them. Who know how long the packages  will take to be returned, and am I going to be held responsible for he return when I never received the items? I went ahead and reordered the items, and told B&H to keep the returned items. A big pain in the ass. Glad I did not need the items when I should have received them."

They could have contacted FedEx, but instead said it was their policy not to do that. I contacted FedEx and tried to have them route the package to a holding facility, but they delivered it anyway...and some stranger signed for it.As a result, I'm most likely out $1000+ dollars. While this was in part my fault, I would expect a company that cares about their customers to actually offer some sort of assistance when mistakes happen. At the very least, they could have contacted FedEx about the delivery and told them to send it back.I'm still giving them three stars because they have been my go-to camera company for the last five years. I recommended them to everyone. That being said, I never had a problem with an order. I figured customer service would take care of me if I ever had a problem. I moved to a location out in the country recently and am afraid to order anything else from them on the chance there will be a problem with the delivery."

I purchased over $5k worth of items and realized I did not purchase an extended warranty. I contacted the company via online chat and when they recommended I contact Allstate to ask about their coverage they gave me 2 wrong numbers. I\u2019m not dinging them for that. What I am most upset about is when I called to talk to them they did give me the correct number. After I did more research on my own I realized I did have another option\u2026a much BETTER option for warranty called Canon CarePAK Plus. It is $80 more then what it cost through Allstate but HELLO I want my equipment serviced by CANON so why wouldn\u2019t I want that? It bothers me that I only stumbled across this option on accident while researching reviews for Allstate (which were all over the place). Canon CarePak reviews were 4.9 stars. This should be offered FIRST to all B&H customers upfront. I am disappointed they don\u2019t promote it. This will NOT keep me from shopping from B&H. They have always been my go to photo store. I just hope this helps other customers when it comes to choosing a warranty."

Also, my experiences with FedEx shipping have been consistently bad for years, with damaged items (requiring returns to B&H), poor communication, and late deliveries. As a major customer, B&H should lean on FedEx to provide MUCH better service."

          "Contenu": "UPD 10.27.23. Refund received, problem resolved. In this regard, I am changing the rating in the review, but I would like to note that questions for the support service still remain. In particular, what saddened me most about this experience was that I did not receive answers to all the questions and had to constantly ask again. But in any case, thank you for resolving the issue.On October 11, 2023, I placed an order in the amount of $5161.85. After paying by credit card, I received a message that the verification department could not confirm this payment, for some mystical reasons (the card was in my name, they were provided with all the necessary data). I was asked to pay for the order via wire transfer, which I did. The order was confirmed and sent, BUT the payment that was made from the credit card was never refunded. After this, a long conversation with technical support began, which is more like a conversation between a deaf person and a dumb person. It makes absolutely no sense to ask more than one question in a letter, they will answer at best one question, the rest will be ignored. I asked to provide me with documents confirming the refund, to which the support employee replied that my bank was allegedly rejecting the refund. They cannot provide any documents that confirm the fact of rejection. Technical support claims that there were several attempts to make a refund, but my bank allegedly rejected them. To the question - how can I get a refund in another way, I did not receive an answer. The support person keeps telling me that my bank is rejecting the refund. After much correspondence, I was told that I needed to request a \u201ccharge back\u201d from my bank, but my Indonesian bank CANNOT initiate this process without confirmation from the merchant. Once again I'm waiting for a response from support. Yesterday I wrote to them that my bank requested confirmation for the return and the support employee replied that the order was delivered! They are even too lazy to read the history of the dialogue before answering. I don't understand why I have to spend so much of my time solving this issue and how it is possible to solve customer problems so poorly. It's a terrible, disgusting experience. Absolute ignorance of the problem that arose"
