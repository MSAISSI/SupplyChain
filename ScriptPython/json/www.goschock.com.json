You just took away my copy machine, if you didn\u2019t have a receipt for me we could have made a copy BEFORE you removed the machine."

          "Contenu": "Schock Logistics was to pickup and deliver a copier from one of our buildings. I made arrangements and had added in the notes to give a 24 hour advance call to coordinate having staff available to open the door for them. Driver called when they were at the building, and stated that they would just come back the next week as they are only in the area once a week. I let the driver know that the next week wasn't an option as we were moving buildings and needed to have all equipment out. I called the Schock representative who stated that it would be an additional $123.00 charge to pick it up the next day between 9:00 am- 3:00 pm. reluctantly I paid the additional pickup fee and arranged to be available between the times they listed for pickup. I called representative at 2:30 pm and asked for an update as it was getting close to the expected pickup time. Representative called the contacting company truck driver (two different companies involved) and they told me they wouldn't be there until 5:00 PM. At 4:30 the truck driver calls and states that it will not be until after 6:00 pm. I called the dispatcher directly and they were able to get another truck to come and pick up the equipment. I spoke to a Schock supervisor and he stated that he would correct the problems and follow-up with me the following morning, which he did not. Schock was very unhelpful at scheduling (I had to go straight to the dispatcher of the contracting company) and making the pickup correctly. Will not be using this company in the future."

Then on Thursday, March 28, 2019, there was a delivery company on my door step expecting to pick up the old copier.  I was not aware of this at all.  Not impressed that the pick up was just scheduled without any conversation with me.  Extremely lucky that I was not in a scheduled meeting.  I definitely had to scramble to get the paperwork together that was required to be sent with the copier.  The driver was understanding and was able to wait a little extra time to allow me to get everything together. ."

I received this email to review the company prior to them even scheduling the pickup. Upon calling the company to see what was going on I was put on hold for 10 minutes and then told they would have to call me back. I asked why we had not received a call to even schedule the pickup when I was given the time-frame for which it should be picked up and now that time frame has 24 hours - the gentleman on the phone seemed very annoyed I would even ask this question and responded with \"who would give you a time-frame?\" and \"when were you given this supposed time-frame?\" then told me he would have to call me back when he had more information. Highly disappointed in the customer service from this company and the follow through."

Amable was even so kind as to contact me immediately when I made the mistake of removing the hard drive from our copier, which I very much appreciated! And because she called me promptly, I was able to recall our copier service technician to return to reinstall it, preventing expensive fees at the destination. I give Kevin and Amable and Spencer Schock 5 stars.The contracted freight carrier, however, could improve. We paid the invoice and returned the waiver by the morning of June 20. The driver called once on June 21, but since then their communication has been poor to nonexistent. There have been two failed pickups so far with no communication from the carrier. The first time the explanation was a major freeway crash, but there was no call informing of this delay. For yesterday's failed pickup there was neither a call nor an explanation. Today I have been expecting another pickup, but it appears likely that it will not happen within the next 45 minutes as I write this. Delays are understandable, but prompt communication regarding the delays would be welcomed.I have been communicating with Amable to try to get this pickup completed, and my attitude at this point is, \"I'll believe it when I see it.\" Spencer Schock has offered to cover the imminent penalty fees for a late return, which is much appreciated. It would just be so nice if the carrier were reliable and communicative. I give three stars only because of this poorly behaved contractor."

After she received the email, she forwarded it on and I was promptly called in order to get more information about the issues that I had. Schock clearly cares about their customers, but it's their third parties that do not. \r My initial complaint is as follows: \r\"I'm not generally one to complain about how processes are handled, but I have to say that I was hoping that this shipping and de-installation would go much smoother than it did. \r Though the process has been timely, I have been completely cut out of the communication loop. I had a Toshiba representative show up completely unannounced on Friday to take out our hard drive. Luckily, our new printer was coming the same day, but if this had been the case, we would have been totally out of luck all of Friday and possibly Monday. I was originally told that the printer was to be taken apart on Tuesday or Wednesday. \r Today, I was supposed to receive a call 30 prior to the pick-up of the Toshiba. I either did not receive a call or at least was left no message at all, and he came during the one time of day I had told the shipping representative that we would be at lunch. One of my managing partners had to receive him with no prior knowledge of the transaction, he was just signing in hopes that someone wasn't stealing our old printer. \r Basically, everything that has happened has happened by surprised and not according to plan.\""

We were liable for the condition of the machine until it got to the end delivery point. I was concerned that the copier was simply rolled down the outside walk on the plastic wheels on the copier cabinet. The wheels are not that strong and if they had broken and the machine collapsed, it would have done serious damage before it ever got to the truck.The machine was not shrink wrapped until right before they loaded it on the truck. I would have been pleased more if the machine had been loaded, shrink wrapped and strapped on a flat dolly to transport it to the truck.\rI did not stay at the truck long enough to see that it was actually blanket wrapped it before being strapped in for travel. It would have been better for all this to happen before I signed the released and right before they left the property. \rYes, we did take out liability Insurance but I would have preferred more care had been taken to protect my investment in the event there was something damaged that the Insurance would not cover."

The only part I find ridiculous is paying extra to set a specific time/date on when to settle the pick-up, but in the end, Schock was able to handle the moving operation and made it easier overall. Thankfully they were one of the only companies to have valid insurance (Certificate of Liability) so I guess that's another reason I'm not disappointed in their service. To be honest, I would give them a 4.5-star review due to the high cost but at this point, it doesn't matter since they got the job done real quick. Big shout out to Amable for the great help!"

On day of delivery I asked if I could change delivery address.  I went from office to hone and they did the change the day of delivery, no charge!   I was hoping the printer arrived safely with no damage.  Not only did it show up safely, the printer was wrapped up like a bubble  and it was strapped right to the walls nice and tight.  I was impressed. Lastly, the delivery driver was good guy and did everything for me.During delivery and pickup I received emails on the process and where it was on its journey.  A nice touch. I usually NEVER write reviews but this one was a no brainer.  Don\u2019t think twice about going with Schock. I choose them and can HIGHLY RECOMMEND them.   Vinnie"
