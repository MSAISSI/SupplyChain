          "Contenu": "Session ID: a50cf32d-9a9b-11ee-addc-3ca82a232fcaDear Online Notary Center,I recently received my bill for $150 and noticed a charge of $50 for a seal on a blank page. I want to clarify that during the session, I was not informed about this additional cost. I only needed the page where our signatures are signed, and I find it unreasonable to pay for a page I don't need or accept.I kindly request that you review my email and rectify the situation by adjusting the bill accordingly. It is important for the notary to clearly explain any extra charges before proceeding with the service.Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and resolution."

The notary never told me there would be extra fees when fixing my problem. It lined her pockets, though so why disclose."
