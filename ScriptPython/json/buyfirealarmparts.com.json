They are at the top of my list, should I ever have the need again to fix anything related to our fire alarm at church and school. The process was pretty easy, we had our company in San Diego remove the memory board on Monday. We overnight shipped it by Fed Ex (not cheap $125), they fixed the part and return shipped it to us for $115 overnight. The cost was so much more reasonable than having to replace the entire system."
