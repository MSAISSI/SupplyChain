          "Titre": "Do not give these people your money",
          "Contenu": "I booked a 10 day hire through Wisecars (paying in advance) but when I arrived to collect the vehicle I was told I should return in two hours. When I did so, the rental company told me they were still waiting on the vehicle. So I waited in their lobby for another 90 minutes. After waiting 3.5hours in total for them to produce the vehicle they said they could not do so and could not tell me when they would have a vehicle for me. I called Wisecars support and they explained that they would refund me but needed to hear from rental company. I then put the rental company on the phone with the Wisecars support person and the rental company confirmed that they did not have the car available. The rental company representative explained that he could not send that information by email and the Wisecars support person said that the audio recording that Wisecars makes of all its calls was sufficient evidence that the car was not available. I was told that the Wisecars audio recording would be played to the Wisecars manager and that I would receive my refund in 6 working days. After 12 working days I got in touch with Wisecars to ask when the refund would be processed and support got back to me within 30min with this;Thank you for contacting our Customer Support Team.We have reached out to Ace and they sent us this message:Hello Partner,We had a vehicle available for the customer.We have no notes showing the customer arrived to rent.Thank you,If you have evidence that suggests our partner failed to follow our guidelines, please submit it in a response to this message, so we may investigate and act accordingly.Unfortunately, your request for a refund has been denied.I have provided evidence of my arrival at the rental company and departure from the rental company, as well as explained that Wisecars had already told me they had evidence. Wisecars support has been silent ever since. Gonna have to dispute this with the credit card company. This experience ruined my Thanksgiving and continues to create unnecessary stress. Do not make the mistake I made."

They had our flight number and access to our arrival time, we waited almost an hour for the shuttle and no one came. We then Had to rush over to Hertz and pay double for a rental car.

          "Contenu": "We had a disappointing experience due to Budget closing their office earlier than advertised, resulting in us not receiving our rental car. The process of obtaining a refund through Wisecar was extremely frustrating. Wisecar seldom provided updates and consistently claimed that they were awaiting a response from Budget. After several weeks of this back-and-forth, and only upon initiating a claim with my credit card company, did Wisecar finally process our refund. Throughout this ordeal, Budget confirmed that they had already issued a refund to Wisecar. This situation has significantly eroded our trust in Wisecar, and we would hesitate to use their services again due to the lack of transparency and responsiveness. Update per 12/18/23: I wanted to add that Wisecar contacted me to apologize for my experience and asked me to remove my review which I find a dubious practice. This review accurately reflects my experience."

My next step is to contact my state Attorney Generals office to file a complaint for violating fair trade laws. Also thinking of starting a class action lawsuit, Wisecars is making a fortune holding funds and not delivering."

I've never had trouble renting from a company with a debit card before, even internationally, and don't even own a credit card. Never mind that I had already paid the majority of the rental fee and only owed a small amount or that the no debit card policy was not included in the confirmation email. Or the fact that their policy is buried in the terms and conditions and not obvious on their website. They do NOT care. I will NEVER rent from them again."

If you haven't paid for the cancellation insurance, they will keep all your rental and you will end up paying twice.

They have sent vague responses not accepting responsibility for your actions. I have also flagged that Wisecars practices are unlawful under U.K. consumer protection regulations - and sent the government guidelines that demonstrate you are in breach.

When we got back to the Maui Airport(OGG) we had filled up the car 5 minutes earlier.  It was approx. a 1/2 mi away.  When I got out of the car the gal had written something on the side window.  I asked what that was and she replied it was regarding something with safety.  Maybe it did or did not I don't know, but ours had some letter then -X.  I noticed another car but it just had the x.  I asked about the bill and she said that we owed $12.05.  I asked what that was about and she said that she didn't know and that we would have to go to the front desk.  I thought that was odd and did not have time to stand in line so I waited for the email. When I got it IT SAID FUEL CHARGE!!!  When you call Thrifty and finally get through they actually have in their queue to push a number if you had a fuel charge that you don't think you should.  When you push that they tell you that you have to send them the receipt to PROVE time and where you filled up.  Mind you we were charged before they EVER EVEN TOUCHED the car.  When I called I told them it seemed like standard practice to charge people.  They did finally refund our money on that.  We also had to replace the battery in the remote so that we did not get stranded.  We called Thrifty and they said that if we would replace it rather than having them drive and hour to meet us that they would refund us.  They did not.  The car was also not clean and the roof fabric looked like someone had exploded a pop by it.  I will never rent through Thrifty again."

Bottom line is that I was misled and the cheap prices quoted on this website do not feature the real costs.

This happened to me in December 2022.  It is then impossible to get a response from them which is personalised.    It is pretty much theft as they do not need to pay the car rental company and they keep your money.

I was drawn in by the too-good-to-be-true pricing and happily paid for a reservation with Fox rent a car through the wisecars site. I intended to use a visa debit with line of credit at pickup since it said credit only and those are typically accepted as such.Fox was awful\u2026I tried to call them 3 times before they closed as my flight was arriving near the time they shut down at 12:30am. They never bothered to answer and nobody was at the desk when I arrived just moments late. I patiently waited until they were to open at 4am and nobody showed up. About 15 minutes later I called wisecars who were unable to help or contact anyone from Fox including the location manager. Eventually at 4:25 I finally found an agent wandering the parking garage and attempted to retrieve my reservation. The agent was impatient and rudely threw the debit card back at me without even asking if it had line of credit and unkindly told me they were unable to help. I was now stuck in Phoenix with no way around and a large part of my funds tied up. All in I was up for 40 hours dealing with this thanks to uncaring companies who view people only as numbers.I contacted wisecars and told them of the situation. They contacted Fox who lied about my calls and claims. I showed wisecars photo evidence to back up my claims. They were unwilling to offer reasonable satisfaction and hid behind a dubious justification in their terms that only worked if they ignored my claims about how Fox handled the situation. They ignored my evidence and needs and stole from a struggling family by hiding behind \"procedure\" rather than having true consideration for a situation.DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE! AT THE VERY LEAST GO DIRECT AND SHOW THEM A SCREENSHOT OF WISECARS PRICE\u2026THEY WILL MOST LIKELY MEET OR EVEN BEAT IT TO KEEP THE MONEY THAT WOULD OTHERWISE GO TO WISECARS IN FEES."

I had to pay again and it cost me significantly more than what I had already paid. I am very annoyed that they can\u2019t seem to sort out something that should have been straight forward. I feel I\u2019ve been left stranded. I would love to even get an update from Wisecars. I intend to write to as many papers, travel journals as possible to tell them of the nightmare experience I\u2019ve had with Wise Cars"

They tell me that all they can do is cancel the reservation and they charge 500$ for the can cancellation! Do not go with this company, the customer service has no toll-free number and they literally do nothing and then they can charge you a big $ for cancellation."

The car rental guy snidely told me I probably shouldn\u2019t trust third party vendors because they don\u2019t tell you all the rules. He said he marked my reservation as denied and to get with Wisecars for a refund. I then proceeded to another company in the airport and paid double to continue with my planned trip. I contacted Wisecars and they told me there were no refunds and it\u2019s clearly stated on their contract, but they would make an \u201cexception\u201d for me and refund 75% instead of the full amount because they still had expenses to cover in \u201cprocessing\u201d my reservation and refund. I rebutted this decision but they again shot me down in flames. This was a very frustrating and disappointing experience with Un-Wisecars. I don\u2019t want this happening to anyone else. Bottom line: go with a reputable first line company that doesn\u2019t expect payment until you actually pick up the vehicle, and DO NOT deal with third party, bottom feeding, sweatshop boiler rooms.

Customer service rep at the counter asked how I\u2019m going to insure the car. I told her I\u2019m not going to as my car insurance covers rentals and I also paid for reservation to Wisecars with AmEx, which covers rental car up to $85000. The rep kept repeating they don\u2019t accept AmEx and don\u2019t honour Canadian insurance policies. After calling Wisecars customer support I spoke with Vilol, who told me that even I decide not to take a car at Hub Rent-a-Car I will still be charged for full reservation as \u201cit is active already\u201d in their system. So I ended up paying $485 USD insurance charge even though I had valid insurance from 2 sources. This tripled the cost of the car rental. So this is trap to money from you. Do not follow this trap, avoid them, this is not legitimate business, Wisecars do not have own fleet of cars, only operate with \u201csuppliers\u201d who will try to extract more money from you."

I called Wisecars who pointed out it was in the small print of the voucher which they send me after the cancellation period - I only got it after chasing them -  just 24 hours before I flew - I did not get it 48 hours in advance as promised - so could not do anything about it. I felt this was a real con  and they just weren't interested in helping. To be fair to Fox who were the rental company, they were really apologetic, but it was Wisecars that really caused the issue in the first place.I won't use this company again and am telling everyone I know to avoid them."

We had the vehicle for 18 days so this would have cost over $300 and we never went through one toll. They tried to scaremonger the whole group into purchasing this which we all rejected and got told we would regret it however clearly not true and just tried to get more money out of us. The rental wasn\u2019t cheap and everyone raves about American customer service however it was really poor. Wouldn\u2019t recommend and will not use again in the future as they cannot be trusted."

So I was told they couldn't give me a refund and I could not rent the car because the pick up date passed which was less than 24 hour period.I sent emails and I called them. it's not cool. I was going to a graduation. Now I no longer have the funds to rent another car. I'm not able to attend graduation.  This sucks"

Wiscars charged me over $200 and told me I would owe another $127.83 at the Austin airport. When I got to Thrifty, their reservation said I would return the car to San Antonio, which I'm glad I caught and corrected. I was not charged by Thrifty when I picked up the car at the airport, but when I returned it I was charged $264.25, an overcharge of $136.42 by Thrifty. As soon as I noticed the overcharge I reported it to Wisecars. Their customer support is hard to access, they mostly want to run it through email and chat. Now 6 weeks later Wisecars says they are still waiting on Thrifty to respond. Wisecars refuses to refund me money and says they only have 1 person for their \"special process\" of requesting the long  line of refunds from Thrifty. I've already waited 6 weeks. No indication of if/when I'll get a refund. No communication unless I initiate it. Don't believe Wisecars' price if they won't stand behind it."

          "Contenu": "I had booked cars through Wisecars before and my experiences had been good. Not outstanding, but good. I must say that their pre-sales customer service reps gave me excellent service.This time, though, I booked a car with Centauro Rent a car out of Valencia's airport through Wisecars. I chose to book an \"additional driver\" for which, according to all the information Wisecars gave me throughout the booking process and up to the pick-up moment, was that the cost for it was 7 Euro.Come pick-up time at Centauro's desk the cost was 19 Euro. They wouldn't yield to my reasoning and the documents Wisecar had sent to me, stating that the was 7 Euro; so it was a take it or leave it situation. For all Centauro showed me on their system, their standard rate for an additional driver has always been 19 Euro. So I completed the rental; paid the additional 12 Euro and sent my complaint and request for a 12 Euro refund directly to Wisecars.After many weeks and acknowledgments on their side that I had a pending request with them, without any other answer, I have decided to write this report. If I lost 12 Euro, let it be to alert other customers about this unfair business practice.PS. Less than 24 hours from the time I posted the text above, Wisecars replied through Trustpilot and directly to me, stating that they would refund the 12 Euro I was claiming. They did so and I appreciate their promptness this time."

When I phoned the original vendor, I was informed that all they can do is cancel my reservation and book a new vehicle at twice the price!

The rote excuses, and being put through the wringer, should never have happened.  ORIGINAL:  They'll take your money but no car if you don't read the fine print.  Wife left stranded at LAX with Fox Rent-a-Car when she didn't have an \"International Drivers Permit\". She has a USA passport, UK driving license and proper credit card. We've rented >75 times over >25 years. We've never been asked for - let alone heard of - an \"International Driving Permit\". Never, not once. The IDP translates local driving licenses into multiple languages such as English.  Her UK driving license was already in English.  She was rejected and Wisecars and Fox kept all the money. Fox has no availability, so presumably has already rented the car and been paid twice. None of the above fits with the biggest words on Wisecars' website:  \"TRUSTED\" and \"BEST PRACTICES\". Fox at LAX also doesn't fit with Wisecars' other big slogan: \"a wide selection of internationally known brands\". Wisecars didn't even try to live up to its credo: \"We are committed to providing an exceptional customer experience as well as outstanding care and support, and we enjoy helping you to get the best out of your holiday.\"  A rote apology was offered."

Both of these other companies have TERRIBLE ratings and reviews in Trust Pilot.The booking included our flight information (Airline and flight number) so the rental company were able to track the arrival time in case of any issues.We had a meet and greet service booked and after boarding our flight we learned that the flight would be delayed by 2 hours. We made contact with WiseCars (who we had our booking with), and they in turn confirmed they had emailed SurPrice to inform them of the delay. However when we arrived there was nobody there to meet us. We called the local number given to us for \"SurPrice\". The representative said we were a \"no show\" despite us giving notice of the delayed flight and having given the flight details. He hung up part way through the call, and I had to call back to check they would still be coming for us.They collected us and drove us to a remote location and then said that as we were a \"no show\" they had cancelled our booking and if we wanted the exact same car it would now cost double as a late booking (Over 400 Euros). We explained that we were not a \"No Show\" and even showed them the emails giving notice of the flight delay, and the return confirmation from Wise Cars confirming they had informed the local car rental company in advance. They were not interested and just kept demanding my passport and credit card which I refused to hand over.This I feel is a deliberate scam from the local company to get people who's flights are delayed to a remote location and then extort money by cancelling the booking and demanding double the price when people are stranded and have nowhere to go.I tried to contact Wise Cars but was unable to make international calls and the email / webchat responses took so long to come back that we could not get any support from wise Cars in time to resolve the issue at the pickup desk.Luckily we had Turkish SIM cards and were able to arrange pick up from a different company at our original booking price. Wise Cars have now refunded the prepayment (after I reaffirmed that we had made proper notification of the delayed flight) which I do give them credit for (which is why I have given 3 stars and not less).I recommended WiseCars cease contracting to Right Cars or SurPrice in future.I would recommend any future customers check with WiseCars who they will subcontract to when making their booking and if it is SurPrice or right Cars then just don't book."

I was told it would only be $20.  And I was told I had to wait over 3 hours to pick up the car.  That did not go over well with me.Wisecar has since contacted me and is refunding the $86 extra Avis made me pay.  So I would like to thank them for that.Wisecars needs staff who will answer the phone when you need assistance.  I called twice and waited on line for more than 15 minutes, only to be disconnected.  That is not good service.  Therefore, I am only giving them 3 stars."

Other than that the communication with Wisecars is simple and accessible, and the insurance seems to be cheaper than others (I have not filed a claim, I'm only speaking about the price)."

The reason I'm not giving a 5 star review is that I booked a vehicle for pickup at 12am on 10/27/21 and the date and time changed to 12pm at 10/26/21 after I submitted it. I sent an email to support, as per the instructions, and received an email back from Hannah saying that I would have to pay an additional $258 to change my booking due to the time of pickup even though I'd have it for less time. I think Wisecars does care about service and tries working with customers, but this isn't a reasonable solution. I am now waiting to see if I can change the pickup for 12pm on 10/27/21 without losing the rental or increasing the cost. I will cancel the rental and go with another company if I can't."

It was only after arguing for 10 minutes with the guy that he backed down and decided not to charge me for something I hadn't done. It has put me off dealing with National again, but I know Wisecars are just a broker and the whole process with them has been fine so would use them again in the future."

The price of a used car! That's because the insurance we bought through Wisecar wasn't \"comprehensive enough\". So we had a choice of either buying another insurance -from the rental provider-, pay a GBP2,500 deposit, or forfeit our rental (after the whole ordeal just to get there). Overall, not a good experience."

I had some trouble to fix it and it took me a week and another drive to the rental station, but finally it was fixed. Wisecars was very gentle handling  the problem and after coming home they gave me the money for my insurance problem back. Good job finally. I can recommend wisecars!!!Stefan Kronenberg, GER"

          "Contenu": "I don't normally write reviews but considering the number of critical reviews I have seen and the outstanding service I received from my WiseCars experience, I feel obligated to share.This is a smaller company so I feel expectations should be measured. If you normally have issues with rental car companies because of age, debit card or some other issue then you are probably better off going to one of the bigger sites like expedia.  However, if you are cost conscious and are in one of the more challenging rental car markets (like New York) then I highly endorse this company. I had a technical issue with my rental and I was able to get someone on the phone to resolve it. The customer service rep at WiseCars even requested that I stay on the line with them as I went to the rental desk to make sure everything would go smoothly. It did go smooth and I didn't need their help but don't expect companies like Expedia to go the extra mile for you like this company did."
