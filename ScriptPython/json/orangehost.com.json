          "Contenu": "I have worked with many of these hosting companies in many years.  I just encountered this OrangeHost very recently and I will give you my 5 cent worth review on them.First of all, it is cheap.  Price isn't everything when you are looking to host a website, but for many non-essential bloggers and casual web user probably that is the main issue with many of these types of providers.Fine, with that being said, the cheap comes with shortcomings.  Yup shortcomings.  If you are looking for business use hosting, OrangeHost is not definitely one of choices you would want to get.The major problem is their server and line speed is what you get for your money level SLOOOOOW.If you have only a page or two WordPress blog, probably it is ok, but not for business use for sure.There are tons of other low-priced webhosting services around, there are many faster than OrangeHost.  You should look elsewhere for better suitable hosts.Also, being an economical provider they have tons of IP that has been in the black lists.  That will be a headache for business user as your emails will not reach or your customers and clients will receive messages that the destination is marked as spammers.  That will be a huge problem.  Just as any other provider, they will not do anything about your IP address past history.  You are your own to deal with many of the spam blacklist entities individually.  Oh, on top of that is that you will not get new IP in exchange nor refund with them.  So good luck.For the final comment, they only refund month-to-month payment type.  So if you took up one-year sign-up to get more discount you are stuck with them for entire duration.  (By the way, most other providers will refunds you for longer sign-up account not on month-to-month)"

It makes it difficult to learn how a \"process\" can be executed. I suggested that the existing good bank of videos OrangeHost has prepared be extended to cover processes that non-technical users like myself can benefit from. For example, the use of folders and redirection, the use of SSL, setting up email accounts on various clients (eg OUTLOOK), etc. That would be helpful.Thanks"
