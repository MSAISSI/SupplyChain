          "Contenu": "While the server is fine for simple worlds do not try to run anything technical on a melon cube server. MSPT will shoot up with hardly any entities loaded, and even increases for few tile entities. I had to disable spawnchunks to keep MSPT <50 (and TPS at 20), which was annoying and felt cheaty. Also really annoying that no performance tools available in the console. A CPU and RAM monitor would be nice to have, as I had to rely on in-game tools."

Lag teleports also happening to my friend and I. Asked for a refund on the 6th day and was denied. Cancelled my recurring charge and moved on. Either host your own server or use someone different. People work hard for their money and this company does not respect that sadly. This has not been my only negative encounter with meloncube. I would suggest either hosting your own server if you current computer can handle that or researching some other companies first to save your money, time and hassle. This is a totally unbiased, non-emotional review I decided to fill out after they emailed it to me a few days after I shut my server down I had for less than a week due to lag. Everyone can learn for themselves but I hope this helps someone out there."

          "Contenu": "Hey, I'm FlameHero.Currently the official founder, owner, and director of the MCWarriors Factions Servers.First of all, their servers claim to run on some pretty advanced tech machines, I mean their CPUs are like the best in town, or so as they claim. I haven't noticed any improvements since I switched and in fact I've even had more issues than benefits from switching, low TPS (/timings report said 'Server Performance' and I have 6GB) and a bunch of other issues, boats used to work, now they don't.Second of all, unlike my previous host I was forced to NOT use paperspigot as it was 'crypto mining', I was resetting my server and I HAD to install in a few unstable plugins, yet they couldn't handle it so they first suspended it, then later on terminated it.PS: My server depends on PaperSpigot and some pretty large plugins. I never had issues with the previous host although I was using the SAME version of paper, if you guys don't know the issue don't just go ahead and make theories.Last but not least, one of the most like, I don't even know how to describe it, it's like those staff members you really hate, the ones that claim to know it all when they have no knowledge how to run a server whatsoever.Thanks.EDIT: As a reply to your 'Why my server was terminated', keep in mind that I stated that my server cannot run without Paper, and if I was given less than 36hours I would've completely revamped the server and upgraded, things would've gotten well, but instead you guys rushed into the decision which was unprofessional and the fact that you assumed it was some crypto mining service or something, that...that's just unprofessional okay?"

          "Titre": "Worst Minecraft Host customer relations i ever had.",
          "Contenu": "Apparently this is a one-man operation and the host lacks any dedicated customer support staff at all, because if he had, maybe they would treated me far better.   First of all i go to post a pre-sales support ticket on their website , a day later, i check the ticket status, it cant be found.  Frustrated, i find that they have live chat on their website, so i open a chat.  I inform them that their is a problem with their ticket system because i posted a ticket the night before, and got email confirmation from them that it was sent,  only to have it missing today.  He pretty much acts like i must have sent it to the wrong site (which i have proof i did not)Then while talking to him about dedicated server options, he closes out the support chat.  (at the same time sending an email to me stating he closed out the new ticket i made because we were chatting, well funny cant talk more if you close the chat eh?)at this point i am pretty upset, so i email them back and say \"what the hell? you closed out the chat?\"  Turns out he fasley assumes just because i made a few typos and my email has 2005 in it, that means im underage.  First of all i had the same email for 11 years  it was the year i made the email NOT when i was born.it seems to me he and his company is more interested in saving their own behinds then they are about actual customer support.   I also tried to contact the company via facebook hoping, maybe that someone besides HIM managed their facebook page,  Wrong, not only did the chat window show that they were online, it was closed out of (again) and he apparently blocked me on facebook.  Thats ok. i left a negative review, the only review of his service there that hopefully he can not delete.You should hire more support staff. the admin should NOT be the only person who is handling, chat/support, maybe if you had people who knew how to actually do proper PR instead of being overly paranoid to save their own asses.  You might get more customers and therfor able to hire more staff.I never have posted a review here before, but i wanted to personally share my experience , it was appalling. and downright rude.but hey thanks for making my choice so much easierNOT to go with you.[reply to comment below]Sorry but your canned apology does not make up for the horrible way you acted.  actions speak louder then words. the way you acted should have NEVER happend in the first placeif your company was worth its salt. you woudnt have blocked me on facebook either or cowardly removed the review i posted  You turn tail and ran over a misunderstanding rather then deal with it like an adult.Yeah i didnt pay a dime. thats not the point. You woudnt LET me because you falsey assumed i was underage when i am not. and honestly have no reason to prove it to you at this point.  I never had to \"prove that\" to any other company lately But yes you can save face for yourself here by acting like you are the saint and i was the person being unreasonable anyways the review stands. and at least unlike facebook you cant turn around and disable it.and you call ME the child.and ill post their last email\"Can I ask what your aim is here?You haven\u2019t used our services, so we\u2019ve done you no damage. Simply closed your chat window for what we believed was a legitimate reason, and later apologised. Why exactly do you have to go to such great extent to damage our reputation and throw this in our face?Gee here is a thought....maybe if you hadnt acted in the horrible way you did to me in the first place YOU woudnt have damaged your OWN companies reputation.  YOU did that sir. NOT me.you want to talk about being an adult? How about stop blaming others and own up to your own mistakes. thats what being an adult is.  and the mere fact you cant understand that but i can, shows im obviously more adult then you and your company are.also apparently if you post something on youtube they dont agree with they will try to harass you over it too i heard from someone else.my advice to anyone is stay the bloody heck away from this company and spend your hard earned cash elsewhere.yes i didnt pay a dime. so yes maybe i shoudnt be so upset. but its the principal of the matter that is the problem here and THATS what this company fails to understand."

Overall, the server performance isn't great, but they have a great website/GUI (with occasional outages in specific parts), amazing pricing, and extremely fast support.

Sometimes they respond in under 15 minutes, other times I wait 1-5 hours for a response.  Once, I was waiting for 14 hours to be told a large file transfer was finished and I was the one to have to message them for an update.  Estimated time of completion was 6-8 hours.The majority of the techs can be rather passive aggressive at times.  The only one I haven't seen be that way is Andrew B. They really need to work on their customer service skills and professionalism.  Half of the time they don't answer the questions asked or don't answer them in detail.I understand it can be frustrating to deal with a ton of server owners who may not know what they're doing, but, in the end, they are your customers and there's no easier way to run off customers than to be rude to them or make them feel like a nuisance.p.s. \"Disable all plugins and test for the issue\" is not a viable option for most server owners that have an active player base."

While I only had their plan for 1-2 months, I had zero issues with them and their support was quick/helpful!Due to unforeseen circumstances I could no longer afford a dedicated server which is why I cancelled. I accidentally cancelled it prematurely though before I could create a backup of files. I contacted host and they said I'd have 1 day to get files I need off of it, or if I wish I could renew my plan too.While I cannot vouch for their shared hosting plans as I have no experience with them, their dedicated servers & support are 10/10! Would use again.----------------------------UPDATED REVIEW:Just a side note, I gave their normal Minecraft plan a try. Perhaps I just had bad timing, but shortly after buying they had maintenance for 15 minutes. Eh, okay fine. Then I try to get back to work on my server and it has daemon connection issues. As far as I can recall, I've only ever had this issue on hosts that use Multicraft. Very annoying, especially because I actually needed this time to work on my server. Literally purchased a $9 plan so I could work on it for  the next few hours and it couldn't even stay up consistently to do that. And daemon issues also mean you can't connect to server files so you can't even create a backup on your PC & do work there instead.TLDR:- Dedicated servers = perfect (5/5)- Support = amazing (5/5)- Minecraft Plans = greatly lacking, at least in my experience over the last ~3 hours. (2/5)"

I was reimbursed with free server time but I lost more expensive builds and all playerdata.This was a little while ago so hopefully things have changed and I'm not too harsh"

I am not the most organized person and often forget to pay this bill on time as I use it for my test server.  I decided to Add Funds to my account so newly generated invoices would automatically be paid.  (I have done this in the past with no problem.)  This time around my bill was not automatically paid two months in a row, despite it still saying on their site that that's how it works.  Today, I was informed that this is no longer the case and payments need to be posted manually.  Why this is, I have no idea, but it seems silly to remove a helpful feature for both the client and MelonCube.If you want a decent running server with fast support, then go for it, but don't expect miracles.  You won't be able to run a large server with a bunch of plugins here, but it'll get the job done well for smaller servers."

One big plus, however, is the support team at Meloncube is one of the best support teams in the entire world. I opened a ticket once, and they responded within 15 Minutes! 15 MINUTES! That is crazy good support, and every time I've submitted a ticket, no matter what time of day, I always get a response within 30 minutes. It's INSANE, and I don't know how they do it, but it is truly amazing."

          "Contenu": "My experience with meloncube has been incredibly pleasant. My brother bought a server for our discord server to play in, with a modpack made by me, and we've run into almost no issues. We originally bought the 1 year plan for a 1GB RAM server, since it was cheapest and we thought it'd be enough. After officially opening the server, a few people joined for the stress test, and there was a bit of lag, which we thought \"fair enough, we just need to upgrade\". It was our fault, and we knew that. We ended up upgrading to the 4GB subscription, and there has been practically no lag anymore! I really enjoy the quality of the servers. There is virtually no lag at all when playing, even when running several automatic farms at once on different dimensions! Even modded dimensions, in fact! The prices are incredibly fair, maybe even a little cheap at times, and the quality is incredible considering how many customization options you get, especially with automatic modpack installation! Overall, a 10/10 experience, and will keep using this service in the future."

As today, my second one (3Gb) have been running for a couple weeks with even more plugins and everything runs smoothly.Now about the features, the Multicraft 2.0 control panel may look threatening at first, but once you get to know it, it is really easy to use, and gives you the chance to customize almost every aspect of your server: whether you want to just play vanilla or make a Spigot/Paper/Bukkit server with a lot of plugins. If you do not know how to do something, MelonCube does have video tutorials  and a \"Knowledge\" section in the website for basic and advanced stuff, and I guess you can also contact with support by making a ticket if you want.I'm really happy with my experiencie so far, plus they are not as expensive as other \"famous\" hosting services that does not even offer the amount of extras and specs that MelonCube does.Just make sure you select the proper region for your server, and everything will run smoothly."

          "Contenu": "I used MelonCube to host my server for about a year and a half. Having switched from MCProHosting, MelonCube was a much more reasonable alternative, and I'm very glad I made the switch. Overall, my server had way less lag, the customer support was quick to respond and very helpful, and everything ran smoother server-side once I switched to MelonCube. For reference, I ran a Paper server with around 65 plugins and 8GB of RAM, and there was only lag and TPS drops during popular events (when 20-60 people were on the server at once) - while I did try to circumvent this by buying extra RAM during events, that didn't help much. In terms of Minecraft server hosts, I know there are certainly less expensive options out there, but MelonCube is definitely worth the price for its quality and its support."

(My other primary choice is Aquatis but you can check my review for them on my profile). Anyways... I used them for many months on my past servers about 2 years ago. Tickets are answered in a reasonably good amount of time and they are pretty helpful. They'll do whatchu need and are professional about it. Their prices start at 3$ per GB which is pretty good, not the cheapest one but still better than a lot of other host that charge 7$, 8$, or even 9$ per GB. Quality host, reasonable prices, and good/helpful support. Over many months of using their service I never really had a problem with my servers. They ran smoothly without lag or connection issues. One thing I REALLY LOVED was that they can retrieve your old server files even after 12 months. Sounds scary but they keep everything private and secure. Your data is encrypted and protected (at least I'm 99% sure it is). Moreover, I remember shutting down my server for like a year and I came back asking if they still had it and to my surprise they did. They setup my server right where I left off 12 months after I initially shut down my server. I have not used them in like 2 years since I shut down my server but you're essentially paying for great servers and support without spending too much money. You really get the bang for your buck. So yea, MelonCube is a solid choice."

          "Contenu": "I am pleasantly surprised... no pleasantly taken back in shock!  We live in a time where customer support is in the hands of the corporate automation system.  Customer support is most always pretty miserable for the customer.  NOT this company .. no.  I made the change over to this company just due to the list of features and quality this company seemed to have for competitive but a wee bit lower than most competition due to hard times.  typically, when I change hosting services it is just trading one bad experience for another.  The first day I had to contact customer support for something due to an outage somewhere in their area.  They were totally on it... never quit, responded PERSONALLY right away within a very short period.  2 more tickets were placed over time due to things beyond their control... they stuck with it for hours back and forth with me till it was resolved... without question.  Just to show you how far this last call went, the customer support agent (Josh) was helping me with resource pack download that wasn't working, so he told me to try another place to hold / host my resource pack.  it didn't work.. turns out the site was having issues.. Josh didn't just write it off to move on to another customer, he stuck with it, found another one for me, and didn't stop there, he actually uploaded the resource pack I was using to it himself to test it out and responded with the links to the site and the codes to use.  he didn't have to do that.  he didn't have to do any of it according to today's standards.  Every call has been like that with Josh.  3 times, he has taken customer service to elite perfection yet still helped me to be independent with information.  I love this company because of Josh. I know they have other customer service folks but I just haven't gotten them yet."
