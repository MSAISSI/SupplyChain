I had already prepaid SimplyNUC Duties and Taxes, however 1 month later I am still receiving Payment Due Notifications from Fedex for the amount SimplyNUC has apparently not paid.I was also told repeatedly by the SimplyNUC team that they were sorry for the inconvenience they've caused and would like to help make things right. I still haven't received an update on how they're going to do that."

Did not respond to emails for multiple days.  After multiple emails back and forth they said, as if it were a big deal, that they had been \"authorized to give me a full refund\".  What \"full refund\" actually meant was they would after all pay return shipping. Very generous!  By this time, as I had no idea if they were going to reply at all, I had started using the item, so I could not return it.  So they sold me an incorrect item for $100 more than I would have paid elsewhere, and because of their delays, I am stuck with it."

          "Contenu": "I bought the NUC12 Extreme and waited 4 months later to recieve due to chip shortage (I understand that). However, their USB recovery flash drive does not work when I try to restore it.  I called in and asked for a \"PRODUCT KEY\" to activate it and they refused to give out since I already paid for the Win10 Iot Enterpise 2019 High End version.They gave me an answer that they only have one master key to activate them all and I cannot have it. I only have a key product of which been sticker on the bottom of the system. This key only contains 20 digits instead of a normal one as 25. That is how my PRODUCT KEY does not work for Microsoft activation.They promised to send me another restoration USB flash drive within a week. That is what I am concern about. I paid extra money for a good Windows and I have the right to have a correct product key for legal activation.The Window costs me around $220+, I don't complain about the price at all. What make me uncomfortable is the product key is not given out as I am the owner of it Another thing is their graphic card prices are very high sky rocket. I have bought an exact one as their's and it only cost me $420, instead of nearly $1,500 at the time they have offered. I understand they have to make money but not more than 3x times.The NUC12 EXTREME is great, works very good. I love it for my work environment, I am a CAD/CAM programmer by the way.=====Sept.5th.2022 update====NUC refunded the Windows cost of which I paid for and thank you for that."

          "Contenu": "1 Star for dishonest service.I ordered my device (ruby r8) because the website labeled it as \"Now Shipping\" while other devices were labeled \"On Back Order\". I'm actually only in town for a short time. So I ordered the device and paid for rush shipping. The next morning, I get an email that SimplyNUC is very sorry but the lead time is actually 1 week for this device. I guess it's not \"Now Shipping\". So I wait two weeks with no update, and then email them. And now I get a song and dance about how the product wont be shipped until April-June. I'm sorry, that's a hell of a lot different than \"Now Shipping\". And for reference the ASPN50r7 is listed as \"Out of Stock\" and the NUC11TZI7 is listed as \"On Backorder\". This is just completely disingenuous.And do you think I really care for some made up excuse of \"current global chip shortages, severe weather, Chinese New Year, and Covid-19\"? You have severe weather to deal with every year, the Chinese New Year happens every year. The global chip shortage has been happening for two years now. And it doesn't mean you can't ship your products, it means you have less to sell. And Covid 19??? Again, it's been two years, you seriously haven't figured out a safe process yet? I'm sure in that two years, you've got a good sense for how long it takes to ship a device. How ridiculous, all of that constitutes a 2+ month wait on top of the two weeks I already waited for a device that's \"Now Shipping\".Needless to say, I told them to cancel my order and refund my money. Even if I wanted to wait for the device, I couldn't. I'm going to be out of the country in a few weeks. Who knows when I'll be back. That's why I bought a device that said, \"Now Shipping\" instead of one that said, \"Out of Stock\" or \"On Backorder\".Did they cancel the order? Did they refund my money? Did they at least respond to my cancellation and let me know how they plan to fix the situation? No, of course not. But two days later, I start getting automated emails from SimplyNUC's ordering system. I received a FedEX tracking number in one email and a \"Your order is complete\" in another email. Miraculously they had a device to ship to me. So, after 3 weeks I finally get my device. The FedEX shipping was fast. It did take an extra day because of the snow in NYC.I just don't understand the poor service. I wont be doing business with SimplyNUC ever again."

I recently asked their customer service again on the status of my order.  Lo' and behold, I find out from their rep, Matt, that they are purposely putting my order at the back of the line simply because I didn't pay more money for the preinstalled ram and ssd.

When I requested a sample computer, something I was told they do, my request was rejected.  It was rejected because our company has a P.O. box not a physical building.  Our company was started during Covid, we are completely virtual.  So rather than consider things may be changing in the world, they just denied us.  We had to buy and return, no big we did, but it was odd that customer service was so rigid, especially since we have experience with them (we have bought from them previously).  I then requested the life cycle of the computer that we were interested in (the one we bought and returned), I was told we must sign an NDA to get that kind of information.  I find this odd, you can't tell me how long you will be selling a product without my company signing an NDA.Historically I have worked with SimplyNUC, they were always great... something has changed.  Customer service is not what it used to be.  I used to feel like they wanted to work with anyone, this most recent experience it seems like they have grown past that."

Decided to purchase from SimplyNUC ONLY BECAUSE they showed the same original LiteOn power adapter that came with my NUC8i5BEH when I purchased it. The total SimplyNUC cost (with shipping) was $100, and I struggled with paying this much when other, much cheaper, options were available on Amazon. I made the decision to spend the extra dollars ONLY BECAUSE SimplyNUC offered the same LiteOn adapter that came with my NUC. Upon receipt, I found that SimplyNUC sent me the Asian Power Devices DA-90J19 power adapter that I could have bought on Amazon for $21.95 with free shipping (Prime). A follow-up with SimplyNuc customer service resulted only in them saying \"Sorry - the picture of the LiteOn power adapter is only for reference - the one you received will work with your NUC\". I have been satisfied with SimplyNUC purchases previously, but I must say that this looks like a bait and switch tactic. I am very disappointed to have paid FIVE TIMES as much in order to receive the correct (as advertised) LiteOn power adapter, only to receive the inferior quality APD adapter that I had decided against, even though it was only $21.95 on Amazon."

While I still consider their customer service to be top notch, my experience with the product testing in Nov 2018 was not great. The product way under performed and had a number of issues that was shared.. At the time, they didn't believe any of those issues could be resolved quickly.   Also, at the same time, I didn't think it should have been released with what was experienced.   Based on the reply to this review from SimplyNUC, it sounds like those issues have been resolved in the last month.  That's great to here, but not experiencing that myself it's hard to improve the review as it was originally released with the number of issues that it had before.  At this time, I need to keep the review at 2 stars for the great customer service, with the product being at 0 stars due to the number of issues experienced (at the time of testing) and none of them being able to be resolved at the time with the only option by SimplyNuc to return the product for a refund."

Therefore after a week I started to wonder if something was wrong.  So I looked on the web site for a button to click to \"Check Order Status\" or something like that.  There wasn't any.  So the only other option I saw was to log a support ticket, which I did.  I waited for 3 days without a response to the support ticket and figured that must have been the wrong thing to do.  So I just replied to the email SimplyNUC sent confirming my order.  While I was waiting on a response to that, I went to the web site and a chat box popped up asking if I had any questions, so I just asked them about my order and they were very helpful in looking it up and letting me know the normal 7-14 days orders were taking to build.  In the mean time someone answered my support ticket telling me to contact sales.  Also around that time, the sales folks replied to my email.  So, there were at least 3 people involved on the SimplyNUC side not to mention the time I put into finding out that my order was indeed being processed within normal time frames.  All this could have been avoided by simply including a sentence on the order confirmation email about how long to expect the build process to take and how to reach out if there were concerns!"

At some level, I don't mind their policy, but it would have been nice to know that that was the case upfront.  Perhaps a more reasonable compromise is to charge a nominal reservation fee like $100 or $200 instead of the full price of the product.  It makes me worry that I'm funding SimplyNUC's operations and that they could go bankrupt before my order ships.In the beginning, the Customer Service group would send periodic emails on the status of my backorder, which was nice.  But then the tentative ship date passed and there were no status emails of what was going on, which was concerning.  I ended up sending an email to check on status and they responded promptly."

The new NUC is somewhat faster than the ancient Xeon system, which had been upgraded many times.  The reason I am not giving 5 stars is that audio output initially did not work under Ubuntu/Kubuntu, I had to reconfigure the logical linkages in the audio system.  Also, once in a blue moon, the system will boot to a lockup, although I don't remember that happening since my latest BIOS update.  Good system, overall.  BTW, I've been programming anything programmable since about 1970, estimated to be among 500 most intelligent humans ever to exist."

Eventually I did a search and found out there was a well known issue with Intel's latest network chipset and the non-trivial solution involves manual intervention in the Windows installation process, which may not be easy to understand and execute for a common consumer. Maybe a note regarding this in the package would have helped, but then it may scare off some buyers. Anyway, the end-to-end experience was not as smooth as I'd hoped for."

In the long run I think that saved me a lot of trouble.SN was clear in it's communications about availability and shipped the product quickly. I did run into a small but important issue with the product and had to send it back for diagnosis/repair. This took a reasonable amount of time and the product was shipped back. Unfortunately, the power supply was missing and I had to request that be sent back as well, which SN did promptly.I believe If I had purchased through Gamestop and had to deal with thier support for my issue things would not have gone smoothly. The support staff at SN are great, knowledgeable, and helpful."

But then someone at SimplyNuc *was* able to make an instruction requiring a signature for delivery that I had not (and would not have) requested, which predictably resulted in me missing FedEx by about 30 seconds (I saw the delivery person vanishing down the walkway after I didn't mask and answer in time).  I had to drive to the FedEx hub a few hours later to fetch my \"delivery\" if I wanted to work on it over the long weekend instead of waiting, so ding one star for that snafu.Everything else has been good, Nuc arrived in pristine condition and booted into BIOS immediately, was configured exactly as ordered. :+1:"

          "Contenu": "I am a customer of the worst kind, likely.  Ordering a single barebones kit that probably doesn't do much for SimplyNUC's bottom line.  However, instead of complaining about the known supply issues from Intel, I tried to stick with them, as my order was originally placed on 3/10/2021, only to finally ship late 8/6/2021.  I in no way blame SimplyNUC.  I understand that they are not at fault for poor supply and unexpected demand for a niche product.  In fact, if anything, they did update me as expected, telling me when they thought new stock was coming in, updating when the stock did not come as expected, and even provided a free  gift card due to the unreasonable weight.  The staff was always friendly, reasonable, and professional.  LiveChat was also knowledgeable and professional.  Ultimately, when the item did finally come into stock a bit sooner than the last delay suggested, it was shipped overnight for no additional charge.I can't fault SimplyNUC for a supplier issue.  At the same time, since I have many computers and backups/whatever to hold me over, this wasn't a mission critical device.  I can't imagine how out of luck a consumer might be if this was a mission critical upgrade.  So I can't say it was a perfect experience.But SimplyNUC did do what they could, and then some, out of a bad situation.I will likely be ordering the NUC 12 Enthusiast kit from SimplyNUC on release - assuming, of course, that all goes well with the receipt of the Phantom Canyon NUC Enthusiast kit."

After consideration of recommendations from Roon and several outside reviews, I settled on a NUC12WSHi7 to accomplish this with 2.5 GbE LAN, Wi-Fi 6E, and other features for future use.I found that Simply NUC satisfied all my checkboxes while looking at several companies. I have problems with the mobility of my hands, so putting in many of the internals was better left to Simply NUC, who provided  8 GB of memory, 256 GB M.2 SSD, and 1 TB of SATA SSD for a comparable price. The unit was easy to order and arrived within the week. It took 20 minutes to install the Roon OS, and now the NUC has been running on a shelf by itself in the office for a week, managing my music from several sources and providing a bit-stream for my network music player as desired. Occasionally, I log onto the server by its web interface to review the status and look at the log files; however, I have had no problems."

I had to disable both the LED skull and the startup one via the bios, and I think these should be easier to turn off, or more so I think NUC should remove this style of branding all together. It does not make it look more \"tough\" , it kind of comes across as creepy and lame (from my opinion). I believe more people would buy these systems if these were removed."

I assume it must be the computer's security features that have disabled the options to copy and paste or take a screen shot of its system specifications. I'm having problems with a flight simulation program, and Steam's technical staff won't help me unless I can reproduce those specs for them.  I've tried typing them and sending them as an attachment.  No go.  I wish Simply NUC and/or Windows would address this, as other users are having the same problem, and none of the solutions I've read online have worked to solve it.  However, I blame Steam's draconian policy most of all."

So far I couldn\u2019t be more pleased. Easy, no effort, no mess. Nancy, my customer service contact, has been wonderful. Super prompt, quick with responses and follow up. Really a great customer service experience and exactly what I was looking for with a prebuilt. Technology customer support is always hit or miss but I feel very confident given my experience so far. Not one regret. The build itself is also great of course, good component choices and it\u2019s nice to not cross check QVL lists and whatnot to assemble a build. Would do it all over again for sure."

It was easy to contact a sales team member and we worked together to come up with an extremely similar NUC that could be delivered quickly.

          "Contenu": "I'm a Linux developer who has an unhealthy obsession with refresh rates, especially for someone who looks at text all day.I went into this shopping experience looking for a little box for app development that was capable of driving 2x4K@120Hz, with a powerful processor and 64GB of RAM. NUCs quickly showed up as good options, and SimplyNUC was consistently well-reviewed, so I gave them a shot.I thought my specifications would be a big ask, but SimplyNUC's model browser helped me narrow down their offerings and find a NUC12WSKi5 build that I could customize to be absolutely perfect. It was cheap, it was delivered very quickly (despite their lead-time warnings, it took five days from purchase to doorstep) and it was exactly as advertised.SimplyNUC is amazing. Their listings are comprehensive and accurate; their prices are competitive; and their customizable builds with itemized prices are top-notch. Their customer service is great, too -- I missed the first delivery attempt, and SimplyNUC called to let me know before FedEx did.Will find an excuse to buy again."

          "Contenu": "On February 27, 2023 I installed the third NUC I've bought from SimplyNUC. Previously I'd bought 6th & 11th generation systems. This time I got a NUC13RNGi9, Raptor Canyon, i9-13900K, 64GB DDR5, 1TB & 2TB PCIe Gen 4 M.2 SSDs and an additional 92mm fan with Windows 11 Pro.I work with Strategic Account Manager Matt Boone who always provides me with service way beyond what's required or expected. He's a big part of the reason I've continued to purchase from SimplyNUC. Not only does he not upsell, but at times he even suggests less expensive parts. For example, this time he said that he doesn't feel the Gen 4 SSDs perform such that they justify the higher price (I ordered them anyway).His attention to detail doesn't stop after the sale or even after delivery. He's dedicated to helping the end user (me) work through the problems that seem inevitable with new systems -- usually traceable to Microsoft or Intel. Matt clearly is concerned with having a strong long-term relationship with customers. As far as the product itself, I'm extremely impressed. It runs fast, yet very cool. While typing this review, the 24 cores range from 31\u00b0C to 37\u00b0C. Even more impressive is the silent operation. I don't know if it's due to the extra fan Matt suggested, but it's extremely rare for me to hear any sound at all even under heavy use -- and it's never loud.I'm using built-in graphics, so I can't comment at all on the graphics performance.The NUC13RNGi9 from SimplyNUC perfectly fits my use case -- heavy Excel use. There's really nothing else I could ask of it. I cannot recommend all three strongly enough: the 13th gen NUC, Simply NUC & Matt Boone."
