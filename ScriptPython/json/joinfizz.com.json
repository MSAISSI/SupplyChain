          "Contenu": "I'm new to the world of regularly using a credit card month to month So this is my practice card. So far I like it.The only things I don't like as much are setting categories, paying them off at the end of the day, lack of reminder notifications from fizz.I have a grocery store that I shop at and it always gets marked as food and restaurants instead of groceries. So if you have the strange sounding grocery store, it's going to get marked as food and restaurants instead on your 3x bonus select food and restaurants.I am forgetful on if I have enough money in an account. I don't get notifications and I skim them like every 2 weeks. So if I miss a payment I won't know for until I check my email.Last thing is I wish I could pay them sooner than the end of the day cuz I've had times where I just completely forget about the fizz payment that I made earlier that day. My days meld together cuz everyone else's night is my day and my day is their nights. Other than the system and my system being confused on my purchases I think it's a great upcoming service that is currently in the potential phase and will move on to the fantastic phase."

I do wish they had more reward affiliates, and their help chat can take a bit long to respond, but otherwise I highly recommend it so far."

          "Contenu": "I have been using Fizz for approximately 3 months and I love it. It helps me build discipline in knowing that my credit limit is not extensive, and thus I have to use the funds available in a smart way as it will be charged to my bank later that day. The reward system is also very generous, as you can choose the spending category in which you want to earn points. So far, I haven\u2019t found anything to complain about regarding the card, but one thing I am wondering is how often the credit limit can be redetermined. Lastly, I think the auto pay function is a benefit that I\u2019ve enjoyed greatly. I have seen on my Experian report that the consistency in making those Fizz payments is positively affecting my credit and I can\u2019t wait to see how much more I can grow my credit with Fizz. I honestly don\u2019t see myself going back to the conventional credit card as this ensures that I don\u2019t spend money I don\u2019t have nor that I get myself into difficult positions with overspending my credit limit. I hope that others can benefit as much as I have from this card."

          "Contenu": "Fizz has been a very easy means for me to build credit without worrying about debt, potential late fees, and interest. Almost everyone wants to build credit, but credit cards aren't for everyone. Some people are not good at managing spending, so they might rack up debt or hit their credit limit. This isn't an issue with Fizz, since your spending limit is based on how much you actually have in the bank. The lack of interest is one of the biggest advantages to Fizz. There is no APR or interest due while using Fizz. This means a lot to me because I am a practicing Muslim, and interest is forbidden in our faith. Without Fizz, I would have to keep a close eye on a credit card to make sure I'd never be charged interest, but still run the risk of it. Fizz is a gamechanger.Last but not least, Fizz's customer service is excellent. Shout-out to Kidus! He was very responsive and attentive for every issue I faced, and either gave me solutions or a promise to get back to me with an answer, which he did. If you're not using Fizz by now, you're missing out, genuinely. I highly recommend building credit with Fizz!"
