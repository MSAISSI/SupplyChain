However, the device does not stay snapped to the chest strap for anything other running. I tried using during CrossFit workouts and it constantly fell off. I tried swimming with it and it fell off. Finally after only six months of use it stopped taking a charge and stopped working all together. For such an expensive product I expected more. Total disappointment. Once more the customer service is not helpful at all. Neither is the support team. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!"

That should be an optional feature; Bad return item process - appaling have to go to a google meeting video call with 8 support people to be able to send back a product that I am not satisfied with. No questions should be asked; And the X2 should have also ANT+ not just bluetooth. Only after complaining they sent me the return label, which I used to send back the product straight away on the same day. Next day it reached them warehouse and they simply stopped answering me on them support email and I still did not receive a refund. This is a very dodgy practice."

I spent a few hours yesterday searching for it after it became detached while doing some chores around the yard.   It's now really banged up with a lot of scratches.Also, the micro-usb charging process is very vulnerable to damage from dirt, sweat, or water.  The flimsy plastic cap is easily lost when it's removed for charging.   99.9999% of the engineering effort went into the electronics and the remainder went into making sure the unit stays attached and charged. My advice, wait for the next version.   Maybe FF will fix these glaring design issues.   In the meantime, I've got a banged up unit that I'll sell - cheap."

I double checked with a proper ECG stress test which says my heart is 100% healthy. The algorithm probably picks up noise and misclassifies it as an abnormality making it rather useless as an ECG monitor actually. Good thing was that I got a one-on-one meeting scheduled with their support but unfortunately they did not show up at the scheduled time."

They will record a video call during this process, but will delete the video upon customer request and data privacy concerns.The device itself appears to be quite accurate at rest or during sleep. The live ECG shows clearly visible premature contractions coinciding with felt palpitations and you can easily tell whether they\u2019re of ventricular or atrial origin. That shows me that it is clearly not recording fantasy data, but your real cardiac activity. It also accurately diagnosed episodes of atrial fibrillation. Those details are also visible when moving, but the overall ECG will show noise from movement artefacts, so that the ECGs are not so useful to identify details beyond heart rate & rhythm. At least I haven't yet found a way to interpret them otherwise.I assume that movement is a challenge for such a small device and I had been searching for an ECG tracker for quite some time. This is by far the best device I\u2019ve found so far. The team is quite active and appears to be keen on constantly improving the device. I\u2019ve received a couple of firmware updates & one can expect that the device gets even better with time."

And as for the non-Sinus Rhythm events, all you see is a simple pie chart showing the percentage of the time during the workout that you we not in sinus-rhythm. This is helpful, but it would be much better to have these events flagged on the ECG, so you wouldn't have to hunt for them."

          "Contenu": "I'd been considering changing my Garmin HRM-RUN for a FF X2 for some time and finally took the plunge.I'm bradycardic (resting HR in the low 30s) which still freaks my wife out although I've had an ECG with my GP. While the ECGs have said all is ok, I have always wondered if there was a reason why I struggle to raise my HR above around 160bpm, and also when my pace slowing towards the end of really long runs, is my HR dropping because I'm slowing or am I slowing because my HR is dropping? Not easy to simulate lying on a bed in a GP surgery!Good Stuff:Heart seems to be working fine if slow.Heart Strain remains minimal through out my runs.Still no reason why I can't get above 160bpm but engine seems ok.FF App decided to stop assigning GPS data to my runs on a couple of occasions but submitted a query and all was resolved really quickly and efficiently.Improvements?:Would be great if data recording would start and finish with my watch. Sometimes the overview at the end comments that my Cadence is too low but that's because I've stopped my run and had a chat or driven home before remembering to stop the X2.Have worn the X2 while sleeping and dataset says 98% Other Rhythm but this appears to be due to my low Resting HR rather than any weirdness in the rhythm. Would be good if it could 'learn' that this is normal for me perhaps?"

          "Contenu": "I bought the Frontier Heart Monitor at the beginning of July 2022, having been diagnosed a little earlier with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). Having learnt that certain minerals and vitamins had a supportive  effect on the heart. I could tell if my heart was getting better (or worse) and I would also be able to see if I was in PAF as my condition was asymptomatic. This device seemed to be the ideal choice. Toward the end of July this year, it kept dropping out of the blue-tooth connection to the app and finally stopped working altogether. On contacting the support group I was instantly e mailed reboot instructions. So back in business I carried on but a couple of days later it happened again, increasing and causing me great inconvenience. I was then asked to send a video of the device as there seemed to be something not right with the blue button, and approximately 10 days later was offered a replacement on return of the old one. I was then told that the new device a Frontier X2 would be sent on the Friday and the next morning I received it in a brand new box with all of accoutrements. I cannot thank the support team enough for their care and efficiency and would have given a 5 Star if it hadn't broken down in the first place and also a couple of additional app issues.Issue 1, I do not agree with the HRV (heart rate variation) explanation, My arrhythmia results simply don't tally. 2, Running, 'Cadence' (no. of steps per minute) is worked out as an average over the full time the app is running. So stop to cross a busy road, stop to tie a shoelace, stop by falling over, Cadence becomes 0. Stop the app after cooling down or warming up before starting the run, Cadence will drop significantly, Once again I strongly recommend this device for health as well as exercise and for the support you will get if something goes wrong."

In fact, intense training sessions on a cycle have apparently eliminated my need for anti-arythmic drugs. P-waves are consistently present regardless of HR , 52 (basline pulse) - 150 BPM (my set max HR). Being able to monitor this post work-out (I don't live stream) is a huge benefit. I do experience quite a bit of R to R variance on EKG. Some of this is actual PVCs that I can see on the rhythm strip. I'm told this is not pathologic; it shows up as \"other\" in HRV. I've also experienced some recently troubling failure of HR to accelerate on demand - just sits at around 75% max. Its occurrence is also rare but possibly indicates a developing AV block that may require an on-demand pacemaker. (I'll leave that to my cardiologist). The EKG feature has been great in keeping me clued in. I can't share it with my cardiologist because his in-hospital network won't allow it (They're in the process of changing over). I find the recommendations for next workout to be no more than boiler plate - I ignore it. Needs improvement that is relevant to my actual training load. The total workload displays are excellent allowing me to compare my cycling work-outs both on good days and bad. The weekly totals allow me to skip a work-out for recovery or, if I'm feeling it in a good way go ahead and safely press it a bit. There is no question that this is the best, most cardiovascular comprehensive wearable device I've used."

FF's Support was very good with my initial inquiry when I was experiencing connection issues between the HRM and my Garmin 1030+ (intermittent and loss of signal, HRM freezes, loss of workout data, and under-reporting of HR levels in real time to Garmin).   Then after reasonable follow up by their Support Team, communication stopped and I have been unable to reach them.   I asked if they would consider a \"trade in\" to replace my Frontier X with their new X2 (that addresses some of my issues) but no response.   See detail below for another user's similar issues.   It's difficult to justify a $500 HRM that cannot handle the basic (wahoo, Garmin, etc) HRM functionality.   BTW - I (tried to) use the FFX as my HRM for cycling with normal rides of 3-6 hrs in duration.from Mark Lewis \"I have had this for a few months now,, and felt the need to edit this. For pure ECG this kit is great, but as a HR monitor to connect to other devices, its simply awful. Its overly complicated compared to rivals, and very often just does not display any HR at all, and ends up having to be reset. During rides its a 3or 5 second average of HR for some reason, which isnt particularly usefull, and once or twice an hour will drop out for no reason. Having compared side by side with wahoo and a garmin (wearing both) it just isnt up to spec on this side for the price. Which is very disappointing, considering this should be the easy bit to get right\"** update as of Sep 2022...Fourth Frontier has addressed the issues I was having...with great response from their customer service group after a few attempts to reach a knowledgeable person relative to the device issues I was having."

Their customer service reached out promptly when I posted a comment on facebook at how happy I was, and the interaction has been super quick and relevant. Highly recommend.Edit - I have had this for a few months now,, and felt the need to edit this. For pure ECG this kit is great, but as a HR monitor to connect to other devices, its simply awful.

Having compared side by side with wahoo and a garmin (wearing both) it just isnt up to spec on this side for the price. Which is very disapointing, considering this should be the easy bit to get right.That said, the ECG strips are great, and this leaves me in a dilema, I honestly think I am going to have to wear two HR monitors, because I want the ECG, but I need accurate HR reads too for maintaining zones while cycling.Customer service has been, well a tad bleak too I might add, initially pretty responsive, but having gone to them with a bug, I feel I have been pushed aside and ignored somewhat, being nearly a month since I responded to their conclusion with what I felt was a pretty rational response. In this instance it was around the buggy nature of the FIT files that their back end software creates, I have as yet been unable to upload a single one to any software (strava, garmin etc) and have it not either bug out, or just not upload at all as its \"corrupt\". Customer service blames Strava, but clearly this is not unique to stravva, and is across all platforms pointing back to the fit file being the issue. I have dropped my rating to 3 our of 5 stars based on its still market leading for ECG in my view, but falls short everythwere else.Edit 2: One year on and this product has become a little more \"finished\". Multiple firmware updates have seen what was a bit clunky get a lot smoother. I get better (But not perfect) connections to my garmin while still using it connected to my phone, but mostly the back office algorithms  have massively improved. They now spot and identify rythm issues and you can easily find them in your recording, and usefully a lovely little pie chart of sinus rythm vs non sinus is displayed next to each workout in the list, great idea. Definately getting more and more usefull, the long term stats addition is great too for spotting trends in  HR/Breathing etc. With these updates I have increased to 4 stars. 5 for me would be perfect connection to all devices and good response times to HR variability during workouts, negating the need to wear two straps when exercising."

As a user of an Apple Watch Ultra, Oura Ring, Whoop, and Polar HR monitors, I have learned quite a bit about biometrics and wearables and the X2 provides a wealth of real-time information. I like the idea of using breathing rate as an indicator of strain versus solely relying on heart rate as most apps and wearables do.Customer service is very good so far as well. I have received prompt responses to my questions. I look forward to using the X2 to further improve my health and athletic performance."

If the X2 reveals anomalies I may need to wear the little box , but in the meantime it's my best friend. I am looking forward when my X2 will be used not for medical purposes but to monitor my workout progress and good health. In the meantime, the X2 gives me some reassurance.It's a great product backed up with a very good customer service.Congratulations."

I have the potential for SVTs which hopefully the latest attempt at stopping them (May 8th) will prove fruitful. I'm looking forward to interacting with the technical folks regarding details of my ECG signals. As I am ramping up my training and using the FFX2 as a guide to my progress, I am going to sign up for at least 2 months of tech support to go over data details during my workout sessions. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. If you have cardiac challenges - this is the product to get."

I learned that if I pushed myself too hard, I could get a couple of weird symptoms, but  as long as I kept my heart strain below a particular threshold (0.08 in my case), I could safely exercise. Without this, I likely would have been afraid to exercise at all, which would have prolonged the recovery period.Not a lot of difference between the Frontier X and the Frontier X2. A bit faster data transfer, but the same reliable information, presented in an easy to read format.I rely on my Frontier X, and it's been a great product. I highly recommend this."

          "Contenu": "I use Frontier X, the first version, since 1 year now.The device works surprisingly well. It produces a nice, stable single lead ECG approximately equivalent to V5 even during heavy training sessions. The online app adequately indicates premature ventricular beats and bigeminy. A registration during several hours at rest nicely shows the influence of caffeine or alcohol intake on the occurrence of premature beats. The device is also easily recognized by Zwift, so it is very useful for indoor sessions"

          "Contenu": "My Fourth Frontier is mainly used to record my heart problems. Last year, I emailed some ecg results to my Cardiologist as I was having approximately 1500 extra beats per day and episodes of multiple extra beats as I thought. Based on what he saw, he changed my medication to reduce my extra beats to a more managable level. He also confermed that  I had AF again, I had two ablation operations 9 years ago. Having a Fourth Frontier means if i'm feeling unwell I can check what is happening in real time, as I can see live data on the smart phone app. I can also get a full 24hour recording if needed and as I have done before, email it to my Doctor/Cardiologist.Cost wise it is equal to my Omron ecg monitor. But for use it is much better, as you can record for as long as you want or the battery lasts, the Omron can only do 30 seconds. Looking at my ECG's I can even tell if the extra beat comes from the top or bottom chambers of the heart.  I've never been to a hospital appointment before where the cardiologist knew what he was going to do before I even entered the room, thanks to the Fourth Frontier ECG's I had sent him previously. Overall an excellent piece of equipment, compatable price wise with some medical grade ECG equipment, but so much easier to use especially for irregular heart beats."
