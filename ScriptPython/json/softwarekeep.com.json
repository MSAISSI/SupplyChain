After 24 hrs of 3 phone calls multiple emails.I had to finally ask for a refund because customer services could not get it done. If you want to know why the delay you have to call them they will not call you back.  Their comment that it will take 10 to 15 minutes for the downloads to activate could be days. So if you need your software right away, look some where else."

I had to call back and talk with him again at which point he accessed my computer using Zoho and helped directly.  Only then did I receive a new key.  He initially installed a version that didn't work on my computer, which took over 30 minutes.  He then had to install a different version, which took another half hour.  Throughout the time he was assisting me, there would be times I would ask questions in the chat and it would take at lest 5 minutes for him to respond.  It was also somewhat frustrating that he relentlessly kept asking me to complete the review before he finished helping me- even after I told him more than once that I would complete the review after everything was completely installed.  Overall, very terrible experience.  I will not use Softwarekeep in the future and will not recommend it to anyone I know.  Joe was polite and eventually got the job done, but it took much longer than it should have."

I first tried a 20% coupon code their Tech Talk \"commercial\" Youtube video recommended but that was invalid. Then when I set up my account their website offered me a 12% coupon code in a pop-up, so I used that. My invoice was processed, a person assigned to my purchase, and information on my Microsoft Account provided via email as they requested. I received confirmation that my order would be processed within 2 business days. I was already on a tight timeline to complete the installation on 5 PC's. Then I received an email from a different person saying they would not honor the 12% discount because in the fine print Office 365 products were excluded. I didn't see any of that during my purchase. Why would it allow me to complete the purchase if it was not valid? They told me that I would need to complete a second purchase and not use the coupon code this time. After already processing my invoice and work being started. I asked them to cancel my purchase and went direct through Microsoft instead. They did process a refund invoice immediately. I wasted 2 days on this, checking their reviews, shopping for the right product, asking questions, and going through their order steps. Disappointing in the end."

All those customers ordering items that you do not have the product keys for but you have there money. Not a bad way to build some interest in the bank account. Bad buisness practice."

I just wish they wouldn't boast about getting the link within 30 minutes and even display a timer unless they are completely sure it is possible to send in that time frame. Other than that everything went smoothly just disappointed about the amount of time it took to receive the link."

The person on the other end asked what kind of computer I had, and I told them a Mac.  They then told me that I had ordered the Windows version and gave me a link to the Mac version.-  They then cancelled my order and started to process a refund.-  I went back to the shopping cart and the version in the shopping cart said \"for windows and mac\".-  I sent an email to \"Chase\", who I guess is the owner or manager or customer service dude, with a screenshot of what I ordered and an explanation of what had happened. - 24-hours later..... no response.- I clicked on the link sent to me to purchase the Mac version.  Went through the checkout process and processed my payment.-  The payment never processed.  It just sat there.... and sat there... and sat there....  All the buttons on the page were disabled so I couldn't go back, or try again.-  I finally just gave up and ordered it directly from Microsoft.  It was more expensive, but at least I know that Microsoft is a reputable company.UPDATE:  A representative from the company reached out after seeing my review and apologized for the experience.  I appreciated the contact and have adjusted my rating based on the follow-up."

License shows up related to my account but when I called Microsoft they told me it was a one time use license and coultd not be reused.   Dealing with support has been ridiculous.  They had me uninstall software on my old laptop and before installing on new and still I cannot use the license.   Software support called me and initiated a desktop support session which got disconnected and they never called me back.  I now have no usable software.  Sent an email to the desktop support team with all documentation and screen shots and then send back a survey?  This all started when I purchased MS home and office 2016 from them and they couldn't deliver a license number, so instead they \"upgraded\" me for free and sent a MS Pro Plus license number which is useless now.   I asked for them to just send me the license number for the software I paid for and still have not received a response. And I still do not have software reinstalled to use.  Wish I had pressed them for a refund to begin with.. I have a receipt for software I was never provided a key for.  Headed to the Microsoft site to get the software I need.  Microsoft told me directly that the license I was sold is no longer valid.UPDATE SINCE MY ORIGINAL POSTING>  Software keep immediately after seeing the awful review sent me a new product key and then started calling me about every 4 hours trying to get in touch with me to ensure the software could be installed and the key was valid.Since the key was always the issue, once I had a new key the installation was no problem."

Both Joe and Jesus (I mistakenly cut him off) requested me to snip a screen, something I have never done. Too much pressure to learn it while on a chat (I'm 78). I suggested that both just go to the sites I was given in the email and see what I saw. But by the time I sent the suggestion in, Joe gave me a new location from which to download. From then on it was a piece of cake. Thanks Joe (and Jesus)!Bob"

I used the online chat and remote access for a tech to try to install the SW but the first attempt loaded for half an hour and failed at <40%. A second tech then had me load directly from Microsoft itself (I had never done this and he had to do it by remote access). That downloaded in minutes. The tech did all the clicks and MS Office loaded fine. Overall the process is excessively cumbersome and next time I'd pay for the software on a memory stick or other physical medium but the technical support was very good."

I thought I had it solved once they sent me a new key but I had to run. Got stuck in heavy traffic, missed my appointment, paid parking fees for naught. Then realized much later that the company sent me the wrong installer. My day was pretty much trash.I contacted tech support expecting to get the run-around. Joe sent me the correct installer, I dowloaded, verified and installed the software within the 5-10 minutes we were chatting. All tech support should be this swift. I know this sounds like I'm laying it on but it's the little things that can make your day."
