          "Contenu": "I puchased a shiatsu massager & took very good care of it. I used it twice weekly, three times at most, so not excessively heavy use. I purchased it 5 September 2021 & it just stopped working on 17 December 2023 so it appears renpho massagers last 2 years maximum with mild use & probably less with heavy use. This throw away consumerism is beyond a joke. What a waste of money & I really need this as a disabling chronic pain sufferer. So if buying renpho expect to need to buy a replacement at or near 2 year mark. No wonder warranties by renpho are only 1 year. I suspect decent or heavy use means replacement purchase needed just over 1 year when outside of warranty! I might just soothe pain the old fashioned way through alcohol & meds!"

Asked to have supervisor call me, but noone called. I'm normally a patient and fair person, but this company does not care about customers.

My experience with the product was less than satisfactory - it arrived completely broken and wouldn't turn on. When I reached out to Renpho for support, they were unhelpful and suggested I contact Amazon instead.Amazon offered to cover my shipping expenses for the return, but the process was far from smooth. I ended up spending more on shipping than I was reimbursed for, leaving me out of pocket for a product that was never even functional.Overall, I would strongly recommend against purchasing the RENPHO massage gun on Amazon. Not only is the product of questionable quality, but the lack of customer support from Renpho is unacceptable. It's simply not worth the hassle or the money - consider investing in a massage gun from a more reputable brand instead.\""

          "Contenu": "I purchased the RENPHO massage gun on Amazon and was excited to try it out, but my excitement was short-lived. When I received the product, it was completely broken and wouldn't even turn on. I reached out to Renpho, only to be told that Amazon was responsible since they sold the product. This was incredibly frustrating, as I expected better customer service from a company that claims to care about their customers.I contacted Amazon, and while they offered to cover my shipping expenses, I was only reimbursed for $46, despite spending $94 on shipping costs. This was a huge inconvenience and only added insult to injury. As a result, I lost a considerable amount of money due to Renpho's faulty product and Amazon's lack of proper quality control.In summary, I do not recommend purchasing the RENPHO massage gun from Amazon. The product is poorly made, and the customer service provided by Renpho is non-existent. Additionally, Amazon's inadequate handling of the situation only added to my frustration. Save yourself the hassle and purchase a massage gun from a more reputable brand with better customer support.\""

There are so many bad reviews regarding their app with similar issues as recent as January and going up to a year ago; however, their response is \"we'll pass this on to our technical department\". Doesn't look like they care to listen to their customers. Their customer service is a joke and is usually not available. The first time I called in, I kept getting an answering machine. On the third try, I finally left a message. If you want to return their product, due to the product not functioning as advertised, you could be subject to return shipping and restocking fees. When they did respond to my concerns through email, and provided the steps to connect to Apple Health as though the scale not connecting properly was my fault (I've only had an Iphone for over 10 years and have connected plenty of apps/scales without any issue) they suggested I provide my app account email so that they can forward it to the Technical Team for investigation. I also purchased their food nutrition scale which is a two star at best. It is not user friendly at all. This company definitely makes my top five worst companies I've ordered from, and would never recommend them to anyone."

At no point before this, did they contact me to inform me of what had happened or offer a refund. I asked them to resend the product, which they did. I asked for them to provide a tracking number, they did not. Once again, when the product had not turned up within the allotted time frame I contacted them and was informed it had been delivered. They finally provided a tracking number and told me to contact the courier. When I contacted the courier, I was informed that Renpho, had not provided the correct address or my email address, so the post office would have contacted them, rather than me that the item had arrived. Renpho did not pass this information on to me. I like the scales, they are accurate and are exactly what I wanted, however, the frustration, and angst I had to go through to get them was not worth it. I do not recommend dealing with Renpho. Their products might be good, but their poor communication, incompetence and unprofessionalism, is a huge deterrent."

          "Contenu": "This purchase was the premium leg massager. I've also bought a Bluetooth scale and a Bluetooth tape measure from Renpho, and I've been very happy with those items. They're easy to use, they're accurate, and they communicate well with the Renpho app. Regarding the leg massager, though; in my opinion, I think the advertising copy should be more specific about the fact that this is a compression \"massage.\" I could be wrong, but I think most people think of a massage in terms of a percussive action, or maybe a kneading action, or both, whereas this leg massager is really neither. Instead, it provides steady pressure over the whole area covered by each section (thigh, calf, foot), and progresses, one section at a time. It does provide good -and adjustable- pressure, but it's just not what I think most people would equate with a massage.Renpho customer service is responsive and pleasant to deal with, but I'd suggest purchasing something as expensive as this leg massager from Amazon. The Renpho return policy cost me about $65. This purchase was $80, and I was given the options to 1) return it, at the expense of an estimated $35 restocking fee and $25 shipping, or 2) keep it and take $15 off the price. I'm not blaming Renpho; this policy is probably stated on their website, and I just missed it because I'm not detail-oriented. But it's worth mentioning here"

Worse, when I asked for a paid return label with the above description, they asked me to take a video to record the rattle, as if I could while using the massager, and ignoring the other two issues mentioned above.  Addendum: The manager has called, apologized, and fully refunded for the massager."

This is very disappointing.Update: I talked to a customer service representative on the phone, she said she could do nothing and advised to send another email to customer service. I did so and got a reply that nothing could be done since the order was cancelled. I got my money back. But then, I received the massager in the mail. So now I have a free massager. And I love it! I just wish their customer service was more adequate."

The first phone call to customer service said they were backed up from Black Friday and to call back in 48 hours if not shipped, which it was not and required more follow up.  The last phone call for customer service said the business closed for 4 days for Thanksgiving. So my friend's birthday was Dec 3 but no one or the website said the shipping would be delayed due to Thanksgiving holidays. Love the product and the price. Preferred to order direct instead of third party website but you really need to let folks know you will be out or an estimated shipping date."

          "Contenu": "Renpho Foot Spa with Massager.I am diabetic and also have mobility issues. I cannot reach my feet to wash and dry them so I bought this to see if it would help.There are a couple of fundamental design flaws. The removeable cover does not fit well, and it is impossible to use the carry handle with the cover in place.It is very heavy with water in it, and the cable is not very long. I had to plug it into an extension to use it at my desk. Also, it would be handy if there was a cable storage facility, as there is nowhere to put the cable when transporting or storing the unit.I cannot reach the controls when my feet are in the bath under my desk, and the controls are hard to see. It would be helpful if the control buttons were illuminated.To overcome this I used a torch and one of those rubber topped pens you get for touch screens.Getting my feet in was not easy, as there is not much access room.The heater is a nice touch and the bubbles felt good. More importantly after 20 minutes my feet were much cleaner than when they went in.The worst thing about this product is the discomfort caused by the casing putting pressure on my legs during the process. I sat upright to avoid an awkward angle, but it seemed that no matter where I placed my feet, my legs were pressed against the side or the front, which was uncomfortable, bordering on painful. Even after I got my feet out, I could feel the pressure marks on my legs for some time.I wish I had found a better one, and now that I have used it I suppose I can't return it, which is disappointing. I will therefor persevere with this one and hope it gets easier to use as time passes."

Shipping took forever as tracking showed my order bouncing around California for a week."

I was especially interested in the prospect of linking the new scale with other health and nutrition trackers, including MyFitnesPal.  Unfortunately, I was unable to get the scale to do any of these things.  All it does is record my current weight.  *The old scale no longer even records my current weight, instead always offering only the same figure--which is less than half of what I actually do weigh!"

No other feelings, absolutely nothing at all. It works just like an electric blanket for the back, nothing else.   I believe, RENPHO got a lot of improvement to make to make this pad working and popular. But I am very grateful for their scale, that's smashing and helping me to monitor my weight controlling efforts. Thanks for that. This is why I am giving 3 star by looking at the brand. But considering the Massage pad, it deserves 1 star or less. I hope, my review would be helpful for both RENPHO and the potential customers."

Also, the buttons are too close together and when I'm changing the programs, I push the wrong button and have to go through the whole series again or sometimes turn it off and back on.

          "Contenu": "I purchased The Scales, Foot massager and Smart bike in one hit with a 10% off coupon. After spending a few hours for a few nights researching smart bikes and foot massagers. I started to narrow my focus onto the Renpho range. I ended up selecting the Renpho Smart bike because of the reviews on its price, quality build and the fact that it has resistance control via its free app with bonus compatibility with other reputable bike apps like zwift. After trying the App and doing a power test I found it to be quite awesome. As mentioned by the reviews, you do need to download some courses which takes time so better to do it well in advance of training on the bike. The app also has had issues connecting to my apple health app. I haven\u2019t yet sorted that out so the way around it for me is to open the Renpho AI Gym app on my Apple Watch which will record my indoor ride with heart rate. Or alternatively use my Apple Watch indoor bike workout.  My wife is in Love with the Shiatsu foot massager. I personally am not into foot massage machines. The scale are good and do the job well.  The software unfortunately doesn\u2019t support my body type which is very athletic. But I\u2019m probably not the target market. I still find much of the stats good even if it does think I\u2019m overweight which is because of my muscle mass. Keep up the great work Renpho And please address issues with frequent updates. Highly recommend the brand based on price, quality and after purchase support. Software isn\u2019t perfect yet but I know they are really trying to make everything work."

THEN my uncle purchased three units at my urging!I even had a problem with one of the units, and after a couple weeks of testing, Renpho sent me a brand new unit!  The problem was with a sensor and not the filtration itself.I can always do business with a company that will stand behind their product and deliver on their word. This filtration unit has made a huge difference in my congestion that I used to wake up with each morning.   Also, I am not aggressively clearing my throat as I used to do, almost habitually!  I have much fewer occurances of stuffy nose because the air and crap is filtered over and over again!I really enjoy my Filter unit!"

          "Contenu": "I received the Renpho eye-massager for this past Christmas from my husband, a great guy who is always at a loss as to what to buy for me that might be a surprise. One early December Sunday, we were watching the CBS morning show that included a review by David Pogue of cool, new  \"techno\" gifts. As I oohed and aahed through the segment, my hubby was taking mental notes, and actually surprised me with a few of the reviewed products - one being the Renpho Eye Massager. Oh my goodness! I had no idea what the box contained, but my husband instructed me to just open up the headset and put it over my eyes. At once, the soft pads went to work, massaging pressure points around my eyes and temples while soothing sounds (which may be turned off) piped through the unit. It was absolutely heavenly! Stress, headaches, and tight muscles melt away while you're under the relaxing spell of the massager.After I finished my minutes of Nirvana, I took off the headset and passed it around so my family members could try it out. They loved it so much that our adult daughter ordered her own set after she returned home, and I went on to purchase another set as a gift. I highly recommend the Renpho Eye Massager. It's a perfect gift and a welcomed antidote for the over-worked and media-weary friends in your life. : )"
