          "Contenu": "Edited - Confirmed reproduction copy of the game.I got one DS game and a few ds replacement cases that were advertised as, \"Retail Cases.\" Nowhere in the listings were the words, \"Reproduction Cart\" mentioned. The case and cart, while decent quality and not obviously reproduction, are indeed reproduction. This is not a problem to me personally, but I am beyond annoyed that this was not mentioned to me ahead of time. Same thing for the game cases. They were advertised as 3DS reproduction retail cases. They are functional cases, but clearly, cheap knock-offs that only vaguely resemble authentic 3DS game cases. Will not shop again. Cannot recommend anybody risk purchasing from this shop.Response to comment - As I said in this initial review. I do not have any issues with reproduction game materials, but what I do have an issue with is not labeling reproduction content as such on your website. Allowing a return will not change my opinion or review of your website and my review was not an attempt to get refund/return. Simply a warning to other potential buyers of your objectively poor advertising."

I don't want to wait a second week for me to get my order so I cancelled my order today. I'm going to be very upset if they do not refund my payment.  And judging by other reviews I probably won't get my payment. I may take legal action if I don't receive a refund. As they seem to be running a fraudulent business practice.

I wrote them about the resealing practice a few days ago and haven't heard back. I can attest to the other reviewer's statement that we are receiving bogus shipping notifications, too, as I've received notification that my shipment mailed days ago, yet it had not actually been shipped.  Turnaround time seems to be about two weeks at this point. Not a great first impression and will attempt a return."

The next day I get a call from my 7 year old grandson saying he got the same game returned and that there was a note indicating the actual disc did not match the case it was in.  Well I did not open the original package received at Christmas time but wrapped it for his gift.  I can guarantee I returned the exact disc and case that I originally received. There is no way the discs could have been mixed up because he doesn\u2019t own any other Wii baseball games. I ordered MLB 2K11 but unbeknownst to me the case said 2K11 but inside was 2K8.

No where on their site does it warn when you are buying that orders over $100 must be shipped to the billing address. That is not common practice considering Amazon and other online business will still ship to shipping address."

The third party seller at no point disclosed that the console did not include a charger, original box, or anything. All I got was the console. The console was packaged poorly and sustained damage during shipping. The console was in a thin bubble wrap envelope that would only protect it from minor impacts but not from being dropped or handled roughly (you know, things that happen during shipping). There were no indications that the package was fragile.\u201cAll sales are final\u201d and all returns must be filed within 14 days... it takes 14 days to receive your package with how slow shipping is. Even if it arrives before then, customer service is non-existent, so good luck even initiating a return. Even if you get to return your purchase, they don\u2019t give refunds for returns, only store credit. They are scamming you out of your money. You would be better off buying directly from an eBay seller for a cheaper price. That way, you know exactly what you are getting."

          "Contenu": "I'm a collector and ordered Dragon Quest VIII on PS2. The condition said New. Anytime I wrote to ask questions (via Gmail and Facebook) I never received feedback, other than a few auto-responses to my gmail. I ordered anyways, seeing I understand backlogs, life, etc. Businesses get busy. What I received in the mail was a re-wrapped/resealed game, without the cover sleeve over top of the case (because this game came with one originally when it was actually new). When I opened it, there was no insert for the Final Fantasy XII demo inside, so this copy definitely isn't a complete copy. The worst part is the discs are all scratched up and it took me around 3 tries to finally get the game to play correctly. This is NOT a game in NEW condition and I DO NOT appreciate the misleading information. If it was advertised as mostly complete in fair/used condition, then I might've kept my expectations not so high, as well as, I would've never paid the price I paid. When you advertise something as NEW, people expect it to be NEW/SEALED, or VERY close, MINT condition even, but it wasn't. Yes, I bought out of my own discretion and I also understand that sometimes things happen. Businesses aren't always going to have a 100% perfect wrap sheet. Accidents happen, but I really feel like someone dropped the ball on this one."

I unscrewed it and on the board there was a battery save (MC does not save with a battery!) and no Nintendo logo anywhere on the board!

I checked the site on Tuesday and my order was still 'Processing', so I used the contact form to ask how many business days it takes to process an order before it ships.\r I received an email Wednesday stating that my order had shipped and should arrive in three to five days, with no further information.  A follow-up message asking for tracking information went unanswered.\r Today, the following Monday (six days after the 'three to five days' window; ten days after placing the original order), my order status on the web site changed to 'Shipped', and the tracking system shows that it had indeed not shipped until this afternoon.  The person who said it had already shipped had given me false information and did not acknowledge further inquiries.  I find this to be unacceptable and I will hesitate to order from this company in the future, despite the quite reasonable prices they offer.\r Taking a full week to 'process' an order before it ships is an whole other conversation - particularly since they accepted payment immediately, but would be excusable if a fair expectation was presented as part of the ordering process."

          "Contenu": "I purchased a copy of Mega Man Legends for the Playstation, to give some context.The speed at which it shipped was good, I have no complaints with how soon it arrived.However, Players Choice Videogames did not properly inform me of the shipping progress.  I got a shipping link well after I bought the game, and when I clicked on it, I got an error message.  But I can't pin this on PCV too precisely, and I got it quickly, so I'm not especially bothered by this detail.The price was nice, about the price I would like to buy this game at today.  Games from the fifth gen are more expensive than they used to be, so it's nice to finally experience a generation from before my time at a reasonable price.However, I've only played fifteen minutes and have problems with the quality.  For one, the opening sequence is glitched due to a scratched disc.  It runs fine until a certain point, then the voice audio starts to loop at the wrong line before cutting out entirely.  Then the cutscenes have consistent stuttering, not enough to completely ruin them, but anyone who loves the game will hate it, and I can't feel confident my experience is being negatively impacted by a low quality product.The disc is really scratched, which is a very uncomforting realization since the case came plastic-wrapped.  I realize that a game doesn't have to be new to come in the plastic, but it's such a common thought.  I'd rather the game had come in just the box, because this seems deceptive, intentionally or not.This is a small point, but when I buy a game where the website displays a specific box-art, I expect the case that holds the box art on the site.  What I mean is that the website lists the box art for MML in the CD case- the one with the awkward-looking 3D render.  But instead, I got a DVD-style case that looks more like it fits in my PS2 collection.  Again, this is a nitpick, but it means if I want this game to not stick out in my collection, I gotta buy another case with the art I expected.  Little inconveniences like this should be avoided.To recap, I'm giving PCV a 2/5 because I got a low-quality product that, while it works semi-decently now, could very well fall apart in a very short time.  If they could mention the quality of the game on their website, or if they could just up the quality of their copies, this should be a non-issue since I would know exactly what I was buying.  The other details were worth metnioning in my eyes, but not worth docking further points on their own."

          "Contenu": "I\u2019ve ordered a controller, a game, and a PS3 console from this store.The controller took a little while to ship but it worked fine. In fact it works better than my PS4 controller and it\u2019s a PS3 controller. But I\u2019ve had it for like a year I think and I still have yet to have any issues with it. The game shipped the quickest and also worked fineThe console shipped pretty slow and when I got it it was defective. It kept overheating really quickly and it was virtually unplayable. I couldn\u2019t be on it for more than like a few minutes before it would shut off from overheating. I contacted Players Choice and David offered a replacement one which works fine. I\u2019ve had the new one for about a month and I have no issues with it. Well I guess the only issue is that the controller that came with it doesn\u2019t really work, nor did the one that came with the first PS3 I got, but I just use the PS3 controller I originally got from players choice which, again works fine.All in all I guess the only real cons I have with buying from Players Choice is that some items take a while to ship, even when like realistically you\u2019d think they\u2019d be shipped about faster than they were, and like it\u2019ll say it \u201cshipped\u201d on the site on a date before it actually shipped, and the controllers that come with the consoles that get shipped to you may not work properly.(Mine didn\u2019t) but like other than that, the site is legit you get the products you order which generally work fine, and if you get a product that doesn\u2019t work you can just contact them about it and they\u2019ll replace it with one that does, so there\u2019s not really a hassle in that area.All in all, I was definitely satisfied with my service here and it\u2019s a pretty great site to order stuff from that aren\u2019t usually on the gaming market anymore."

The response to my query was immediate and in a few days, I did receive the games. The games were in great condition. The items did have to be shipped in two separate parcels, which were a few days apart. Not quite sure the reasoning for this, but they do have USPS trackers on them, so I\u2019m confident the second package will arrive with no setbacks. David with the sales team has been responsive and easy to communicate with. I definitely plan on getting more games, especially while the world is in quarantine!"

I was advised it was on the way and would arrive in 3-5 days. The next business day I received a tracking number as well. I have to say that it was received in time and within the 5 business days as advised in the email response. Quite different from the postings I have read on here. I believe that this company is working on better service, and I am thankful that they were able to provide my game to give to my grandson in time."

Local  dealers wanted at least 12-20 bucks for these titles.  Will definitely buy from this place again.  My only issue with the web site is that it lists games that are not currently in stock.  They should not show up when doing searches for games.\r Response to AnGiroux Cressman' comment:\rHere is an example of my issue. I want to purchase some SNES games \"today\".  When I do a search for all SNES games, I get around 24 pages of games to look thru.  While I am reviewing these games, I notice that 7-8 pages are filled with games that are currently not available.  I would like to view only games that are in stock.  This option is currently not available.  I am not interested in the price of a game that is not in stock because it may change once it becomes available again.  If I am going to trade-in an item, I know exactly what it is and will search for that one item, rather than looking thru a long list."

I got my console,my games in good condition well the paper mario tends to glitch sometimes but turns out some of them are like that. Then, I got a av cable, 32 mb memory card for the gamecube. Now, everything showed up, everything works good minus the controller that the gamecube came w/ but I don't like that I don't get my tracking number until I've contacted them that's the only issue I have. They were nice & sent me the info that I needed,but, other than that everything came, I got what I have purchased, games work & look good too. I'm so happy I got them & the website is actually legit, you get what you picked & payed for. It seem scary & a bit doubty but trust me it is what the website says it is, the customer service is great plus this website has more options in games & consoles in my opinion. If I had to rate it I'd be 4.5 stars out of 5 thank you guys so much for my orders."

Everything I have purchased from you guys have been in excellent condition which is surprising considering the age and previous use they've endured over the years. Buy from them! I've shopped around online and they are very competitive with their prices and shipping and their overall selection. Their prices are very competitive and they have products that can be very hard to find. You will not regret it. If you're unsure, buy here. You will like what you recieve.
