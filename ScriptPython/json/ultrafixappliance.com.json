          "Contenu": "Do Not hire this company!!! UltraFix Appliance Repair sent a technician to my home to fix a beverage cooler, the technician arrived reeking of marijuana, after an hour he said the unit was fixed. Within 5 minutes of his departure the unit was not working.  I called Ultrafix and they sent him back a few days later, again he arrived with the smell of marijuana wafting around him. He took a part the unit and worked on it for over an hour, I got a strange feeling he did not know what he was doing. Hindsight, the technician was clearly under the influence of illicit drugs, and I should have never let him in my home. Finally, he said he needed to order a part and that the office would call back the next day.  The next day they called to tell me the unit was not repairable, to just buy a new one.  Unbeknownst to them I had already had a company out that said they COULD fix it but couldn\u2019t come back for a month, the reason I called Ultrafix.  So, I called the original company back and scheduled to have the new part installed.  When the technician arrived with the new part, he saw that parts were missing, parts that were there his last visit before the technician for Ultrafix came.  I immediately called the Ultrafix technician and when he answered I asked about the missing parts, he immediately hung up and would not answer my calls after repeated attempts.  I called the office and spoke with \u201cRam\u201d the supervisor, he accused me of lying and would not offer any help whatsoever.  So, in a nutshell, they told me to trash a fixable $3000 refrigerator and thinking I was going to throw it out, they stripped parts out of it.  Again, do not hire this company!!!!!"

Not only that, but the technician had a raunchy window sticker of a girl tied up, a no free rides sticker of two people having sex, and the phone wallpaper, that was left laying around for anyone to see, was a black and white photo of a woman posing in lingerie. I have 3 kids under 5 years old. I would rather not explain to them why his sticker was a woman is tied up.I expected, based on the outside looks of the company \u2014 their branding and webpage \u2014 that I was hiring thoughtful professionals.Again, they got the problem fixed but I won\u2019t be hiring them again for the lack of awareness."

The repairman, Victor, was knowledgeable enough to realize the likely cause of the failure based on his knowledge of Kenmore refrigerators. He came with the necessary part and was able to diagnose and repair, clean up and had everything running back to normal before any food went to waste. All for a reasonable price. Thank you, Victor. Job well done."
